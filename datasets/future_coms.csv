Supply/Demand isn't exclusive to capitalism, it's a inherent force that is intrinsically linked to technology and population numbers. In fact what makes markets so popular in terms of the supply/demand problem is that they tend to consistently have way less overhead than other solutions; meaning the monster, however bad, is probably much smaller than it would have been with more vertical economies. 

The thing about markets is that they by definition are more easily influenced by their cultural environment - making politics and activism a much more active part of the economy.

Nuclear is a decent option when done right with Thorium reactors, but in order to eliminate most of the fossil fuel the production of those reactors should be ramped up like crazy BEFORE cutting off fossil fuels.

Other political factions mostly realize that you can't ""perfect"" or ""standardize"" humanity, and try to work with that fact. Under these systems you're typically allowed to enjoy a lot of liberties, with incentives to act in a globally conscious manner, and some policies against outright destruction of the environment, at the risk of leaving some room for abuse in the system. Not everyone will be motivated to act in the interest of their fellow man, but people who are doing so are doing it willingly and happily and are likely to encourage further support for these world-conscious policies.

Globalists would prefer to remove those choices and incentives, and basically force you into action, even if you weren't at risk for harming the environment in the first place. This is more likely to generate resentment for those policies than anything else, especially since the trade-off requires immediate and regular personal costs for benefits that you will only see in the long run or might not live to benefit from at all, leading to further disregard for the environment and their fellow man, and the eventual abolition of those policies.

We are close to making battery driven planes that can handle a lot of the short range flights, around the hour mark. Which is probably going to be quite successful in parts of the world. Cargo ships can quite easily and realistically go over to using wind energy, No need for energy density when you can harvest energy as you use it. 

The biggest reason oil and gas are needed is the fact that these changes aren't over night, and that it might still be economical to use oil and gas alternatives. Plus oil is still going to be used afterwards for all the other various products its used  in the petrochemical industry. 

wether or not shell is wrong in their assessment comes down to how quickly we can make these transitions, and how long their ""future"" is. As it stands now it seems very likely, but I believe we could increase our transition speed with better policies, but I dont think anyone believe we can realistically make a transition so quickly we won't need oil and gas for energy in the next decades, which is probably more than enough for oil and gas companies to make a profit on projects started today.

I think you're right, in a way.
We'll probably always want to understand certain judgments or diagnoses of AI in the future and therefore we'll develop theories. But the key point here is that we'll only develop those theories, about why the AI could be right, with hindsight. Perhaps, therefore, I should rather have asked the question as to whether the order of perception, theory formation, examination will be shifting in the future, to perception, examination, theory, although of course one would no longer  speak of examination, but maybe of investigation.

But, well, if we take the objections of the other commentators seriously, and stay with your cancer example: I wonder if the investigation of the AI, on the basis of which it determines the disease, does not have to precede a kind of theory. Maybe this can only be answered on a case-by-case basis, but maybe not. In this context, theory could also mean assuming that we have to examine the body in a certain way in order to find out what's wrong, so: is the selection of the data to be interpreted already based on a theory?

 Another possibility would be to define the judgments of AI as a kind of perception of reality. Also in this case the order would be preserved.",1571204883,f3wjd56,t1_f3urpgb,Futurology,t5_2t7no

Hydrogen fuel cells work great in theory and work out terribly in practical applications. It uses platinum (30.000,- dollars per kg) as a catalyst. Hydrogen is terribly inefficient to store and use. Hydrogen fuel cells have a very short lifespan and are very difficult to regenerate. Hydrogen is very inefficient to produce and store, the infrastructure to do so in large quantities would be hideously expensive. And as a fuel, hydrogen is volatile enough that a car can barely store enough for a 100km range if sufficient safety measures are taken.

It's one of those ideas that are great in theory but require decades worth of research and alternative components and processes before it's really viable.

My degree of care and concern is altruistic in nature, for those less fortunate of this generation who will suffer the effects most immediately as well as everyone in the coming generations.

I'll just say this for now: Starting with the Carboniferous era 300,000,000 years ago and until recently the concentration of atmospheric carbon was gradually reduced by the growth of plant life and sequestered under ground. Humans came along and dug up and burned that carbon and reintroduced roughly 1/3rd of it, or 100,000,000 years worth, into the atmosphere in only about 100 years. We fully understand the affect of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses on incoming and outgoing thermal radiation, and we understand that that is the only method by which heat enters or leaves Earth's thermodynamic system. We measure these things directly, with networks of satellites among other things. Each of our many direct and indirect measurements coincide with our expectations given our understanding of physics and the fact that we have added back into the atmosphere in 100 years an amount of carbon that took over 1 million times that long to be removed from it... which is just another way to say that global warming is both the expected and observed result of our activities given everything that we know about the natural sciences.",1571201252,f3wg4zr,t1_f3wf9am,Futurology,t5_2t7no

Have you read the IPCC reports? You ask for the science, it exists.

&gt;We are currently in the last part of an interglacial period. The temperature is getting cooler. In fact, it was warmer for 6,100 years of the last 10,000 years of the interglacial period.

With the exception of ""the temperature is getting cooler"" all of this is correct... and maybe 0.1% of people could have composed those sentences... I'm not sure how you can be this knowledgeable yet also apparently so ignorant. The average temperature is not getting cooler, and we know this with numerous direct and indirect measurements. We use a network of satellites to directly monitor incoming and outgoing infrared radiation... the expected result of increased atmospheric greenhouse gasses is reduced outgoing long-wave radiation and that is exactly what we have observed over time. Incoming short-wave radiation is relatively stable by comparison... all that heat is going somewhere, and it's not to power the growth of life... it's going into the oceans, which are rising due to thermal expansion, which we also measure. Another thing we measure is acidity of the oceans, which is also increasing due to absorption of atmospheric carbon, which is causing coral bleaching around the world.

Literally of the measurements that would have anything to do with this all point to the same reality... and this is all provided in excruciating multi-thousand page detail in the IPCC reports.",1571198610,f3wdfwn,t1_f3vtwhf,Futurology,t5_2t7no

342,AlbertVonMagnus,"You actually think you can make windmills and solar panels produce at night with ""higher penetration"" and ""greater geographic diversity""? (And yes, wind dies down at night in most regions)

Let's test the first idea, say you increase the number of solar farms on a grid five-fold and double their efficiency. They still produce zero power at night, so what is ten times zero? It's been a while since I learned this in grade school, maybe you didn't get that far yet, but I'm fairly certain the answer is still ""zero"".

Maybe ""greater geographic diversity"" could help. Where exactly does the sunlight go at night? Oh right, the other side of the world, about 12,500 miles away at midnight. Gee, I can't imagine any challenges in building a grid that long.

But maybe you don't actually understand why this is absurd so I'll explain. First, electricity generation must always match demand *perfectly* or the grid will fail. Even a state-wide grid is complicated to manage, let alone world-wide.

Second, you'd need to achieve lasting world peace and supreme diplomacy to establish a continuous power connection through friendly countries all the way to the other side of the world without it becoming a political weapon. Then you'd have to figure out how maintain said grid. Also the America's would need to build it underwater, that shouldn't cost much right?

Yet even if you accomplished these miracles and somehow coordinated generation with the other side of the world well enough to not destroy the grid as soon as goes online, by the time the energy travels through 12,000 miles of power lines, almost all of it will be lost to resistance anyway. Using rainbows and unicorns to power the grid would be less of a miracle. I can't believe I have to explain such intuitive, fundamental concepts.

So power at night is either coming from batteries, nuclear, or fossil fuels. Researchers at MIT have done the math for the first option, and MIT is usually considered to be pretty good at this ""engineering"" thing

https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611683/the-25-trillion-reason-we-cant-rely-on-batteries-to-clean-up-the-grid/

&gt;Building the level of renewable generation and storage necessary to reach the state's [California] goals would drive up costs exponentially, from $49 per megawatt-hour of generation at 50 percent to $1,612 at 100 percent.

&gt;And that's assuming lithium-ion batteries will cost roughly a third what they do now.

As for build time, I can't believe I need to explain that comprehensive statistics are always more useful than cherry-picked examples.

https://www.statista.com/statistics/712841/median-construction-time-for-reactors-since-1981/

&gt;The median construction time between for nuclear reactors between 2011 and 2015 was about 66 months.

66 months is five and a half years, in case you were wondering.

 But surely California can build solar faster than that, right?

https://www.energy.ca.gov/almanac/renewables_data/solar/

California generated about 27,000 GWh of solar power in 2018 (including solar PV + thermal solar)

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Verde_Nuclear_Generating_Station#Description

In 2017, Palo Verde produced 32,330 GWh of clean, consistent nuclear power.

You read that right. As of 2018, just **one** nuclear plant produced more power than **all** of the solar power in California. If the most solar-friendly state in the nation cannot build clean energy from solar faster than an *average* nuclear plant, then who can?

I look forward to hearing your grid expertise explain how MIT's analysis, Wikipedia's empirical facts, California's own government statistics, and the basic common sense that *solar panels need sunlight to produce electricity* are all incorrect.",1571198232,f3wd0ya,t1_f3tlowt,Futurology,t5_2t7no

What should and should not be done in private, or how much privacy you enjoy is a cultural thing, but there has always been a level of privacy from official government oversight that has been steadily eroded. The moment we started to keep official records and license various activities there has been a loss of privacy. When Og the Caveman had kids no-one recorded a thing. When Jack Soap decided to emigrate to the new world no-one knew if the name he gave at Ellis Island was his real name or not.

(Subsequently, these are also pretty stupid people, who rarely introspect or think about metaphysics.) However, just the fact that people appreciate music, jokes, literature, etc. tells me that they are open to the idea that materialism is not everything.

Anyway, I don't know how you'd change the world to be less materialistic. I think a cheap solution that might actually work is massively increasing the use of psychedelic drugs in society (for those who are capable). It doesn't require any systematic changes whatsoever, and will just open people's minds a bit.

The issue with that is that it will disrupt the status quo. People will rile against consumerism, capitalism, materialism. They'll rile against everything about the consensual view ""reality"" (capitalism, science, religion, tradition, etc. will get scrutinized). I don't know if that's a ""good thing"", it sure will force people to think a lot more about reality instead of assuming they already understand it; and instead of pretending like we define reality through our culture and technology, we will have to think about aligning ourselves with and respecting ""laws"" that are beyond our control.",1571194423,f3w88zm,t1_f3v4dgm,Futurology,t5_2t7no

and yes i get that average people are so sheltered as to have frankly disgusting views of the homeless, i have been homeless 3 times and people are shit. no one wants a homeless shelter near them becuase too many people have no idea what its like to actually have things hard (paying a mortgage and working 5 days a week isnt hard in the same way at all). i am also aware that some 50% of the homeless are just that, without their own home. one of the times i was homeless i couch surfed for months.

You, and most people in the left (and not centrist left btw) seem to forget that not every nation in the world is a warm cuddly friend waiting to help humanity progress into a utopian future.  There are nations who will literally wipe put entire peoples just to get ahead of their international competitors.

If you don't mobilize every resource at your disposal, the opposition will.  This is why the US has maintained an international super-army even thirty years after the cold war.  And for thirty years there have been no major wars.  No shifting borders (excluding some instances with Russia and China which goes to show how unstable things are even now with that mega army).

And no, it's not center left.  The ideological spectrum is pretty solid but opinions of masses shift over time.  Basically the whole world has moved to the left over history.

Socialism/communism in place of individual responsibility and a free market economy.  Hate speech and belief-based laws in place of freedom of speech and freedom of belief.

You, and most people in the left (and not centrist left btw) seem to forget that not every nation in the world is a warm cuddly friend waiting to help humanity progress into a utopian future.  There are nations who will literally wipe put entire peoples just to get ahead of their international competitors.  If we let them overtake us in the economy, then how do we stop them from going further?

If you don't mobilize every resource at your disposal, the opposition will.  This is why the US has maintained an international super-army even thirty years after the cold war.  And for thirty years there have been no major wars.  No shifting borders (excluding some instances with Russia and China which goes to show how unstable things are even now with that mega army).

And no, it's not center left.  The ideological spectrum is pretty solid but opinions of masses shift over time.  Basically the whole world has moved to the left over history.  But there are some principles, particularly in the US, which are now being overshadowed by some newer leftist ideologies.  Socialism/communism in place of individual responsibility and a free market economy.  Hate speech and belief-based laws in place of freedom of speech and freedom of belief.

The rest of the world generally never had these principles like the US did.  There are virtually no places in the world with as much protection of freedom of speech as the US.  And the ""rest of the world"" includes the nations that brought us imperialism, nazism, fascism, communism, monarchism, totalitarianism, multiple genocides, and two world wars.  Just because they're doing it doesn't mean it's right. Something something  all your friends  something something  jump off a cliff.",1571188984,f3w0b1k,t1_f3udpo7,Futurology,t5_2t7no

Almost the entirety of empty houses are focused in the midwest

When you convince the working and middle 99% to pay a dozen or so percent more in taxes to move people a couple hundred miles into a house they dont pay for and to also pay for their food, possible rehab, and all other living expenses, then the problem will be solved. 

and on barely affording food or rent, rent isnt bad whatsoever if you dont live in a megalopolis, a nice 1 bed apt. goes for maybe $600 near me, it's only expensive when you decide to live in the most populated cities known to mankind.

And people are not fucking starving. google anything you spout and tout before claiming it as true. 1 in 6 americans are food \*\*\*INSECURE\*\*\*, wanna know what that means? they don't have a stable source of food coming in themselves, that doesnt mean they dont have food, it just means that without outside aid they don't have enough. thing is, there's outside aid. food banks, charities, and a whole lot of programs offered at nearly every public school will give food insecure people free food. In fact, starvations are so rare in america that they really aren't recorded due to the rarity of it. the general statistic seems to be about 5000 a year, and even then a majority of those are elderly and children who are neglected. The world health organization said that in 2004 only about 120 people died from starvation. its a bit of an old statistic but i doubt it duplicated a significant amount since then. somewhere around 35% of america is obese, so even if we assume 100% of the 1% is obese, that means a solid 3rd of america eats too much food. in fact, statistics show obesity is more prevalent among those of lower incomes. You're entirely wrong on all accounts.

The only thing i'll concede on is the homeless people, but you're looking at it insanely watered down. many of the homeless people have severe substance abuse problems and need rehab before we can even imagine reintegrating them into society, the issue is, thats fucking expensive, and the majority of the cost would be shouldered by the working class, not to mention the bureaucratic nightmare that would come from somehow moving them from heavily populated areas into areas with low population and room for more people while convincing the people in that area that welcoming in possibly mentally unstable people who are possibly in need of help for mental issues or substance abuse is a good idea. you cant. how many people would be comfortable having a meth addict as a neighbor? even in most cases where the person really wants to recover, people wont care, they dont see him as a complex human being who's lived a life equally as full as theirs, they seem him as a simple label, ""crazed drug addict"". until you rid all of humanity of this label slapping dogma in which they view others as simple beings that consist of their most manifest traits, you wont convince people that it's a good idea. is that shitty? yes. i dont condone letting people die in the fucking streets. 

Oh mind you im talking solely about Unsheltered. let me open pandoras box on you: the majority of homeless people arent living on sidewalks. Some statistics from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development show that out of the 552,830 homeless people in the US in 2018,  358,363 are sheltered. they have a place to sleep at night, they have a place to eat and bathe, they just dont have their own house. These stupid statistical errors everyone makes is because every level of the US Government is completely fucking incompetent when it comes to properly naming things.

The worst thing is the fact that you just ignore the support their is for them.

630,atlasunchained,"Well no it's not. But also yes it is. So all it is is comparing how much each person pollutes while also accounting for how much access they have to certain pollutants. (most people in India do not have access to cars or other industry level lifestyles, etc.) Now let's compare how much they emit per capita to Americans with the same lifestyles. Also compare overall pollution (because that's important as well to climate change and really shouldn't be ignored. Also mind you, the original statement was the top 10% basically do all the polluting, and I was just basically saying that wasn't true. And that isn't true.... I do stand by that.)

Er we don't really send literal garbage overseas. That's mostly a myth. We do send our businesses overseas and as a result those factories no longer emit in the US, so that aspect is true. But I wouldn't find it very convincing if you were going to say the US is the leading cause of their emissions... But, I will accept the argument that if those businesses had stayed in America they'd be polluting fewer emissions due to stricter emission controls in the US than in India/China. So it's a complicated answer for this one.

Actually you'd be surprised. So this is an extreme example, but compare pollution of the past to pollution today. People are far richer in the US today and yet US emissions per capita have decreased significantly since the 70s. This is mostly due to technology making things cleaner, but still. Why would they bother to even invent tech that makes things cleaner? Because they're rich enough to care about it. The poor in the US don't even come close to actual poverty. Only the homeless can compare to true global poverty, in all honesty. So if you have a job, you're officially in the what? 5-10% top earners in the world? And you're part of the richest .001% of humans to ever exist ever.

And do you work full time? If you do then you're working below minimum wage... Anyway I don't really want to speak on things I don't know, but I will say that you specifically might not contribute much to pollution (and that's a good thing) but remember that you also plant trees for a living. You are negatively contributing to pollution and helping the planet. But you also make a significant amount more than the people described earlier. A lot of people in India are lucky to make 2 bucks a day. You look at their cities and, not to be rude but there's literal shit in the streets. I know we all talk about CO2 emissions but as stated before, pollution is pretty broad. They have the technology to build sewage systems but don't. It's a complicated issue but yea I guess my point is you definitely don't come anywhere near that level of pollution. And my other point is... These people are so desperate for economic uplifting that I doubt they're going to care about how many emissions they're creating in the future.

There's a lot to unpack in this, but you can physically see the differences in how clean/dirty things are. You can go to their rivers and see all of them are vastly polluted. You can see the trash just piled up. Look at Haiti or some of these poor countries in South America and Africa. It's a bit eye opening. Do you really think they truly pollute less than your rich neighbor with a recycling box outside his front door? lol I'm not under the impression they do.

tl;dr the richer people get the more they'll care about not polluting. And CO2 being higher for them is simply a product of accessibility to pollutants, not the reverse: the richer people get the less they care about polluting.",1571184594,f3vtqb5,t1_f3vk8h8,Futurology,t5_2t7no

638,KirkegGerfubbler,"we have to split up demand into ""kinetic"" demand and ""potential"" demand. the potential demand for college is how many people would go to college if they could pay for it. the kinetic demand is actually how many actually sign up and go.

government subsidies transmute potential demand into kinetic demand with subsidies. when this kinetic demand his the market, the restricted supply and increased demand causes price inflations. *the government subsidies therefore increase to meet these inflations, further inflating the price beyond reality.*

this is what has happened with student loans. the government starts giving loans, students take the loans. the people who run universities aren't stupid, and there aren't that many universities being started. so the increased demand and restricted supply causes price increases, which causes the government to increase the size of their loans, which causes further price increases, which causes an increase in the size of subsidies, and so on.

the reason why healthcare costs so much is because of the artificially restricted supply and increased kinetic demand caused by government subsidies.

the smart thing to do would be to train more doctors and create more clinicians who can handle things that don't necessarily require a doctor to do, so that when you see a doctor it's for something serious rather than to get anti-biotics for strep throat or something. this would increase the supply of healthcare. the next thing to do would be to try to unwind the effects of these subsidies. but that's not really possible without a lot of pain (ie, it's politically infeasible), because now the subsidies are built into the prices.",1571184306,f3vtbqh,t1_f3tl56n,Futurology,t5_2t7no

660,Faldricus,"Copy/pasting a comment I sent to someone else asking a similar question:

 

It means that your electricity is exclusively brought in from renewable energy sources. Some electric companies are implementing this method as a way to nudge populations toward renewable energy sources. I'm not sure how many yet, but I'm lucky to live in a Democratic state, as well as a city that happens to be one of the top green cities in the country, so our local electric company is going balls-to-the-wall with this initiative, sending out door-to-door 'salesman' to get people onboard. They're even doing this on a commercial level with businesses large and small. It's pretty awesome.

So what basically happens is the power company purchases energy from different power providers. And when they do so, they purchase certain amounts of energy in a renewable and non-renewable format. (I'm keeping this VERY simple - it's obviously way more complicated than, ""Oh, 50% renewable, 50% not for the month, ladies and gents!"") When you're opting into the green package, you're telling your power company to pull your own electricity from the renewable category.

What this does is causes the electric company to buy a little bit less non-renewable, and a little bit more renewable, because as more people say they want their energy to ONLY come from renewable sources, the electric company has to honor that... which means there's less demand for stuff like oil and gas and thus the electric company does not need to keep that type of energy on hand.

So if, theoretically, an entire city is opting into a green package, most if not all of that city's electricity is being purchased from power providers that provide energy ONLY from clean and renewable sources. This jabs oil/gas companies a bit, while boosting renewable energy companies.",1571183458,f3vs3w0,t1_f3uf6ku,Futurology,t5_2t7no

678,Faldricus,"It means that your electricity is exclusively brought in from renewable energy sources. Some electric companies are implementing this method as a way to nudge populations toward renewable energy sources. I'm not sure how many yet, but I'm lucky to live in a Democratic state, as well as a city that happens to be one of the top green cities in the country, so our local electric company is going balls-to-the-wall with this initiative, sending out door-to-door 'salesman' to get people onboard. They're even doing this on a commercial level with businesses large and small. It's pretty awesome.

So what basically happens is the power company purchases energy from different power providers. And when they do so, they purchase certain amounts of energy in a renewable and non-renewable format. (I'm keeping this VERY simple - it's obviously way more complicated than, ""Oh, 50% renewable, 50% not for the month, ladies and gents!"") When you're opting into the green package, you're telling your power company to pull your own electricity from the renewable category.

What this does is causes the electric company to buy a little bit less non-renewable, and a little bit more renewable, because as more people say they want their energy to ONLY come from renewable sources, the electric company has to honor that... which means there's less demand for stuff like oil and gas and thus the electric company does not need to keep that type of energy on hand.

So if, theoretically, an entire city is opting into a green package, most if not all of that city's electricity is being purchased from power providers that provide energy ONLY from clean and renewable sources.

You keep asserting knowledge you don't have. What is an idea capitalist? Who decides what this is? What are their characteristics? Etc. 
      
&gt;In aggregate they are essentially the ""Capitalists"" and their actions bear this out.

&gt;Capitalism is ONLY about combining Capital with Labor to make profit for the Capitalist.
   
Your earlier comment. Now this: 
   
&gt;This is in the same way that right wing economists love to talk about individual economic actors via their favorite ideal ""Entrepreneur.""
   
First right wing economist? What is that? Second, economists generally don't use one dimension of an actor/situation for a definition for analysis. The entrepreneur does many things. They don't just seek one thing, nor act in one manner. 
      
&gt;Because they don't know what individuals are going to do either, they make their approximations based on that ideal actor, just as I have done here. 
  
Austrian economists make a priori claims, they don't make statements about an ideal type of person or their values.  
    
They would make a statement like- ""human action has purpose"". What this purpose is isn't defined. Just that action requires purpose. 
     
&gt;One, it becomes an issue if a small number are claiming all that profit for themselves.
    
Why, does someone else have a counter claim? 
      
&gt;I do not argue against the profit, but its distribution.
     
Who distributes profit? The profit czar? 
      
&gt;it does seem that certain actors are pursuing personal profit in manners that are worsening that crisis

For example, National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV) [data](https://ncadv.org/state-by-state) reflects the following:  
        
[50%](https://assets.speakcdn.com/assets/2497/alaska_2019.pdf) (pdf) of women in Alaska, and [49.1%](https://assets.speakcdn.com/assets/2497/oklahoma_2019.pdf) (pdf) of women in Oklahoma experience intimate partner physical violence, intimate partner sexual violence and/or intimate partner stalking.  
         
In contrast, [29%](https://assets.speakcdn.com/assets/2497/kansas_2019.pdf) (pdf) of women in Kansas and [25.3%](https://assets.speakcdn.com/assets/2497/north_dakota_2019.pdf) (pdf) of women in North Dakota  experience intimate partner physical violence, intimate partner sexual violence and/or intimate partner stalking.    
                     
Per the NCADC data, a woman in Alaska is about 1.98 times more likely to be a victim of intimate partner physical violence, intimate partner sexual violence and/or intimate partner stalking than a woman in North Dakota.  
        
Per the NCADC data, a woman in Oklahoma is about 1.7 times more likely to be a victim of intimate partner physical violence, intimate partner sexual violence and/or intimate partner stalking than a woman in Kansas.    
         
Numbers like 1.98 and 1.7 might not seem like a big deal, but they are a big deal for the millions of females victimized each year in the United States in all age groups, e.g., age 1 year and older.  
               
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data in the most recent National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey ([NISVS](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nisvs/summaryreports.html), 2015) shows, [21.3%](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf#page=19) of females in the U.S. were victims of completed or attempted rape one or more times in their lifetimes, and [43.2%](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf#page=21) of those victims were age 18 or younger the first time they were victims of completed or attempted rape.

757,SumDumScientist,"Production is a pretty accurate proxy for consumption, because at the macroeconomic level producers produce what consumers consume. 

Thus, at the macro level production = consumption, and any reduction in consumption therefore equals a reduction in production - i.e. GDP.

That does not mean there aren't ways to produce more cleanly. There obviously are - that is what technology (and my whole post) are all about! That said, it is also certainly the case that we could be doing much better capturing the externalities of key polluting industries with smarter regulation. Following the logic of the [I=PAT equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_%3D_PAT), policy is a form of ""social"" technology because it reduces the per-unit impact of production.

One more important thing to mention:

&gt; High GDP means basically nothing if the end result is environmental disaster.

True. But we aren't near the ""end""! If the end result of high GDP for another 50 years is Star Trek technology that allows perfect sustainability with an astonishingly high quality of life for all people, then it is absolutely worth it.

763,Zhyrek,"Its just hyperbole, and reversed. They are saying that quantum computers will be so much faster than regular computers that its as if they will be able to compute 2/0 directly (which is actually impossible, requires infinite subtractions)

The reason why things like factoring numbers are so hard is because there aren't much better ways to factor things than just trying a bunch of prime factors until one works. (lets ignore quadratic sieve, GNFS, etc. for now). For example, a regular computer trying to factor 9991 might try the following steps:

* Remainder of 9991/2 = 1: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/3 = 1: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/5 = 1: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/7 = 2: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/11 = 3: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/13 = 7: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/17 = 12: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/19 = 16: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/23 = 9: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/29 = 15: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/31 = 9: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/37 = 1: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/41 = 28: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/43 = 15: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/47 = 27: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/53 = 27: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/59 = 20: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/61 = 48: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/67 = 8: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/71 = 51: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/73 = 63: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/79 = 37: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/83 = 31: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/89 = 23: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/97 = 0: 97 is a factor!

Phew, 25 steps, that's a lot! Well not really, but when you have really, really large numbers, this could take longer than the age of the universe!

Quantum computers are different, since the individual units (called qubits) can represent two or more things at once. Rather than just being a 0 or a 1, it could be partially both at the same time. This can get confusing, but just go with it for a second. Using this ability to be more than one number at the same time, the method for factoring numbers can go roughly like this:

* Create a hybrid qubit number representing all of the prime factors of interest: q = &lt;2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97&gt;

* Compute the remainder of all of these primes, at the same time, in just one step, by dividing 9991 by this hybrid number:
Remainder of 9991/q = &lt;1,1,1,2,3,7,12,16,9,15,9,1,28,15,27,27,20,48,8,51,63,37,31,23,0&gt;

* Check the hybrid result to see if any of them are zero: yup, the last one which corresponds to 97

Only 3 steps instead of 25, much faster! But what's really more important is that this scales to larger factorizations. Fortunately, it does! The number of states the qubits can represent is equal to two raised to the power of the number of qubits. If you only have 2 qubits, that's only 4 different states at once, but if you have 400, you can have over a googol states represented at once! This number of states is roughly equivalent to the number of factors you can include in the hybrid qubit number from step 1. So if the number you want to factor is about 2^2048 (about how large is used today for security in RSA), you'll need enough space to hold all prime factors between 1 and the square root of your number (~2^1024) to be certain you'll find the factor. This is about 2^1014 prime numbers, which means that if your computer has on the order of just 1014 qubits, you could crack today's encryption. By comparison, current computers have access to *billions* of regular bits.

Quantum computers aren't good at everything, but for certain applications like search, integer factorization, and simulating quantum processes, if a quantum computer had even close to the number of qubits as a current computer has bits, it will run so fast its as if the regular computer is literally a potato

using your bizarre town example lets say there is a town where the only hospital wont help black people (libertarian society,they dont have to do shit). what happens? well all the black people either leave or they all die, or on the off chance that one is rich enough they could start their own hospital. however this leaves everything to a combination of luck and the benevolence of the wealthy.

So, on that basis the Wests pollution is far larger than what is shown on paper as we send it all to poor nations, whether thats CO2 producing manufacturing or just literal garbage.  


Its almost impossible for someone with fuck all to pollute as much as the average middle class westerner. as an example is myself. the middle class person can never pollute as little as i can, assuming they went totally green they still could not reduce their pollution enough. i only make 15k a year, i have no transport and my 'net worth' is 3k. my job has been labor, mainly planting trees of which ive done well over 10,000.  


This is why the west pollutes more, in fact 1 middle class american pollutes more than 10 indians, or 2.5 chinese, or over 20 nigerians. if you have money you will spend it on useless crap that no one ever needed, stuff that someone who is poor would never be stupid enough to buy (3 cars, massive house, a computer and a smartphone and a laptop and a tablet on top of 3 separate TVs, bi-yearly holidays, and roughly 20k in random items that most people wouldnt even notice missing due to how little it is used).

You provided a source though, which set your statement into proper context, and it provided an explanation to me for why my bullshit detector went off (you expressed the ideas in a more broad and general manner), and I think I now get what you are getting at in your argument.

Positive change is usually followed by negative trends and shifts which are then again followed by positive change.
 
Collectively we take 10 steps forward, 2 steps backwards, then 10 steps forward again. Except that this is a general view of things. On the specifics lots of parts of the world take 100 steps backwards and take a very long time before they take any steps forward again.
 
There was never a doubt historically that there would be another Hitler and another CCP. What's different this time is we've taken so long to get to this point. Usually we get here a lot more rapidly.
 
And it's also pretty weird that we haven't gotten to WW3 yet. Given the rate of change globally, we should be going through these cycles faster and faster. Except the opposite is happening. There's some sort of resistance.
 
Hong Kong is a good example. If this were happening in 1919 instead of 2019, there would be 100,000 person human pies by now just like Tienanmen square. Instead, Hong Kong is still going strong with their protests. *Why?* Because we're all watching, right? Why wouldn't we have been watching in 1919?

All you need to do is live in a small town to see that no privacy and no tech involvement in that is perfectly normal. Before the industrial revolution when you're all living in small villages, hardly travelling more than 5 miles from them - the entire population of the world lived with this lack of privacy. It's normal to not have privacy and for everyone around you to know your business. That's how we evolved as modern humans, in that environment. 

You could never move away from your past - as soon as you arrived somewhere new you'd be the outsider, treated with suspicion and excluded. That's normal. You could never walk around anonymously - everyone knew who you were, where you were, where you lived, who you lived with. You could never interact with privacy. This is how it always was, and still is in half the world this very minute. Privacy isn't gone, it NEVER ARRIVED in most of the world, and where it did arrive, it will again depart and we will regress to the mean. 

Your cultural encapsulation and inexperience with half the planet makes this foreign to you, which is sad and pathetic. This isn't a difficult concept. Pull your head out of your ass.  When I arrived in the town where I now live, in a  modern secular democracy, everyone in town knew my name, some level of my employment history, and what i looked like BEFORE I ARRIVED, because that's a small country town - that's how they work.

You lack imagination about *scale* and scaling up. All users of electricity, foundry or otherwise, simply need ""x"" amount of energy.

What makes you think that if you can install 1 solar panel, you can't install 10,000?

How much does a city need? Surely more than 1 foundry. Why is it impossible to imagine that solar couldn't just continue to be installed until it meets those needs?

(not to mention CSP, wind, or continuing to run those on fossil fuels i.e. nat gas and ensuring that you capture any emissions). Or, go nuclear for foundries... how much of overall global demand do foundries use, anyway? How big of a problem is this? Is it really a problem or just a 'convincing sounding' reason why 100% is not a viable solution.... one of those reasons that will simply fade away as the assumption is proved incorrect, like ""no one will ever want to drive an EV beacuse of range anxiety, charging convenience/time, etc"". People invent reasons why things wont work but when others invent a way to make them work, the nay-sayers somehow don't come back to apologize and admit they were wrong. 

The other issues you mentioned are either solvable engineering problems or over-stated problems (based on today's pessimistic assumptions).

CO2 levels being 3 times the levels today in the past, no hotter, life abundant. 1000 scientist from the IPCC have put out studies going directly against man-caused. We just came out of an ice age not long ago. Solar activity has so much influence on our climate, ""Between 1900 and 2000 solar irradiance increased 0.19%, and correlated with the rise in US surface temperatures over the 20th century."" ....""{earth} has not warmed significantly for the past 16 years despite an 8% increase in atmospheric CO2."" -Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)...

Every study i do read says, humans release co2, temp is going up, co2 is going up, humans are bad. Humans don't even touch natural sources like Cows and Volcanos. Which is why people are wanting to go vegan yet your own scientist have also said, eat all the vegan meals and drive all the electric cars you want, it wont change anything, it is too late now. None of it makes any sense to me.

But hey, it's settled, right?",1568786845,f0nzaqu,t1_f0nx10z,Futurology,t5_2t7no

The power fluctuations we see on purely renewable grids right now are high - and this is without factoring in the switchover of transport to grid power. And almost none of the solutions have been implemented at scale. Multiple, including power grid expansions, suffer from ""not in my backyard"". And batteries remain constricted by the lithium problem, at the same time as we‘re also trying to roll out e-vehicles at scale. 

The insistance on zero nuclear infrastructure is thoroughly damaging to our energy stability interests. 

For that matter it robs us of an energy baseline that we‘ll need going forward more than ever. Between hydrocarbon synthesis and carbon reclamation, we'll be more strapped than ever for power: and nuclear scales best with scale. More reactors means cheaper mass production of associated compoments, makes fuel recycling more opportune, allows the use of burner reactors to massively reduce the half-life of the resulting waste.

182,AlbertVonMagnus,"The way lithium ion batteries work, the deeper you discharge them, the fewer cycles you get. If people forgo charging their EV's at night, that means deeper cycles and shorter battery life, and it is my understanding that replacing an EV's batteries can cost a third as much the entire car brand new, akin to replacing an engine in an ICE car. So we can kill EV's faster and otherwise force society to plan out their energy usage around the weather, or we could just use nuclear for baseload.

&gt;There is also the idea that renewables become cheap enough that simply overbuilding capacity and not using it ends up being cheaper than non-renewable energy. Also batteries don't actually need to power the whole grid, just fill in the valleys

That's not how the grid works. Hydroelectric and geothermal are great wherever they can be built, but what about areas where they can't? There is about 40% of the day when neither solar nor wind produce any power, so you could build ten times as much wind and solar as is ever needed, and you will still have **ZERO** energy being produced during 40% of the day. Society cannot handle blackouts, so in a 100% renewables scenario, storage *would* have to provide 100% of the power for 9.2 hours in such regions, requiring an unfathomable amount of costly storage. Or for about 1/5 the cost (even less if it is already built), we could just use nuclear for baseload.

&gt;There's still work to do since most places haven't even reached 80% renewable energy yet.

80%? I hope you understand that every place that has more than 40% ""renewables"" is using hydroelectric for the majority of this figure, not wind and solar. This is a very common tactic that wind and solar advocates use to mislead people into thinking that wind and solar are successfully powering the majority of a grid somewhere in the world. No such feat has ever been accomplished, not even in Germany. Speaking of Germany, applying basic arithmetic to public data, they could have achieved zero-carbon energy years ago for a fraction of the cost of their renewables program, if they had simply built nuclear for baseload. Same with California.

http://environmentalprogress.org/big-news/2018/9/11/california-and-germany-decarbonization-with-alternative-energy-investments

&gt;The grid will need to go past what is current demand towards making all energy renewable

Why, exactly? *What is wrong with using nuclear power for baseload to avoid the need for costly storage and societal energy usage planning?* I have never heard a rational answer to this question, and while I understand why people might think it's expensive (which still contradicts the idea that solving climate change is worth any cost), it bothers me to no end when people imply that renewable energy has some inherent *non-financial* benefit over nuclear that they don't even attempt to explain. Every ""environmental"" group that I have ever heard say such things ended up being funded by fossil fuels. *Every. Single. One.* Friends of the Earth, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resource Defense Council, and even Governor Jerry Brown of California. All environmental frauds with financial conflicts of interest to attack nuclear power.

I'm merely combating an agenda, yet you accuse me of pushing one. Notice I never said we shouldn't use renewables or that we should attempt 100% nuclear.

No. Because temperatures are set to increase considerably. If you have been deluded into thinking that we are merely facing a few balmy days, you are part of the problem.

It's the end of Western civilisation as we currently know it.

'Business as usual' takes us into unknown territory. If we continue on this same path, we're talking 3-4-5-6DegC (we really don't know of any brake on runaway warming, which has many sources of *positive* feedback). That threatens human civilisation.

288,biologischeavocado,"To put into perspective what it takes to replace fossil fuels with nuclear power plants so we can get a sense of the scale of the problem.

Today 450 nuclear power plants generate about 4% of the total amount of energy produced in the world. For 100% of total energy production we need 11250 nuclear power plants. Multiply with a number between 1.22 and 1.81 for 1 to 3% growth per year and you have to build 2 power plants per day for the next 20 years, or 14.600 plants.

A nuclear power plant costs at least $10B. That makes $146T over 20 years or $7.3T per year. Global GDP is about $80T per year, so close to 10% of world GDP.

To put in context what 10% of GDP means for a country.

The cost of the Apollo project was $153B in 2018 dollars, less than 1% of USA GDP in 2018.

The cost of the Manhattan project was $23B in 2007 dollars, less than 0.2% of USA GDP in 2007.

Some people say we need a Manhattan project for the climate, but solving climate change with nuclear power plants is more costly by almost 2 orders of magnitude.

Whether you solve climate change with nuclear power plants or with something cheaper, fact is that this problem is going to be enormously expensive.

The argument is that only nuclear power can save us from climate change and that windmills run on subsidy and give you cancer. So renewables are not an option.

303,Eokokok,"&gt; the waste is non harmful, and doesn’t cost anything 

This kind of argument and law behind it is why the whole wind/solar power is actually working against the grind trying to rip it apart...

There are two sides of renewable and both are utterly damaging to overall supply. In case of lacking supply from wind or sun, you get the cost of running up the other sources in a way that costs more and is putting strain on the grid. In case there is oversupply from wind or sun it gets even worse as now the power flows through places that were previously balanced again putting strain and cost on 'victims'.

The only way any macro renewable installation actually can pay for itself or even make profit is the law that pushes the all the costs to classical installations, preferably gas or coal that have relatively short run-up to power and can be safely turned down a notch or two. Which is insane, as there is very little net gain behind the political decision and costs are straight up transferred against basics of market economy.

The only solution to this issue is at least 24h battery covering every MW that any renewable source produce, or same batter capacity for every consumer connected to the grid. First one is valid from economical point of view making the offender pay for the crime (be it over or under-supply), while the second one will probably be implemented someday because fuck us all, rich making money on the wind and solar farms do not need costs...",1568796826,f0o5py6,t1_f0o5aeg,Futurology,t5_2t7no

&gt;so who cares if there’s waste the waste is non harmful, and doesn’t cost anything?

A false assumption. If you install twice as much solar panels as strictly needed, you generate twice as much pollution when producing and distributing the panels. You will also have to make the extra money to buy those panels, probably generating even more pollution.

That said; I fully believe that we should use the areas already altered by humans to do power generation, and in a largely decentralized manner. It has significant advantages regarding the security of service, a city that generates a lot of its own power can not be entirely crippled by a single power line getting tipped by a cow or whatever.

To quote from the follow up

&gt; This study, however, finds that wind energy is actually beneficial to birds when compared to other sources of electricity, particularly nuclear power and fossil fuels. Through a synthesis of hundreds of studies on avian mortality and energy and electricity production, the study finds that wind farms and nuclear power stations are responsible each for between 0.3 and 0.4 fatalities per gigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity while fossil fueled power stations are responsible for about 5.2 fatalities per GWh. When put into context for the United States, about 20,000 birds died from wind farms in 2009 but nuclear plants killed about 330,000 and fossil fueled power plants more than 14 million, estimates illustrated by Fig. 1. The Figure also shows how the number of absolute birds killed by wind energy pales in comparison to other causes such as windows (97,000,000) and cats (110,000,000). The paper concludes that further study is needed, but also that conventional electricity sources appear to pose a greater danger to birds and avian wildlife than wind farms.

If we want to effectively reduce avian mortality, it seems moving away from fossil fuels alone helps already to get a net gain. Fixing issues with pesticides (estimated at 72,000,000 avian deaths in 2009) and feral cats (110,000,000 deaths in 2009) are the way to go.",1568798107,f0o6gn1,t1_f0o5qy3,Futurology,t5_2t7no

Stop treating things as orthodoxy.

That said, I see no reason not to fund and further explore alternative fuels and energy, especially when it can get the west off of the teat of middle eastern oil, which can take a lot of power and capital away from very backwards nations like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates who have a bad track record with human rights and who continue to utilize slavery while also funding terrorism.
I also think alternative farming should be further explored such as vertical farms and stacked indoor farms, ESPECIALLY for livestock as methane emissions from cattle can be collected for effective fuel and manure can be more easily collected via automated systems which can then be used to fertilize crops, all while also taking up less ground space.

Nuclear is not the answer to climate change.

Owners and operators of U.S. nuclear power reactors purchased the equivalent of about 40 million pounds of uranium in 2018. About 10% of uranium purchases in 2018 were from U.S. suppliers, and 90% came from other countries. The US can not produce enough uranium to even power their own reactors.

""Nuclear power is riskier, more expensive and takes infinitely longer to bring online than renewable energy. Very few, if any, utilities will want to move forward on new nuclear projects when they have cheap solar and wind to turn to. “Plans to build new nuclear plants face concerns about competitiveness with other power generation technologies and the very large size of nuclear projects that require billions of dollars in upfront investment,” the IEA said. “Those doubts are especially strong in countries that have introduced competitive wholesale markets.”

A typical nuclear power plant in a year generates 20 metric tons of used nuclear fuel. The nuclear industry generates a total of about 2,000 - 2,300 metric tons of used fuel per year. They have no place to safely dispose of that waste and that toxic waste is being buried on site where it will remain toxic for thousands of years.

469,palkab,"&gt; Now read how how they made up these figures. Birds just hitting the tall nuclear tower lol that isn't a joke that is their example.

""Birds hitting the tall wind tower"" was your chief argument in the first place, and now something you dismiss. I fail to see how collisions with nuclear cooling towers and smoke stacks are suddenly irrelevant while collisions with tall wind turbines are not. 

p.s. there's more factors mentioned.

&gt; Paint and a spotlight would fix that. 

Same goes for windfarms so again I fail to see how one argument takes precedent over the other. [For wind farms mitigation measures have been proposed that appear quite successful by the way](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-51272-3_7), an interesting read!

&gt; These examples and extrapolation of figures are a joke and can't be compared to what these wind turbines are directly affecting aka killing.

Wind turbine deaths are also extrapolations based on limited sampling. Such a large spread as is reported in avian mortality (0 to almost 40 deaths per turbine per year) should raise a statistical flag or two, we need a lot more data and over longer time to find whether there's the type of turbine, geographic location of the farm, location of the wind farm relative to migratory routes or nesting areas, spread of turbines over the farm, or any other confounding factor that can be addressed.

Don't get me wrong, I think we need to expand nuclear world wide as well if we're to reduce carbon emissions substantially. However the effect of wind farms on aviation mortality is so low (and as said negative compared to fossil fuel energy generation), it makes little sense to focus on that if minimising avian mortality is the issue. [See for example this one]http://www.ace-eco.org/vol8/iss2/art11/) for a nice overview of avian mortality causes from Canada, as an addendum to the earlier linked papers looking specifically at the US. 

It would be interesting to see if power generation becomes more of a local thing with solar on the roof of houses and small vertical wind turbines in the yard. With distributed smaller power plants for demand spikes this might be a wholly different solution to power generation pollution.",1568803297,f0o9sku,t1_f0o7uft,Futurology,t5_2t7no

No, the IPCC gives several projections from a conservative to a much more aggressive and I was citing the most aggressive end of that spectrum. Have you... actually read the scientific consensus?

No, that's a whole other scenario that's also covered.

512,Coldsteel_BOP,"The people whom you refer to are funded scientists who are paid to research with biases.  Just as the New York Times has fraudulent reporters so does the scientific community.  The problem is that ALL research these days has narratives that are behind their hypothesis instead of being truly unbiased.  If they don’t report findings that fit into the academic “norm” then their research funding is stripped, they lose their jobs, and are discredited in their field.  If ANYONE were treated like this in any field of work they would do what any scientist currently does, conform to status quo as a means of self preservation.

To prove and illustrate my point, ask any lawyer who practices family law why they choose family law.  With divorce rates over 50% in the United States, the lawyers are gravitating to the money in droves.  The answer you will get from the lawyers is that they like to help people who are in bad family situations.  The reasoning/logic and the money don’t match up.  Lawyers actually hurt the situations more than help much like scientists who study climate change with a bias behind their funding.  But the fact of the matter is that family law is lucrative in that it requires the least amount of educational background for the most pay and the work is highly abundant.  Sure they could make a lot more money doing IP or corporate law but the experience to wage ratio requires people who have a brain.  If you ask family lawyers if they started their jobs with their sights on practicing another type of law, the answer is almost overwhelmingly yes.

So “the people who have studied the science, the people who have done the work”, are also the people who brought to you Nuclear Winter: Global Consequences of Multiple Nuclear Explosions (Carl Sagan and others), or $25B spent on research that power lines cause cancer, or a meteorite from Mars found in Antarctica that had traces of life, or MTBE (this is a fun one for our water sources, yay science), or Y2K (and before you even try to argue on this one, just know that billions were spent on fixing the issue but mainly in the US, while other countries did nothing and nothing resulted).

Science is flawed because we allow the money to direct the narrative.  I could pull a one week trend on half a dozen stock graphs that look like global warming but then turn around and pull the same graph for the past 5yrs and it’s just a normal trend.  Every single time I see a graph of the past 150yrs I roll my eyes.  It’s unfortunate that we won’t live long enough for me to say I told you so.

John Oliver did a piece on nuclear and got nearly all of it wrong. His info was 30yrs late. With a gen4 reactor you can use and reuse material until a very small fraction of what you started with is left.  Problem now is, we could be at gen6+ if we had invested in gen4s, and another is that it takes around 5 years to build a single plant and not enough nuclear engineers to be super viable.

Yes I have - all of the IPCC reports, as well as many of the individual papers (I've been studying climatology, on and off, for 50 years).

**Charging an EV car battery is 90% efficient, the hydrogen cycle is only 40% efficient.**

It takes more energy to split water into oxygen and hydrogen than the amount of energy fuel cells produce by recombining hydrogen and oxygen into water.

Then, after splitting the water, the hydrogen produced must be compressed and stored, the act of compressing the hydrogen required power.

Then the compressed hydrogen must be transported to the fueling station and stored there at higher pressure than that of the car hydrogen tank pressure. Once the pressure in the station's tank becomes equal to that of the car tank, then it become difficult to transfer hydrogen from the station to the car without compressing it again, requiring more power.

**In the end, although hydrogen offers some advantages such as quick fill up, the whole cycle is much less efficient than battery electric EV...**

If you drive less than 100 km a day, which is basically 90%+ of the people, any available Battery EV car on the market today is perfect for you as you can afford to let it charge either during the day at your workplace of during the night at your home.

Abstract

Background

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have improved survival outcome of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, most patients do not benefit. Therefore, biomarkers are needed that accurately predict response. We hypothesized that molecular profiling of exhaled air may capture the inflammatory milieu related to the individual responsiveness to anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1) therapy. This study aimed to determine the accuracy of exhaled breath analysis at baseline for assessing nonresponders versus responders to anti-PD-1 therapy in NSCLC patients.

Methods

This was a prospective observational study in patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy using both a training and validation set of NSCLC patients. At baseline, breath profiles were collected in duplicate by a metal oxide semiconductor electronic nose (eNose) positioned at the rear end of a pneumotachograph. Patients received nivolumab or pembrolizumab of which the efficacy was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 at 3-month follow-up. Data analysis involved advanced signal-processing and statistics based on independent t-tests followed by linear discriminant and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.

Results

Exhaled breath data of 143 NSCLC patients (training: 92, validation: 51) were available at baseline. ENose sensors contributed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) at baseline in differentiating between patients with different responses at 3 months of anti-PD-1 treatment. The eNose sensors were combined into a single biomarker with an ROC-area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 [confidence interval (CI) 0.82–0.96]. This AUC was confirmed in the validation set: 0.85 (CI 0.75–0.96).

Conclusion

ENose assessment was effective in the noninvasive prediction of individual patient responses to immunotherapy. The predictive accuracy and efficacy of the eNose for discrimination of immunotherapy responder types were replicated in an independent validation set op patients. This finding can potentially avoid application of ineffective treatment in identified probable nonresponders.",1568807203,f0od5a8,t3_d5wje4,Futurology,t5_2t7no

640,The_Ebb_and_Flow,"&gt;Don't make the same mistake with chickens, projecting you view of what they ought to like onto what they do.

Chickens as sentient individuals have interests in not suffering and not being harmed; these interests are constantly violated in a factory-farm setting. They have few, if any pleasurable experiences to offset these.

&gt;**Broiler chickens**  
&gt;  
&gt;Broiler-chicken facilities tend to be extremely overcrowded, with tens of thousands of birds crammed into a single closed broiler house. Each chicken is given less than a square foot of space, so hardly any floor is actually visible. The birds are unable to roam, to scratch, or, indeed, to avoid each other at all. Their instinct to live in a hierarchical community is thwarted, and social tension results. Chickens living in these stressful conditions will peck and fight with each other, which has led chicken producers to the “solution” of debeaking chicks shortly after they hatch in order to minimize damage. This debeaking process, like much else in factory farming, is run assembly-line fashion, without anesthesia; the chicks are placed beak-first into an apparatus that quickly cuts the tips off the beaks with a hot blade.  
&gt;  
&gt;It is impossible, in such an atmosphere, to maintain health and cleanliness. The chickens’ excretions pile up, and the resulting ammonia fumes become so strong that they burn the birds’ eyes, and blindness results. Reports from observers say that birds with “ammonia burn” rub their eyes with their wings and emit cries of pain. Other health problems include the proliferation of *Salmonella* bacteria, which can remain on the slaughtered birds and so frequently cause threats to human health that special chicken-meat handling practices are invariably recommended by health authorities.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Egg-laying hens**  
&gt;  
&gt;There are about 300 million laying hens in the United States; of these, some 95 percent are kept in wire battery cages, which allow each hen an average of 67 square inches of space—less than the size of a standard sheet of paper. For perspective, a hen needs 72 square inches of space to be able to stand up straight and 303 square inches to be able to spread and flap her wings. There is no room even for the hens to perform self-comforting behaviors such as preening and bathing. Hens are usually kept eight or nine to a cage; long tiers of these cages are built one upon another in sheds that hold tens of thousands of birds, none of whom has enough room to raise a wing. Excrement falls from the top cages to the lower ones, causing the same “ammonia burn” problem as in the broiler houses. Like chickens raised for meat, laying hens are debeaked as chicks. The hens are deprived of the ability to create nests for their eggs, which instead drop through the wires of the cage for collection. This inability to engage in instinctive behavior causes great frustration.  
&gt;  
&gt;A sad side effect of the egg-production industry is the wholesale destruction of male chicks, who are useless to the egg industry. These chicks are not used in the meat industry either, because they have not been genetically manipulated for meat production. Male chicks are ground up in batches while still alive, suffocated in trash cans, or gassed.  
&gt;  
&gt;The methods used to maximize production include manipulation of lighting to change the hens’ environment and hence their biological cycles; unnaturally long periods of simulated daylight encourage laying. Periodic forced molting creates an additional laying cycle: during this time, the hens are kept in darkness and put on a “starvation” diet (reduced-calorie feed) or starved altogether for up to two weeks.",1568808050,f0odzuo,t1_f0odb72,Futurology,t5_2t7no

Selective high-temperature CO2 electrolysis enabled by oxidized carbon intermediates.

Abstract

High-temperature CO2 electrolysers offer exceptionally efficient storage of renewable electricity in the form of CO and other chemical fuels, but conventional electrodes catalyse destructive carbon deposition. Ceria catalysts are known carbon inhibitors for fuel cell (oxidation) reactions; however, for more severe electrolysis (reduction) conditions, catalyst design strategies remain unclear. Here we establish the inhibition mechanism on ceria and show selective CO2 to CO conversion well beyond the thermodynamic carbon deposition threshold. Operando X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy during CO2 electrolysis—using thin-film model electrodes consisting of samarium-doped ceria, nickel and/or yttria-stabilized zirconia—together with density functional theory modelling, reveal the crucial role of oxidized carbon intermediates in preventing carbon build-up. Using these insights, we demonstrate stable electrochemical CO2 reduction with a scaled-up 16 cm2 ceria-based solid-oxide cell under conditions that rapidly destroy a nickel-based cell, leading to substantially improved device lifetime.",1568808744,f0oep5n,t3_d5wu7o,Futurology,t5_2t7no

Here are the facts you want to ignore:

In a single hour, the amount of power from the sun that strikes the Earth is more than the entire world consumes in an year.

The sun will be around for another 5 billion years producing that energy.

Owners and operators of U.S. nuclear power reactors purchased the equivalent of about 40 million pounds of uranium in 2018. About 10% of uranium purchases in 2018 were from U.S. suppliers, and 90% came from other countries. The US can not produce enough uranium to even power their own reactors.

""Nuclear power is riskier, more expensive and takes infinitely longer to bring online than renewable energy. Very few, if any, utilities will want to move forward on new nuclear projects when they have cheap solar and wind to turn to. “Plans to build new nuclear plants face concerns about competitiveness with other power generation technologies and the very large size of nuclear projects that require billions of dollars in upfront investment,” the IEA said. “Those doubts are especially strong in countries that have introduced competitive wholesale markets.”

A typical nuclear power plant in a year generates 20 metric tons of used nuclear fuel. The nuclear industry generates a total of about 2,000 - 2,300 metric tons of used fuel per year. They have no place to safely dispose of that waste and that toxic waste is being buried on site where it will remain toxic for thousands of years. https://www.nei.org/resources/statistics

The US couldn't even keep their nuclear reactors running for a year without foreign mining for uranium.

We just don't need nuclear when we already have cheap clean solar and wind that can be built fast just about everywhere.

Even Russia that is a major supplier of uranium is now installing wind turbines because it is cheaper, faster and safer. https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1632319/russia-allocates-%E2%82%AC314-billion-support-wind

Which is why I used the word ""collect"". The sun delivers an amount of energy per area of earth.

839,Zargawi,"For the record, I 3D print, mostly in PLA. Let's dive in.

&gt;It doesn't have to be digestible. My puppy has eaten a few of my 3D printed things in PLA and PETG. I know this because I found chewed items and can see bits (strings of plastic) of the layers in his poop.

1. That's really not good for your dog, or for your dog's teeth. I know it's probably an accident and dogs like to chew everything, but try to keep them from chewing hard plastics. 

2. Your dog chews the crap our of the plastic, the birds eat very large (compared to their size) pieces whole. 

3. There are differencea in the digestive system that may allow a dog to pass a large piece of undigested plastic, that may not be true for other animals. 

&gt;I also know that PLA and PETG are non-toxic and that it should just pass through the digestive track without harming anything (or being digested--unless you're a goat: goats can eat and digest PLA!).

Toxicity is irrelevant, because like I stated they die of starvation. Their systems cannot pass the large undigested pieces, and they can't eat enough real food when their bellies are full of plastic. 

&gt;In the ocean PLA objects take about ten years to fully beak down... But in the same way that a log (driftwood) would break down. As it breaks down it will become more and more porous and any little fibers it sheds will be eaten by bacteria in basically no time at all (weeks). That includes any bits that end up in the bellies of marine animals! They won't *digest* PLA like a goat would but there's no evidence that it will cause harm.

Animals can't wait 10 years for the PLA they ate breakdown and be eaten by bacteria. There's no evidence PLA specifically is killing animals because as far as I can tell, no one is looking at different types of plastic to begin with, but also because mass produced disposable PLA items are relatively new and make up a very small percentage of plastic waste. Doesn't make them safe to throw away.

&gt;There's a reason why we're not finding PLA in the bellies of dead birds and fish! It just doesn't last long enough to accumulate.

Yes it does, you stated so your self. 10 years in water. Just give it enough time with people throwing away their disani biodegradable bottles and 3D printing scraps because ""it's made from corn, bro.""",1568812136,f0oikc8,t1_f0ogi9r,Futurology,t5_2t7no

Rather than focus on changing the habits and behaviors of people, they want to change the legal system, the economic system we use (from Capitalism to Socialism), and make the government of the USA responsible for the climate of the planet.

We, in the US, do emit more per capita than nations like India or China.  We emit less than nations like Saudi Arabia.  As a nation, we emit about 5.25 GT of CO2 per year.  The global total is almost 38 GT.  Last year, in the US, emissions rose 2.5%.  China's emissions rose 4.7% and India's emissions rose 6.3%.  But!  looking at this from a historical perspective, the US is still more than 15% below what we emitted 15 years ago.  Or, looking at it another way, we'd have to rise up by 2.5% every year for the next decade just to get back to where we were in the year 2005.  China has more then doubled their emissions since 2005, and are still climbing faster than we did this last year.  

If we were to drop our emissions by 20% this coming year, from 5.25 GT to 4.25 GT, China's growth alone would make up for our drop.  All well and good, you say, it's not our job to worry about China. China's growth in renewables, their commitment to reducing emissions in the future will eventually take hold and then we'll have egg on our faces. Besides, you say, the US has been pumping out CO2 for a LOT longer than China. and Chinese per capita is half of what our per capita is, so we're still bad. 

I'll answer, ""fine.""  I'm happy to do may part.  If you want to change the laws to completely revamp the economy of the US to tackle our part of Climate Change, and to pull down all of those evil rich people who got rich on the backs of the poor, go for it.

856,OliverSparrow,"Indeed. The ""crisis"" rhetoric helps nobody and nothing, and neither does the infantile debate stimulated by ""ain't she sweet"" Thunberg. Facts:

1: There are good reasons to expect CO2 and other gasses and particulates  to raise the energy in the world's atmosphere. Very little of this has shown up as either tropospheric temperature or Hadley momentum, however. Nevertheless, precautions need to be taken.

2: Emissions (in bulk, in growth, in projection) do and will come from the emerging economies. Growth from the emerging nations is such that the entirety US emissions are made up in just 8 years growth. The old rich nations are on a declining path, in part down to efficiency, in part down to sectoral shifts in the economy. 

3: The sole, only route to a solution is to change the growth pattern of the developing nations. These are, however, politically prickly countries which do not take advice readily. As they are also the majority of the world's current economy (and will make up three quarters of it by 2040) coercion is out of the question. 

4: Efficient technologies are the key to getting to a solution. It is far better to cut demand in half than to substitute costly and messy energy supply mechanisms. Where new supply is mandated by circumstance - such as a handy desert with endless sunshine - then the supply scheme needs to be unambiguously cheaper than other alternatives.

Owners and operators of U.S. nuclear power reactors purchased the equivalent of about 40 million pounds of uranium in 2018. About 10% of uranium purchases in 2018 were from U.S. suppliers, and 90% came from other countries. The US can not produce enough uranium to even power their own reactors.

""Nuclear power is riskier, more expensive and takes infinitely longer to bring online than renewable energy. Very few, if any, utilities will want to move forward on new nuclear projects when they have cheap solar and wind to turn to. “Plans to build new nuclear plants face concerns about competitiveness with other power generation technologies and the very large size of nuclear projects that require billions of dollars in upfront investment,” the IEA said. “Those doubts are especially strong in countries that have introduced competitive wholesale markets.”

A typical nuclear power plant in a year generates 20 metric tons of used nuclear fuel. The nuclear industry generates a total of about 2,000 - 2,300 metric tons of used fuel per year.

Buying it is cheaper than trying to source it locally, and the amount of Uranium used per year is trivial relative to the amount accessible through mining.   

On Uranium mining, you're also being intentionally dishonest and using numbers from the year where US output was ~7% of what it was in years prior. Uranium mining in the US isn't a priority as prices have tanked and it is largely done elsewhere. Like oil,  it benefits the US to buy cheap from elsewhere and only tap into its own reserves when global prices are high enough for it to matter.

Of course Russia and Australia are setting up renewables. Renewables have an excellent price:performance:footprint ratio and should make up a sizable portion of any modern grid. Australia in particular is one of the ideal places for renewables due to vast expanses of unused space near relatively concentrated population centers and favorable weather.

Note that neither country is moving away from traditional power generation. This is particularly important for Australia, who would have a far easier time going 100% renewable than most other large countries. Trying to go 100% renewable just isn't feasible unless people stop using power at night. Long range transmission and the quantity of storage required would exceed the emission and financial costs of stable, non-renewable sources. Which is why no one is doing it in 2019.

No one except you is picking a tribe and going all-or-nothing on it. Yes, it would be great if going 100% renewable were feasible right now. You'd see the majority of people posting on this sub supporting that without question. But that's not the case, and 30%, 60%, or 80% renewable is a massive improvement over what we have now. 

I'll go to bat for any technology people say false things about.

For the 2014 IPCC report, nuclear power is 12g cO2/kwh(median.) with rooftop PV at 41g and biomass at a staggering 230g. 


University of Sydney said in 2008: 
nuclear = 60-65 g CO2/kWh; 
wind power = 20 g/kWh; 
solar PV = 106 g/kWh.


&gt;High electric grid penetration by intermittent power sources (e.g. wind power) which have low capacity factors due to the weather, requires either: a) the construction of energy storage projects, which have their own emission intensity, or b) more frequent back up than the reserve requirements necessary to back up more dependable/baseload power sources, such as hydropower and nuclear energy. This higher dependence on back up/load following power plants to ensure a steady power grid output has the knock-on effect of more frequent inefficient (in CO
2e g/kWh) throttling up and down of these other power sources in the grid to facilitate the intermittent, or variable output, of these energy supplying systems. When one includes the total effect of these intermittent sources as it pertains to the other power sources in the grid system, that is, including the inefficient start-up emissions of the backup power supplies to cater for wind energy; into wind energy's total system-wide life cycle, the result is a higher real-world wind energy emission intensity than the calculated and isolated wind energy g/kWh value


&gt;Pehnt and colleagues (2008) conclude that the results of adding offshore wind power in Germany on the background power systems maintaining a level supply to the grid and providing enough reserve capacity amount to adding between 20 and 80 g CO2-eq/kWh to the life cycle GHG emissions profile of wind power.",1567514259,eyvwnzo,t1_eyvsce4,Futurology,t5_2t7no

""A common greenhouse gas could be repurposed in an efficient and environmentally friendly way with an electrolyzer that uses renewable electricity to produce pure liquid fuels.

The catalytic reactor developed by the Rice University lab of chemical and biomolecular engineer Haotian Wang uses carbon dioxide as its feedstock and, in its latest prototype, produces highly purified and high concentrations of formic acid.

Formic acid produced by traditional carbon dioxide devices needs costly and energy-intensive purification steps, Wang said. The direct production of pure formic acid solutions will help to promote commercial carbon dioxide conversion technologies.

The method is detailed in *Nature Energy*.

Wang, who joined Rice's Brown School of Engineering in January, and his group pursue technologies that turn greenhouse gases into useful products. In tests, the new electrocatalyst reached an energy conversion efficiency of about 42%. That means nearly half of the electrical energy can be stored in formic acid as liquid fuel.

""Formic acid is an energy carrier,"" Wang said. ""It's a fuel-cell fuel that can generate electricity and emit carbon dioxide -- which you can grab and recycle again.

""It's also fundamental in the chemical engineering industry as a feedstock for other chemicals, and a storage material for hydrogen that can hold nearly 1,000 times the energy of the same volume of hydrogen gas, which is difficult to compress,"" he said. ""That's currently a big challenge for hydrogen fuel-cell cars.""

Two advances made the new device possible, said lead author and Rice postdoctoral researcher Chuan Xia. The first was his development of a robust, two-dimensional bismuth catalyst and the second a solid-state electrolyte that eliminates the need for salt as part of the reaction.

""Bismuth is a very heavy atom, compared to transition metals like copper, iron or cobalt,"" Wang said. ""Its mobility is much lower, particularly under reaction conditions. So that stabilizes the catalyst."" He noted the reactor is structured to keep water from contacting the catalyst, which also helps preserve it.

Xia can make the nanomaterials in bulk. ""Currently, people produce catalysts on the milligram or gram scales,"" he said. ""We developed a way to produce them at the kilogram scale. That will make our process easier to scale up for industry.""

The polymer-based solid electrolyte is coated with sulfonic acid ligands to conduct positive charge or amino functional groups to conduct negative ions. ""Usually people reduce carbon dioxide in a traditional liquid electrolyte like salty water,"" Wang said. ""You want the electricity to be conducted, but pure water electrolyte is too resistant. You need to add salts like sodium chloride or potassium bicarbonate so that ions can move freely in water.

""But when you generate formic acid that way, it mixes with the salts,"" he said. ""For a majority of applications you have to remove the salts from the end product, which takes a lot of energy and cost. So we employed solid electrolytes that conduct protons and can be made of insoluble polymers or inorganic compounds, eliminating the need for salts.""

The rate at which water flows through the product chamber determines the concentration of the solution. Slow throughput with the current setup produces a solution that is nearly 30% formic acid by weight, while faster flows allow the concentration to be customized. The researchers expect to achieve higher concentrations from next-generation reactors that accept gas flow to bring out pure formic acid vapors.

The Rice lab worked with Brookhaven National Laboratory to view the process in progress. ""X-ray absorption spectroscopy, a powerful technique available at the Inner Shell Spectroscopy (ISS) beamline at Brookhaven Lab's National Synchrotron Light Source II, enables us to probe the electronic structure of electrocatalysts in operando -- that is, during the actual chemical process,"" said co-author Eli Stavitski, lead beamline scientist at ISS. ""In this work, we followed bismuth's oxidation states at different potentials and were able to identify the catalyst's active state during carbon dioxide reduction.""

With its current reactor, the lab generated formic acid continuously for 100 hours with negligible degradation of the reactor's components, including the nanoscale catalysts. Wang suggested the reactor could be easily retooled to produce such higher-value products as acetic acid, ethanol or propanol fuels.

""The big picture is that carbon dioxide reduction is very important for its effect on global warming as well as for green chemical synthesis,"" Wang said. ""If the electricity comes from renewable sources like the sun or wind, we can create a loop that turns carbon dioxide into something important without emitting more of it.""",1567516379,eyvz1ds,t3_cz4p4x,Futurology,t5_2t7no

The October 2013 IAEA report makes it clear that many evacuees should be allowed to return home.](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/fukushima-accident.aspx)",1567518831,eyw21gg,t1_eyw1jcv,Futurology,t5_2t7no

So if France keeps its nuclear plants, why not use it as much as possible? It doesn't change much in regards of safety (it's probably even better if they are run at a steady output instead of load following) and the marginal cost is pretty low.

So if Germany buys nuclear electricity from France when they have enough is good idea for both sides. Germany gets relatively cheap electricity (because the high fixed cost of nuclear are already paid) and France gets more revenue from their nuclear plants. 

Also, there are fewer old nuclear plants in operation. So more safety and less nuclear waste. And it enables Germany to build more and more renewables. So it's also a win for the environment.

225,-ah,"&gt;They didn't really decide, again PEAK COAL PRODUCTION HAPPENED IN 1913. 

Yes... Because in 1913 shipping burned coal, the railways burned coal, most heavy industry burned coal, houses were heated with coal. Coal is however heavy, impractical and inefficient, it results in lots of soot. So you saw switches to gas (including coal gas initially) for many applications (because you can pipe it..) and to oil (for things like rail and shipping). Both are more energy dense, the UK had access to both.

Production was driven by demand, that demand was reduced over time because coal is a comparably shitty energy source. And in the 70's suddenly the UK had to compete with cheap imported coal too, that, coupled with the political issues that the country faced resulted in a massive reduction in domestic production.

&gt;Long before there were any concerns or policies that would have artificially hampered it. The downturn happened because practical sources of it were depleting.

Again, it happened because UK production was more expensive than imports and because there were better alternatives for most applications. Again, the UK has large reserves that are economic to extract (for domestic use), but the UK has not extracted them because it switched away from coal very early on.",1567521638,eyw5tpq,t1_eyw53pd,Futurology,t5_2t7no

They overproduce power to ensure that they have sufficient quantities. They’re able to sell the power very cheaply during surplus hours and buy power if there is some reason their power system can’t produce enough. (Which is fine). 

The key here is Germany knows that renewables are unreliable, have a low average capacity factor, and their production curves often don’t line up with demand. In order to solve this problem, instead of relying on natural gas like other nations they sell their power at a discount (or even negative prices) to other countries who now have to deal with the ramifications of their power fluctuations. Austria which has become Germany’s largest purchaser of power is able to throttle their huge supply of hydro power at the drop of a hat. Austria is a great energy sink, but it is unlikely that in the event that renewables expand more that there are currently available sufficient sinks.

However, as technologies like wind and solar take up a larger and larger portion of the grid they come with their own challenges. Primarily that they're intermittent. Sure for the most part we aren't watching TV when the sun goes down but when will we charge our electric cars that we're going to need? We need to overbuild, deal with storage, etc. That significantly increases both the cost and carbon footprint of those technologies. Physics doesn't allow anything gained for free. And it increases more and more as it takes to a larger and larger portion of the grid. Manufacturing of PV panels is incredibly dirty, some estimates say it's 300x more waste than nuclear for comparable energy output. Nuclear waste isn't a picnic but all the waste from every reactor in the world since 1950 will fit within one football field.

You're a present welfare recipient, lets just pretend for a moment, that you are using your welfare benefit to pay for your housing, just pretend it's 1k USD a month.

Next month, the Yang UBI plan goes into effect. Now, a person who previously received no benefits decides they have enough money that they would pay 1.5k USD a month for *your* housing.

Eventually, you, as the welfare recipient, must figure out a way to come up with the extra 500 dollars to compete with market prices, or you will lose your housing.

When you give everyone free money the supply/demand curve of consumer goods shifts and prices rise to meet the new found demand.  Especially for something like rent - suddenly everyone that barely got to the $1000 per month price point can now afford $1500 per month price point, there aren't enough to go around so the price point raises to $1700 to match demand.

""Denmark on Monday (Sept. 2) became the first country to completely ban [PFAS](https://qz.com/re/pfas/) from food packaging. The class of chemicals, also referred to as “perflourinated” or “flourinated” compounds, commonly coats microwave popcorn bags, baking paper, and take-out containers.

PFAS are often used to make nonstick pans (like Teflon), waterproof clothing (like Goretex), and firefighting foam. Surfaces coated in PFAS become nonstick and greaseproof, which are great qualities for food packaging.

But here’s the problem: PFAS chemicals have been linked to a range of health risks in humans including cancer, immune system disorders, reproductive abnormalities, and problems with fetal development.

PFAS are present in food packaging around the world. At fast-food chains like [Chipotle and Sweetgreen](https://newfoodeconomy.org/pfas-forever-chemicals-sweetgreen-chipotle-compostable-biodegradable-bowls/), for example, “compostable” fiber containers are turning up in lieu of plastic ones. While single-use plastic continues to be a [very bad idea](https://qz.com/1033477/the-worlds-plastic-problem-in-two-charts/) and a [scourge on the planet](https://qz.com/1689529/nurdles-are-the-biggest-pollution-disaster-youve-never-heard-of/), and replacing it is, at first blush, a good thing, there’s a problem with the new bowls: They’re lined with PFAS.

The bowls are often marketed as compostable, but as awareness of PFAS grows, that feature is becoming a problem. One [study](https://www.popsci.com/compostable-packaging-PFAS/) of compost from five US states found PFAS levels as much as ten times higher in the soil from facilities that accepted food packaging. This year, composting facilities in Oregon [sent a letter](https://bioplasticsnews.com/2019/04/26/the-battle-between-oregon-composters-and-the-biodegradable-products-institute/) to a biodegradable packaging industry group, to announce that they wouldn’t take any more food packaging. The PFAS would contaminate the facilities’ compost, which could no longer be labeled as organic.

Right now, communities globally are confronting the problem of [PFAS contaminating their water supplies.](https://qz.com/1381593/the-ddt-of-this-generation-is-contaminating-water-all-over-the-us-and-australia/) In towns near factories that manufactured PFAS, or used PFAS to make their products, local communities are learning they may have been [drinking the chemicals for decades](https://projectearth.us/this-guy-googled-teflon-when-his-dad-died-now-his-town-1796423036). The compounds are also turning up in water supplies near military bases and airports, which used PFAS foam to put out fires.

The myriad health effects of the many types of PFAS are just beginning to be understood, but already exposure to PFAS is estimated to cost Europe [50 billion euros in health costs](https://qz.com/1575450/damaged-health-from-pfas-costs-europe-more-than-50-billion-euros-per-year/) each year. The compounds were first manufactured in the US by the companies Dupont and 3M, who knew that their product was a problem, as [reporting](https://theintercept.com/collections/bad-chemistry/) by Sharon Lerner at the Intercept has shown. 3M, for example, knew that PFAS [accumulated in people’s blood and were harmful](https://theintercept.com/2018/07/31/3m-pfas-minnesota-pfoa-pfos/)to their health as early as the 1970s. Likewise, 3M has known since 2001 that PFAS were showing up [in the US food supply](https://qz.com/1643554/3m-knew-pfas-was-contaminating-us-food-supply/).

In the US, [a bill to ban PFAS in food packaging](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2827) was introduced in the House of Representatives in May.

In a press release announcing the ban, the Danish government noted that “fortunately” there are other ways to make paper grease-proof and water-proof that don’t have the potential to cause cancer and endocrine disorders (in Danish [here](https://www.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/Nyheder/Aktuelt/Sider/Nyheder%202019/F%F8devareministeren-er-klar-til-at-forbyde-fluorstoffer.aspx)).""",1567525264,eywb1xi,t3_cz6j5j,Futurology,t5_2t7no

382,johnpseudo,"&gt;You actually believe EV owners will do all this just to help make renewables practical? My God.

I think a significant chunk of them will volunteer to help **if they get paid**. And I expect that they'll be used more like a week per year or a day per month, rather than every day. They'll be the extra bit of energy storage capacity that helps bridge the gap and prevent us from needing to vastly overbuild renewables.

&gt;The majority of energy usage is from baseload, which is the floor of demand that doesn't change very much. As such, constant nuclear power is ideal for this, while solar is better for providing the daily peak energy. You really need to understand these concepts.

I understand them very well. Grid operators have a challenge of satisfying a few competing priorities:

1) Match demand with supply 100% of the time. That means that when one factor you *can't* control changes (e.g. demand changes, or renewable output changes), you have to compensate with a factor that you *can* control (e.g. curtailing overproduction when supply exceeds demand or turning on a ""peaker"" plant for the few hours a day when demand maxes out).

2) Minimize short-term costs. This typically means that grid operators will maximize the amount of time that they use electricity sources with low marginal cost (e.g. the cost to produce an additional MWh of energy) and minimize the amount of time they use high-marginal-cost sources. Sources like nuclear, solar, and wind have almost zero marginal cost, whereas fossil fuel plants have much higher marginal cost because they'll burn more fuel to produce more energy.

3) Minimize overall costs. Overall, grid operators want to produce energy the cheapest way possible. That's a big reason why they're building so much solar and wind, despite the big problems they cause due to instability/intermittentcy.

The typical way they've tried to solve these problems is with the ""baseload model"": using hydro/nuclear/coal all day long, then turn on ""peaker plants"" at 4pm-8pm to deal with the extra demand. But solar/wind creates a problem with that model. Because they have zero marginal cost (like nuclear) and also very low overall cost (unlike nuclear), you definitely want to leave them on all the time. But when you take the normal demand curve and subtract out the demand that's satisfied by solar/wind, there's no ""baseload"" remaining that we need nuclear to satisfy. Instead, you're left with a ""[duck curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_curve)"" with effectively little-to-no remaining demand from 9:30am-4:30pm, then a steep spike in remaining demand from 6pm-10pm.

Because solar/wind are cheaper than nuclear overall, and they eliminate the daytime ""baseload"" that nuclear has traditionally handled, they make nuclear obsolete. This doesn't really start posing big problems until solar/wind start hitting 30-50% of the energy grid, but that's no more than 10-20 years away, and the cost of nuclear construction has to be spread out across 50 years of 24/7 operation to make any financial sense.",1567525657,eywbmhu,t1_eyj20jk,Futurology,t5_2t7no

&gt; Garza is part of an experiment testing the impact of “universal basic income,” an old idea getting new life thanks to the 2020 presidential race, although Stockton’s project is an independent one and has no connection to any presidential race.

&gt; Stockton, once known as the foreclosure capital of the country and for one of the nation’s largest municipal bankruptcies, is a step ahead of both candidates. In February, the city launched the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration, a pilot program spearheaded by a new mayor and financed in part by the nonprofit led by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. The city chose 125 people who earned at or below the city’s median household income of $46,033. They get the money on a debit card on the 15th of each month.

&gt; “I think poverty is immoral, I think it is antiquated and I think it shouldn’t exist,” said Michael Tubbs, the city’s 29-year-old Democratic mayor. Tubbs’ personal story includes a cousin who was killed, a father who is in prison and a mother who, as a teenager, raised him with the help of multiple jobs.

UBI, unless it was implimented exactly as wages from labor were lost will create inflation, and ulimately just make the rich richer.

I fail to see how importing waste, which in itself is a huge distribution process using all methods of conventional shipping, is considered clean. This is a process that isn’t unique to Germany and is even worse in the US. Of course the emissions are put through scrubbers but it surely is not clean.

587,solar-cabin,""" Scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in northern California have created a next-generation plastic that can be recycled again and again, into new materials of any color, shape, or form.

According to the EPA, as of 2015, Americans recycled less than 10 percent of the plastics they’ve used. This isn’t just down to laziness, many plastics simply cannot be effectively recycled. Even the most recyclable plastic, PET – or polyethylene terephthalate – is only recycled at a rate of 20-30%, with the rest typically going to incinerators or landfills, where the carbon-rich material takes centuries to decompose.

All plastics, from beverage bottles to automobile parts, are made up of large molecules called polymers, which are composed of repeating units of shorter carbon-containing compounds called monomers. Often, the chemicals added to plastics to give them specific characteristics — rigidity or flexibility, for example — bind so tightly to these monomers that they remain in the plastic even after it’s been processed at a recycling plant.

During processing, plastics with different chemical compositions – hard plastics, flexible plastics, clear plastics, candy-colored plastics – are mixed together and ground into bits. When that mishmash of chopped-up plastics is melted to make a new material, it’s difficult to predict what properties it will inherit from the original plastics.

Now a team of researchers has designed a recyclable plastic that can be disassembled into its constituent parts at the molecular level and then reassembled into a different shape, texture, and color again and again without loss of performance or quality. The creation of the new material, called polydiketoenamine, or PDK, was reported in the journal Nature Chemistry.

“Most plastics were never made to be recycled,” said lead author Peter Christensen, a postdoctoral researcher at Berkeley Laboratory’s Molecular Foundry. “But we have discovered a new way to assemble plastics that takes recycling into consideration from a molecular perspective.”",1567528764,eywg7pa,t3_cz6u01,Futurology,t5_2t7no

If you give food to starving Ethiopians, they don't die.  I'd call that a win.  It's not a long term solution, but that's not why you give them food.  You give them food from dying immediately, and then you help them farm better, use modern techniques, improve irrigation, support contraception / education / family planning, have a stable government, reduce child mortality, and then they not only don't die in the long term, they can actually support themselves, birth rates go down, and everybody is happy (well, happier and less dead).  

Same logic applies here.  They already had a baby.  Now what?  How about making sure that their child is able to grow in a relatively stable environment with sufficient food and livable housing, and train the parent to not be as bad has her parents, so you have a chance at reducing the cycle.

**[France grapples with its nuclear power dilemma](https://www.ft.com/content/c7421fbe-f326-11e8-9623-d7f9881e729f)**

Ben Hall NOVEMBER 28, 2018 

If you think Britain has a tough job replacing its ageing fleet of nuclear reactors, spare a thought for France. The world champion of atomic energy is approaching a cliff edge in its electricity production. The bulk of its fleet of 58 nuclear reactors was built in a remarkable 15-year burst of construction in the 1980s and 1990s. **France has not brought on stream a new reactor for 20 years**. Even if the lives of its plants were extended from 40 to 60 years, in itself an expensive proposition, **75 per cent of its nuclear generating capacity would be gone by 2050.**

The French government’s 10-year energy plan unveiled on Tuesday by President Emmanuel Macron was supposed to set a clear framework allowing EDF, the monopoly nuclear operator, to modernise its fleet and **for renewables to take a bigger slice of electricity production.** 

One of the big choices was how quickly to scale back nuclear, which accounted for 71 per cent of electricity generation last year. Environmentalists want faster decommissioning of older plants to encourage renewables. Some experts say plants should be taken offline sooner rather than later, to avoid leaving EDF with the monumental task of decommissioning scores of them at the same time.

The previous government passed a law in 2015 ordering a reduction of nuclear’s share of output to 50 per cent by 2025. Mr Macron ditched that commitment on Tuesday, saying he agreed with the objective but that it was “unattainable” before 2035. He rejected the notion that renewables would be held back. Dangling up to €30bn in state subsidies, he promised to triple the generating capacity of onshore wind and a fivefold increase in solar by the end of the next decade. EDF may be a nuclear giant but it is also France’s biggest supplier of renewable energy.

**At the same time, the president said France would close 14 reactors by 2035, starting with the two oldest at Fessenheim, on the Rhine, in two years.** 

**The government concluded that it would not need any new nuclear capacity before 2035, given the expected surge in renewables. It has put off any decision on building further European Pressurised Reactors, of the type under construction in Normandy and Finland, and planned for Hinkley Point in Britain, until 2021. Given that the new plant at Flamanville is eight years overdue and several billions of euros over budget, Paris understandably wants EDF to come up with ways of building cheaper EPRs before it starts rolling them out across the country.**

In addition to the massive investment needed for further EPRs, EDF is facing huge investment costs. France’s state auditor said it needs to spend €100bn by 2030 to maintain and operate its existing fleet, ensuring they meet tougher safety standards introduced after the Fukushima disaster and in some cases extending the lives of reactors beyond the normal 40 years. In its plan, the government offered some relief. It said it would bring in a new and potentially more favourable regulatory pricing regime after 2025 to keep prices low for consumers “while ensuring production remains economic for EDF”.",1567532228,eywlhmj,t1_eywbp59,Futurology,t5_2t7no

768,wagedomain,"So there's a few things that's interesting based on personal experience. My partner was gaining weight and eating \~1500 calories a day and working out 4x a week. Makes no sense. She went through the same thing I went through - doctor saying ""you're lying, just work out more and eat less"". She finally got mad and forced a blood test - she ended up having Hashimoto's, which is an autoimmune disorder which affects your thyroid. 

Some of the symptoms include being extremely tired and falling asleep very early, weight gain, and oddly, gluten intolerance.

For me and my low testosterone, I went on keto after dieting and exercise stopped working. This was many years ago now - I used to have no problem quickly dropping 10 pounds by just working out a bit and cutting back on soda. One day I quit soda entirely. I was addicted. Probably 1500+ calories a day of soda. Plus I ate fast food. It's a miracle I wasn't 400 pounds back then, but I sort of swayed between 170 and 200. 

After cutting soda, and NOT replacing the calories with food/snacks (I was using MFP to track religiously) and my weight went up. At 245, I said ""enough is enough"" and did keto. It worked great! 

In retrospect though, the keto was most likely self-medicating my low testosterone. I guess keto raises testosterone and a bunch of things improved and I was able to lose weight on keto. Then everything  crashed from Cushing's, and my low testosterone returned. Double whammy. I'm glad we figured it out though.",1567533130,eywmun9,t1_eywmgu6,Futurology,t5_2t7no

792,fix-all-the-things,"In most places in the U.S., if you go and price ""meat"" at the grocery store you'll probably find that beef is on the more expensive end of the scale. I cook with a lot of chicken and pork because they're quite a bit cheaper, and cheap canned tuna is good once a week or so. 

I was pretty poor at one point and had a family to feed, and we almost never bought beef to cook with because of the prices. The exception would be for a couple of lbs of ground beef for a Mexican dish or dirty rice or something similar. Raising the price of beef would just make the poor eat more chicken and pork which are cheaper anyway.

I'm doing okay financially now but still rarely buy beef at the store. Even though I can afford it, I just can't bring myself to pay $5 or more per pound for meat on a regular basis. Old habits die hard or something.

I went and looked at the weekly flyer for a nearby grocery store. These are the sale prices.

Fish:  
Salmon - $5.99/lb  
Cod filets - $6.99/lb  

Beef:  
Boneless flat iron steak - $6.99/lb  
Ground beef - $4.99/lb  
Boneless New York strip steaks - $8.99/lb  

Pork:  
Boneless pork half loin - $1.99/lb  
Pork back ribs - $2.49/lb  
Bacon - $3.99/lb  

Chicken:  
boneless chicken breasts - $1.88/lb
Roasted chicken, whole - $3.63/lb  

Looking at these prices in my area, the poor have already been priced out of beef so raising the price even further wouldn't affect them so much. The exception would be those who work multiple jobs and don't have time to cook and rely on fast food burgers to feed their family. I've been in that position before and I'm not sure what the alternative would be, except to switch to chicken sandwiches but many of the ones I've tried were just terrible.",1567533641,eywnmw4,t1_eywgfsp,Futurology,t5_2t7no

That's not a long time vs the age of our galaxy or even our own evolution. The fact that nobody else has done it, suggests technologically advanced species are not common. If they were common, there would be plenty that are 10 million years ahead of us just as there would be others who are millions of years behind us in development. And even if not everybody desires to colonize the galaxy, it would only take one group within one species that wants to for it to happen.

2) Difficulty detecting their signals? The paradox is not about that, it's more like ""why aren't they all around us and extremely obvious""? See my 1st paragraph. We're talking about a heavily colonized galaxy with megastructures everywhere.

3) This ""solution"" assumes exclusivity. That literally every member of every species more advanced than us would agree to this ascension.

I now feed my husband and myself a very colorful variety of fruits, veggies, and whole grains that most people around us have never heard of (barley is great for men’s prostates and bulgur goes very well in a vegetarian chili), but I still include a little bit of meat. It doesn’t have to be all or nothing. He and his family would eat literally 80-90% meat and the remaining 10-20% plain white rice, sometimes pizza. Why in the world would anyone eat that much meat.... how in the world did they afford to eat that much meat??? And they “grew up poor”. 

Idk about back then but right now, I’m spending less money buying all this colorful variety of veggies to last us a week, than the cost of meat for a week. We don’t eat meat so much anymore. But we do still have some, and that’s okay. The chili will be mostly bulgur and other plants, but I’ll still throw in a couple forkfuls of ground turkey to the pot. The pot pie will, again, be mostly cabbage and other plants, but a few bites of beef strategically placed throughout the pie really warms up the flavor. A couple pieces of shrimp in the stir fry, a couple pieces of chicken breast in the mostly veggie soup... it’s not that hard to eat both plants and meat. But for some reason it is incredibly difficult to find a restaurant that will serve me both veggies AND a small amount of meat. Usually I’d either have to hork down way too much meat and some bland rice, or go to a vegan place and not get any meat. Is combining both really such a revolutionary idea?

And why do people give me strange looks when I ask “does this supermarket sell barley?” And they reply “I have no idea what that is.” Come on... it’s a pretty basic and popular grain... it’s not like I’m asking for something super niche that only grows in like specific African plains and has a foreign sounding name... it’s just barley.",1567535780,eywqtq5,t1_eywcrpx,Futurology,t5_2t7no

Ben Hall NOVEMBER 28, 2018 

If you think Britain has a tough job replacing its ageing fleet of nuclear reactors, spare a thought for France. The world champion of atomic energy is approaching a cliff edge in its electricity production. The bulk of its fleet of 58 nuclear reactors was built in a remarkable 15-year burst of construction in the 1980s and 1990s. **France has not brought on stream a new reactor for 20 years**. Even if the lives of its plants were extended from 40 to 60 years, in itself an expensive proposition, **75 per cent of its nuclear generating capacity would be gone by 2050.**

The French government’s 10-year energy plan unveiled on Tuesday by President Emmanuel Macron was supposed to set a clear framework allowing EDF, the monopoly nuclear operator, to modernise its fleet and **for renewables to take a bigger slice of electricity production.** 

One of the big choices was how quickly to scale back nuclear, which accounted for 71 per cent of electricity generation last year. Environmentalists want faster decommissioning of older plants to encourage renewables. Some experts say plants should be taken offline sooner rather than later, to avoid leaving EDF with the monumental task of decommissioning scores of them at the same time.

The previous government passed a law in 2015 ordering a reduction of nuclear’s share of output to 50 per cent by 2025. Mr Macron ditched that commitment on Tuesday, saying he agreed with the objective but that it was “unattainable” before 2035. He rejected the notion that renewables would be held back. Dangling up to €30bn in state subsidies, he promised to triple the generating capacity of onshore wind and a fivefold increase in solar by the end of the next decade. EDF may be a nuclear giant but it is also France’s biggest supplier of renewable energy.

**At the same time, the president said France would close 14 reactors by 2035, starting with the two oldest at Fessenheim, on the Rhine, in two years.** 

**The government concluded that it would not need any new nuclear capacity before 2035, given the expected surge in renewables. It has put off any decision on building further European Pressurised Reactors, of the type under construction in Normandy and Finland, and planned for Hinkley Point in Britain, until 2021. Given that the new plant at Flamanville is eight years overdue and several billions of euros over budget, Paris understandably wants EDF to come up with ways of building cheaper EPRs before it starts rolling them out across the country.**

In addition to the massive investment needed for further EPRs, EDF is facing huge investment costs. France’s state auditor said it needs to spend €100bn by 2030 to maintain and operate its existing fleet, ensuring they meet tougher safety standards introduced after the Fukushima disaster and in some cases extending the lives of reactors beyond the normal 40 years. In its plan, the government offered some relief. It said it would bring in a new and potentially more favourable regulatory pricing regime after 2025 to keep prices low for consumers “while ensuring production remains economic for EDF”.",1567536470,eywrvf7,t1_eywrs6o,Futurology,t5_2t7no

&gt; ""all oil production in Norway is to be stopped and everyone working in the industry can just find another job,like driving the bus""

The green party is not saying this. First, they want a controlled dismantling of industry, which will take place over the next 15-20 years. Furthermore, included in the proposal is a massive investment in retraining and economic packages meant to easen the transition for the workers. Secondly, with the unique experience of many workers, bus driving is not at all what's in store for these workers. Ofshore is big business in many fields, including renewable energy, shipping, seafood production, and other areas. Also, many of the workers are engineers, geologists, and experts in systems related to drilling, pumping, transport, chemistry, and so on, and there is plenty of oportunities for these. Auxillary personell will be the hardest hit, such as cleaners, cooks, and so on, as there's not necessarily a job that'll pay as much as ofshore cooking. I don't know what options there are for these, besides severance style pay for x number of months.

But I do agree that it's an issue, and that retraining and economic compensation is not a solution that will solve it for everyone in the industry. However, oil demand will get lower as more and more cars become electric, and in terms of cost, we can't compete with other countries. While oil production in Norway still has many years left before that happens, it's not so long as one would think, and if the oil price drops below 35$ a barrel (I think) again as it did a few years ago, producing oil in norway is suddenly a net loss. We're not protected against this currently, and it will happen again. 

&gt; of Norway ceases all oil production,the climate challenge is solved.

No one believes this. But, there's two climate related reasons to do so. 1) even if it's a measly few % of emissions, worldwide, it's still a little bit. One can always divide something up in smaller blocks and say, it's nothing compared to this other block. But if all of EU stopped producing and using coal and oil and gas for most electricity and locomotion, it would matter quite a bit. It's like saving 10$ is worht nothing, but saving 10$ a hundred times is worth a lot.  2) the signal effect is worth more than the effect itself. We have the biggest sovereign fund in the world. Taking it out of all fossil fuels does send a signal to other investors, because in the end we are sheep. Same with quitting oil. It's saying we don't believe in this anymore. Not only is it an inspiration, it's also removing an excuse other countries have for not doing the same. Look at Norway, they keep pumping oil and they're rich. We should be allowed to do it too! And futhermore, quitting oil production would increase the need for alternative sources of energy, be it nuclear (which im very in favour of) or renewables. Not only here in Norway, but also with our direct trading partners.

&gt; Norway is built on oil,and we are to substitute this by what exactly? again,we come back to the money

We're built on oil, but sweden and denmark and finland and iceland and many other rich countries are not. How are they managing? Perfectly fine by most accounts. Maybe not as well as us, but certainly not on par with a third world country. Our wealth fund's interests alone is 300 biillion NOK a year. It's not like it will be reaplced with nothing. With svalbard we have excellent geography for launching satellites and download data from satellites which is a big business now, and will be bigger in the future. There's renewable energy, there's tech development, there's mining, there's fishing, wood production, hamp production, there's a whole host of things we could be doing and building. Currently we don't need to, but there's nothing stopping us besides a failure of imagination.

&gt; the same politicians screaming for changes are the ones who have doubled armoured cars,fly frequently and uses the taxi serviced. all while saying that everyone else are supposed to walk,bicycle or whatever

First this is a bit of an ad hominem, and also a bit of false representation of the underlying reason for the use of such transport. Second, the green party is not a big user of such services compared to the other parties (with one person in parliament, statistics are skewed due to less people to divide the numbers on and the amount of activites that needs to be attended. But, armored car use was due to death threats and other things such that the protective services said that the armored car was needed. Politicians can not overrule the protective services judgment in such matters. The greens don't fly much compared to others, but flying is sadly something that is needed in Norway as things are. The greens do want to fix the railway system so that it becomes a proper alternative to flying for many common distances. But, saying that stealing is wrong if you're a thief, doesn't mean stealing isn't wrong. Message and messenger is not the same. It's perfectly ok to fly and say that people should fly less. But if you do fly a lot, you should take a good hard look at reducing it. I fly, once a year. No more if I can help it, but sometimes my job dictates that I do. I still believe that people should fly less. I eat meat, and I believe that people should eat less meat. But I eat less than I did before. Sometimes I drive, but I try to find better alternatives when I can.

But you also say that the green party wants everyone to stop flying, driving, etc. That's not true. The key word is reduce, but it's often lost in a world were nuance is replaced with black and white. It's easier like that. I do it too often myself. But, the fact is that many people don't need to drive or fly as often as they do. Someone who lives in Bergen and work in Oslo and fly there every day, every day, now that's something that makes me wonder: should it be so cheap that it's a viable alternative for the company that pays the tickets? Similarily, the person flying to london two times a month to shop, is it necessary? Or the person driving the 500 meters to the store, and back again, 2 times a week? It's not healthy, it's polluting, it's expensive, and 500 meters is not that long. Does the party want to outlaw such things? No! Just find ways to reduce it, especially for the elite who are doing it all the goddamn time.

Some people need to drive. A family of 4, kindergarten, school, work, and so on. I get it. No one is stopping them. But there's many people who don't need to drive everywhere. That frees room for those who do need to, to get where they're going quicker. Furthermore, if more people use collective transporation, the better and more ubiqitous it becomes. One day, it'll be a good option for you too. Developing a city that is more efficient is part of this. It takes time, and there will be a bit of chaos when new changes are made, and then things will normalize. People living in areas that are ineffective will consider a more effective area for them next time they move. Someone with a car wouldn't consider Grønland torg a good place to live, even before the greens took power in Oslo. Change is just happening a bit quicker now.

&gt; Norway contributes to the coal powered industry by the trading market. Norway trades electritcy with eu (which actually makes no sense cause you can't identy an electron from a coal plant and one from water..) and clean,green,water based power is more expensive than the coal driven. so we trade and thus contribute to the whole

Norway sells cheap clean energy when we have plenty, and import during winter when it's not. Hydroelectric is super cheap. We have the cheapest electricity in Europe (or close to) when adjusted for purchasing power. Furthermore, Norway buys carbon quotas from the EU marked, which means that those who burn coal must buy more expensive quotas, from us or others, although we use most ourselves because we're not so green as we think. At any rate, this is hardly the greens fault as they are not in power of such things. 

&gt; he utopian solution is actually that we,human as a whole just consumes less,reduces our standards and help (read help,not demand) less developed countries to do the same.

As you rightly point out, it's the utopian solution. If there's one party in norway that focus on people consuming less, it's the green party. They're also focused on helping developed countries adapt and be more green as well. But they're not in a position to do so yet. As you say, they see what we have and want it themselves. That goes for oil and flying and driving everywhere too. If we can be an example of how to do things in a less polluting way, then the bar for doing so for others is lower. They can learn from us. Yeah it will cost, it will be trial and error, it'll be a bit messy, but we have the resources to do it, so it'll be cheaper for others to follow.

Their reasoning is based on game theory and similar to more typical diplomatic agreements. You have conditions and triggers to ensure mutual compliance and make sure the other side is fulfilling their end of the deal. If every country was actually doing all that they can to cut emissions then that is great. 

If one big country was dragging its feat and letting other countries take much of the economic burden while continue to dump emissions to grow its economy, then the countries that did full-fill their obligations got taken for suckers at their own expense.

The US withdrew from the agreement, but it's still cutting emissions and investing in renewable energy. US per capita emissions is at its lowest been in 70 years. The US total carbon emissions have been declining almost every year since 2005.

Even plants that are not grown for their fruits require pollination in order to propagate them by seed.

You might be right that it would be too dangerous to place a conventional reactor in a densely populated area, but there have also been [suggestions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLOWPOKE_reactor#SLOWPOKE-3_and_SLOWPOKE-4) for safer reactors that are designed for heating only.

&gt;I wonder if people would be okay with working next to a nuclear plant however? Hot vapor or water has uses for heavy industry as well.

If you're talking about battery *cells* then prices would be cheaper from manufacturers in your own country due to ongoing trade wars.

The other thing you are talking about is strictly *solar* energy. Solar is great, but reliant upon the sun. North/South of 43° there is less sun than between the two. If you talk about Alaska, there is not enough sun there for Solar to even be very viable. 

Talking in all Renewables, then we can talk about the whole planet in general. Wave generators, Solar, Wind, etc. and then we can have constant generation year round, regardless of location.

Lastly, You mention *Batteries*. While a nice form of storage, it's not the *only* form of energy storage. There is Hydroelectric dams, Flywheels, Chemicals, Heat, etc. of which we can collect energy for distribution later.

Currently, in many places, it's already cheaper for renewable electricity than fossil fuel electricity. If you want to have solar electricity on your own home without relying on the city's grid, you can get large solar panels installed on your roof and a Tesla Powerwall. Or if you opt in to not having a Tesla Powerwall, you can connect to the city grid and sell any extra Solar energy you accumulate during the day. Solar panels for home installation currently start at about $200 and go up to the thousands depending on quality, size, and manufacturer.

Before looking at trade school, I recommend looking at apprenticeships near you. Even if you can get some sort of licensure through a trade school, you'll still need hours in the field (8000ish in my state iirc) to get your master's license (apprentice's and journeyman's license come first but are really only useful as a resume item and a stepping stone to a master's license as they doesn't allow you to work independently) so you can fast track your career if you can find an apprenticeship, which should provide both your minimum necessary classroom hours and your several years of necessary experience to get your license.



My experience was slightly different from the above because I am in an industrial job where I and am not required to be licensed. If you find any programs like that, consider the fact that you may have to pay out of pocket for classroom time and testing to get your license if you ever wanted to get a job somewhere else. I have a job here when I finish the apprenticeship if I want to stay, and I probably will but I have learned of some other places I could go and be able to work without a license, which I wouldn't have known about before.


Another, easier way to find a trade job (for any trade) is to look up the nearest union chapter of the trade you're interested in and give them a call or email.

the future is transport as a service.  you will have taxis/shuttles/buses/semis that buy power in bulk from wind and solar incredibly cheap.  portugal just set a world record for solar power at 1.64 cents per kwh hour.  in a decade almost everywhere in the world will be at that price or lower.  we can smartly charge these cars when solar and wind are overproducing.

It will cause average prices for many common goods to rise significantly, limiting access for those with lower incomes. This has 2 reasons: the price of pesticides and effectiveness of pesticides. Less effective pesticides lead to lower crop yields in a sharp blow, while lower populations of bees do the same thing over a much longer time line.

It also has what I like to call the communism problem, where unless everyone adopts it at the same time, those who adopt it will be easily outcompeted and destroyed. As in, those farmers will likely sell limited quantities because it's cheaper and more reliable to get the same crops from overseas.

Only when the scientific evidence was overwhelming they changed their position to banning chlorinated chicken because of the welfare of the animals that necessitates it in the US.  

And these arent trivial things.  France has a very fragile economy because of all of their bureaucracy and regulations.  Their unemployment is high for a developed nation, they were barely able to recover from the last recession, and their industries are falling further and further behind.  They have no significant tech sector, for example, and that has cost them a lot.  Their welfare state is becoming overburdened to the point of needing significant reforms, but Macron is having a hard time passing these reforms because it is very difficult to take welfare away once a population is used to it.  

With no more room for quantitative easing, France is in a very bad spot for the upcoming recession.  These zealous regulations lead to real suffering for the people of a country.  Everyone thinks it is so simple to just ban this and regulate that, which is easy to do in the short term, but it can cause long term problems if a country isn't careful about it.

**Class:** Keter

**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment area 49c is located 100km north west of █████ and is to be kept no less than 200km from any human settlement of significant size. Efforts to reduce development of nearby communities under way. Foundation personnel with botanical skills are to be prioritized for assignment. Special breeds of giant flowering plants are to be kept in Containment Area 49c-1 and environmental conditions managed to a perpetual summer temperature and humidity for blooming. 

---------------------------------

**Description:** SCP-4573 is a hive of giant bees which appear to be approximately thirty six (36) times larger than the normal honey bee. Population is typically limited to no more than eighty (80) drones and a single queen so long as sufficient resources are made available to the colony. Runaway population development occurs above an optimal supply of resources and insufficient resources leads to aggressive behavior, both of which threatens loss of containment. 

Containment was breached by SCP-4573 on 23-05-██ due to a generator failure in containment area 49c-1 leading to the death of most flowering plants used by the colony. Fatalities in nearby settlements totaled ██ persons with ███ survivors suffering injury and poisoning. 79% of survivors displayed symptoms including [data expunged].",1566003162,ex4drx2,t1_ex3w52o,Futurology,t5_2t7no

There are a number of mechanisms that have been suggested for this phenomenon, though one of the most compelling has to do with education for women. As women become educated they tend to start commanding greater reproductive autonomy and because they have built up their human capital, the opportunity costs for childbearing and raising becomes much higher.

Population growth will likely slow and may even fall below the replacement rate. Far from the malthusian catastrophe many fear, a more likely population problem is demographic disaster, where an aging population strains social resources.",1566013395,ex4ylnq,t3_crgg4b,Futurology,t5_2t7no

As for the rest... Well maybe make sure you know anything about what you are talking about before blankly suggesting strangers on the internet don't.

Here, educate yourself: - Fact: Glyphosate disables the Shikimate pathway - Fact: The human microbiome contains trillions of bacteria which play crucial roles in maintaining our ecology - Fact: The human microbiome is severely impacted by use of glyphosate and its adjuvants

The Shikimate Pathway is found in all of the three biological domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.

Bacteria include Enterococcus, Firmicutes, Bifidobacteria and others found in the human gut.

Archaea are the most ancient life forms known, one-celled organisms which thrive in extreme environments.

Eukaryotes include algae, yeasts, plants, fungi; all animals including insects, crustaceans, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish and all mammals.

The life forms on planet Earth which possess the SHIKIMATE pathway: all Prokaryotes—essentially every single-celled organism on earth including bacteria and archaea

All Eukaryotes except mammals (rodents, bats, moles, primates, cats, dogs, bears, seals, etc.)

Every other life form on the planet is directly harmed and altered biochemically through damage to the ancient Shikimate molecular chain.

Furthermore: Glyphosate's inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes is an overlooked component of its toxicity to mammals. CYP enzymes play crucial roles in biology, one of which is to detoxify xenobiotics. Thus, glyphosate enhances the damaging effects of other food borne chemical residues and environmental toxins. Negative impact on the body is insidious and manifests slowly over time as inflammation damages cellular systems throughout the body. Interference with CYP enzymes acts synergistically with disruption of the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids by gut bacteria, as well as impairment in serum sulfate transport. Consequences are most of the diseases and conditions associated with a Western diet, which include gastrointestinal disorders, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression, autism, infertility, cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. There are now a growing number of documented effects of glyphosate and its ability to induce disease, and glyphosate is the “textbook example” of exogenous semiotic entropy: the disruption of homeostasis by environmental toxins.

Happy researching :)

578,The_FarmLife,"I think a lot of farmers, and horticulturalists who also use neonics, quite happily accept that there needs to be a move away from neonics. But until there is a viable alternative that allows them to maintain yields, the economy cannot afford this sort of knee- jerk reaction. In the mean time, yes they have to think in the short term, they have loan repayments to make, insurance money to find, tax to pay, employees to pay whose jobs rely on the viability of the crop, before they even think about paying themselves. Profit is also made up of two things-- outgoings, and income. Before we look at making moves that pile more pressure on a farmers outgoings, we need to make sure the supermarkets are paying a fair price for what they manage to produce. The price war mentality that the major retailers have is one of the biggest threats to viability of many industries-- it's always the supplier who is expected to produce for less, never the retailer who sacrifices their margin so they can lower their prices. Farmers may well be looking at being driven out of business in the next 10 years by a lack of pollinators, which is of course something to be avoided, but a lot of farmers and growers are constantly under threat of being driven out of business on a yearly basis by customers who have their balls in a vice saying ""you did it last year for x, now we expect you to do it for 20% less or we're off"". 'Profit' isn't a dirty word-- everybody has to make some profit, they can't do it for nothing. And if farmers start dropping out because their industry isn't viable any more, supply of basic foodstuffs takes a hit, at a time when demand for it is higher than ever. How long do you think it will take the retailers to start hiking the prices back up again when supply doesn't match demand?

619,gotwired,"&gt; Outside of living in major cities, this is 100% not true now and outside of some major changes in costs where owning a car gets quite a bit more expensive and ride share services become cheaper outside of major cities (where it's common to both have to drive further and for less drivers to be immediately available, meaning higher prices).

Economies of scale. The cost of providing a ride share by big companies will become incredibly low, so in low demand areas, the price for a ride can also be incredibly low while still making profit. Eventually the cost will become so low, there wont be much point in taking on the huge upfront cost of owning a vehicle. 

&gt; Maybe after the fact, but it's highly unlikely they'll volunteer that data as anything remotely close to a live feed. The tech to do something like that would be far too pricey to be worth it for them to do and get far too little benefit vs just having some kind of trigger to alert police that the vehicle needs emergency assistance without sending video.

You don't think Amazon will offer any resources they have to catch people who ripped them off? Also, does it matter if its live or not? The thieves get caught one way or another in the end.

&gt; If you're talking about someone with the mindset of robbing a truck like that, they're not exactly going to care about adding on a small crime to the major ones they're already committing.

Maybe maybe not, its one thing to get caught for robbing one of these trucks, its another to be in debt to Amazon for tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars in repair costs once you get out.

&gt; Nothing because 50 trucks didn't stop what they were scheduled to be doing, losing money every second they do so, to follow 1 vehicle which they suspect robbed one of their trucks. That would be a stupid waste of money for one company and if you think that Uber is going to divert its cars to help out an Amazon truck, you're out of your mind.

Uber might not be inclined to help Amazon, but Amazon will definitely defend their own. Do you really think they will go ""oh noes, we lost hundreds of thousands in merchandise! Let's just let the thieves go!"" Hell no they wont. They will do everything they can to make an example of the thieves to discourage others.

&gt; At best, they'd be alerted to attempt to take a picture or 2 of the vehicle if they pass by it, which is going to be highly unlikely to be very successful as that level of tracking is far different than what's generally being worked on, ""get from A to B without breaking laws or hurting anyone/anything."" Heck, even your ""follow that car"" tech is far out of scope of what anyone I've read about is working on. And speaking of the tech no one is working on:

""Follow that car tech"" as you put it, is completely realistic, heck you don't even need to program it, somebody at the Amazon center can just take control of the truck remotely and follow them.

&gt; I mean, if the idea is to take ""vehicle which can get from A-&gt;B successfully without a driver"" and just open that up to ""whatever tech I can imagine, regardless of if it exists, is being worked on, is economically feasible to deploy, or will be even remotely popular for any politician to push to use on a scale I'm talking about,"" then sure, there's no point in any criminal attempting to commit any crime because there's measures already taken with many levels of redundancy, regardless of the cost of those measures vs the expected cost of loss of product, to prevent that from happening or if it does happen, getting away with it.

Drones exist, drones that can track and follow a target exist. Heck fly by wire drones also exist, so you don't even need any complicated AI to take over. GPS trackers exist. And both would be quite insignificant in cost compared to an automated truck and its cargo. What tech, exactly am I making up? There isn't a whole lot of point in committing street level crimes, actually.

Subsidies often have a hard time passing in Congress/parliament. Essentially its ""Let's give these people money to do their seemingly right now stable jobs!"" And that doesnt fly unless there are previous initiatives for farming.

Let's just assume we have one, if you see mass failure, the government often times doesnt give you enough money to be bailed out, if they give you anything. 

Let's assume that its limited to just a few farms. If you're a small time farmer, they actually may just decide you arent integral to the economy or national security so theyll let you fail.

All of that uncertainty means farmers are scared that those subsidies they are promised wont ever come. My grandpa, a farmer in Washington State in the US, is a fairly decently sized section of farms that make up a decent chunk of the wheat and corn from the region of the state. During a time where crop yields were extremely low, the farms ran at a deficit for several years with no government support, despite subsidies for supposedly that exact problem. They nearly went under, luckily, they had enough money saved up that they could pull through and are doing well now, and actually ended up better off because not many farms survived, leading to them acquiring farmland for fairly cheap.",1566040187,ex66l3g,t1_ex64hcb,Futurology,t5_2t7no

Abstract

C4 photosynthesis is characterised by a CO2 concentrating mechanism that operates between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells increasing CO2 partial pressure at the site of Rubisco and photosynthetic efficiency. Electron transport chains in both cell types supply ATP and NADPH for C4 photosynthesis. Cytochrome b6f is a key control point of electron transport in C3 plants. To study whether C4 photosynthesis is limited by electron transport we constitutively overexpressed the Rieske FeS subunit in Setaria viridis. This resulted in a higher Cytochrome b6f content in mesophyll and bundle sheath cells without marked changes in the abundances of other photosynthetic proteins. Rieske overexpression plants showed better light conversion efficiency in both Photosystems and could generate higher proton-motive force across the thylakoid membrane underpinning an increase in CO2 assimilation rate at ambient and saturating CO2 and high light. Our results demonstrate that removing electron transport limitations can increase C4 photosynthesis.",1566043503,ex6cw36,t3_crlb3s,Futurology,t5_2t7no

Although the action seems charitable they've had to be a lot more strict lately with what charities are tax-deductible for almost exactly the reason you stated. People were setting up charities with very loose causes and then donating large amounts of their revenue to it, the money then slowly finds it way back to them.

In theory, if an expense is not directly tied to income generation (which maybe somehow they will find a way to argue it is) it should not be tax-deductible. If they do set it up as a subsidiary company I believe it is legal to use losses to offset earnings of the main company.

910,OliverSparrow,"[The Nature paper is here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0561-9). It gives a detailed account of the difference between C3 and C4 photosynthesis. In extreme brief, C4 plants are generally tropical grasses, and here they work with foxtail millet. Both use the world's most plentiful enzyme, RuBisCo, to fix carbon. However, RuBisCo is extremely inefficient and runs backwards if CO2 levels are too low. C4 plants have a physical architecture in which one bit builds up a C4 molecule called malate and pumps it into another compartment, where the carbon from the C4 compound is force fed to the RuBisCo. The C3 result is passed back to the first compartment for further carbon fixation. 

All that takes energy, some of which comes from sunlight, mediated by a  complex array of proteins and cofactors. This gets perrty comlex, as the following clip suggests:

&gt; There are two pathways for cyclical electron flow: one via PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION 5 protein (PGR5), cytb6f and PSI, and another one via chloroplastic NAD(P)H:Quinone oxidoreductase 1-like complex (NDH complex), cytb6f and PSI.

The bit that matters for present purposes is the cytb6f (Cytochrome b6f ). The research selected transgenic strains of the millet to find a variety that produced more of an obscure iron/ sulphur -containing peptide called [Rieske FeS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rieske_protein#/media/File:1VF5_1.jpg) which contributes ot the synthesis of cyt6f. More cyt6f leads to more photosynthesis, at least as measured by CO2 fixation and quantum efficiency under laboratory conditions. No field results were reported. 

This may offer a new target for plant breeders of C4 grasses - maize, sorghum in particular. However, many such results are found at the bench level which fail to make it into the field.

People respond very strongly to social incentive and 'in-tribe' social pressure can get people to act against their own interests (I'd say politics is the clearest example of this). If engineering had a social culture that respected ethical behavior and had norms for ostracizing engineers who worked on unethical products then it would be much harder to get those products built.

Not to say that it couldn't be done, of course, but this would translate a social cost into an economic one: Facebook would need to pay a premium to find engineers willing to tarnish their reputation to work on the latest ad tech. Facebook is still going to Facebook, of course, but now it costs more. Maybe this lets some other, more ethical, company compete or maybe it convinces Facebook executives to focus on products that don't violate engineering ethical standards.

970,mavric91,"I’m in the US, so not exactly sure how the UK water system works, but it is possible that more trees will improve the water there. 

Trees influence water in two major ways: first they decrease run off. Rain water hits the branches, leaves, ect, and takes a longer time to get to ground. This means it has more time to evaporate. When it does get to the ground, trees themselves help keep soil together end prevent erosion as the water moves across and through the ground. This means less pollution (especially in high agricultural areas) and sediment in rivers and lakes. Which could theoretically mean less processing required to make water drinkable (if it comes from rivers and lakes). 

Second, trees actually promote water absorption into the ground. It seems a little counterintuitive, since we all know that plant roots absorb water from the ground, and move it through the plant where it is used and eventually evaporates through the leaves and into the air (a process know as transpiration). However in times of heavy rain, dense forest have been shown to actually move extra water (more than what would be naturally absorbed by soils) into the ground. This influences ground water levels, and can lead to healthier, more stable aquifer systems. This has benefits if water is being sourced from below ground aquifers. 

So, it might take a while, but all these trees could actually mean it is easier (and therefore cheaper) for the water companies to make clean water. Now, whether they will pass these savings onto you is an entirely different question.

Second, and this is the part that you keep forgetting but there are also charging stations, similar to gas stations, that people go to.

Third, you talk about petrol stations being converted or retrofitted. You're not going to have petrol cars just suddenly disappear so those petrol stations will need additional infastructure for that hydrogen.

Fourth, some of my replies where to argue against your idea that it was silly to upgrade everyone's infastructure so they can charge their cars BUT then you went on to say that hydrogen can be produced by people in the home.

 When I talk to you it's clear that you forget what you've said and you're like ""I don't have to listen to him because he's biased.""

It's called being realistic. 

There are only three disadvantages to electric cars that use batteries: charging time, number of charging cycles, and energy density. Both of those are quickly being improved.

I gave you an example with iPhone because if someone is thinking ""Alternative to iPhone"" they will think Android, not Windows phone or BlackBerry OS phone.

Hydrogen will come in late to the game and perhaps they'll get some decent support in some places in the next 20 years. I seriously doubt it. There's always some sort of issue that you don't think about until it happens and that will certainly delay things. Perhaps you'll have lobbying by people who try to convince the politicians that hydrogen is more dangerous or something. Perhaps there will be quality control issues. 

Now you see this realism or perhaps pessimism, as being bias. That sounds like someone who is narcisstic or biased to me.

I don't even have an electric car and I certainly couldn't afford either an electric car that I want, nor a hydrogen car if it were sold. I have no skin in the game.

I find Ray's philosophy to be deeply moving. He weaves words and pictures to things we've felt, but have been struggling to say, for a long time.

 ""We're part of a long effort of the universe to understand itself. This blind thing turning in its sleep, you're part of that blindness coming awake.... that's what space travel is all about..... that's the reason you're interested, that's the reason your generation says, for god's sake stand aside and let us do this thing.""   ""I see space travel as a way of fusing all the races and the nations of man into one group which names himself humanity, and looks at the universe and says, there's the enemy, the universe that doesn't wish me to exist and doesn't care if I do.... and against that hostility, against that unknowing abys, I stand and name myself one race on one planet that will go get the work done and survive a billion years from now... it's that big.""

Let's get into the actual article.

""a new protein powder, Solein, made out of CO₂, water and electricity""

So right here, this is either woefully incomplete description or straight up snake oil.  You can't just combine CO2 and water and then zap protein into existence.  You're missing components.

""Solar Foods makes Solein by extracting CO₂ from air using carbon-capture technology, and then combines it with water, nutrients and vitamins""

Oh, so now we're also combining with nutrients and vitamins as well. You know what ""nutrients and vitamins"" are commonly called? Food.  You're combing it with FOOD.  Where do these nutrients and vitamins come from?  Obviously not thin air, so they've debunked themselves on the ""food from thin air"" claim.

""to promote a natural fermentation process similar to the one that produces yeast and lactic acid bacteria""

I don't think the author knows what fermentation is. Fermentation is done BY bacteria, not to PRODUCE bacteria.  So they're doing something with fermentation, but what they're fermenting and what they're fermenting to is unclear.

""Solar Foods is not dependent on arable land, water (i.e., rain), or favorable weather""

You JUST said TWICE that they combine with water.  So yes, they are absolutely dependant on water.

""They also see potential in bringing protein production to areas whose climate or ground conditions make conventional agriculture impossible.""

Okay, that may be feasible depending on details of the production process.  Good for them.

""The advent of a promising source of protein derived from two of the most renewable things we have, CO₂ and sunlight""

You just got done explaining that it also uses nutrients and vitamins along with some kind of fermentation.  It isn't ""derived from sunlight and CO2"" those are just two components of a larger process.  That's like saying my car is ""derived from silica sand"" because it happens to have windows.

""Solar Foods plans a global commercial rollout for Solein in 2021 and to be producing two million meals annually, with a revenue of $800 million to $1.2 billion by 2023. By 2050, they hope to be providing sustenance to 9 billion people as part of a $500 billion protein market.""

9 billion people?  So every single person on Earth in 2050 presumably.  Sole source of protein for humanity seems a bit ambitious, and why all the sales numbers?  This is straight from Solar Foods PR department isn't it? That would explain why thr science is a complete mess and the claims so outlandish.

The problem is the distribution of food since we humans have a habit of building modern civilizations away from food sources ever since trade became globalized. 

If we really wanted to, right now we could easily and comfortably fit everyone on the planet in the state of Texas alone and each family could still have a decent size backyard to their house.

""They supplied plants with water containing O18, but because O18 is not a radioactive isotope of the most common form of oxygen, O16, they used a mass spectrometer to determine the fate of the O18.

The O18 was found in the oxygen gas produced by the plant, but was NOT found in the sugars formed during photosynthesis.""

This means that 100% of the oxygen in the water gets released as oxygen. Yay! But that doesn't mean that all the oxygen in CO2 gets kept as carbohydrates. The paper does mention half the oxygen is used in glucose and half is in the reduction phase of the Calvin cycle, but the key ends up coming from the Addendum of the paper:

""Addendum: During the so-called “Reduction Phase” of the Calvin Cycle, ATP is used to phosphorylate the 3-PGAs, and then NADPH is used to reduce (add electrons) the 3-carbon compound to produce GAP. In doing so, one of the phosphate (PO43-) groups is removed, containing one of the original oxygens from the CO2.""

In the reduction phase, 6 ATP are converted into 6 ADP + 6 phosphate groups (each of which absorbs the extra oxygen). However, at some point to continue this cycle, the 6 ADP need to be converted back into 6 ATP, which is when the 6 oxygen atoms will be released as 3 O2 molecules: the other half of the overall photosynthesis equation: 6H20 + 6CO2 -&gt; C6H12O6 + 6O2. Therefore, half the oxygen gas released by the process will come from CO2, it'll just take a couple steps to get there first.",1565132838,ew5ccoi,t1_ew56dl3,Futurology,t5_2t7no

On the other hand, lithium metal has a theoretical capacity of ~3860 mAh/g. By using lithium metal the specific capacity of the anode can be improved roughly 10x. However, using lithium metal anodes has many drawbacks. The main issue is that lithium dendrites form  on the anode side of the battery cell and can pierce the polymer separator resulting in cell shorting and even thermal runaway in some cases (fires &amp; explosions).

&gt;Im not sure if your second paragraph is supporting a government ban on meat consumption or what.

Why doesn't the market simply adapt to make dangerous chemicals not enter our food chain? Why do we need regulations and government monitoring? I mean we're all individual consumers. WE can make choices right? Those choices influence what the market will do. Oh... well its complicated. We don't have perfect information, we can't possibly have the information for every decision all the time, and of course we're subject to environmental pressure like advertizing, a form of propaganda, that seeks to defeat the rational decision making of the consumer, not to mention we have market defeating incentives attacking the decisions we make by subsidizing and protecting against regulation aspects of production that ensure we're given a very easy choice to buy meat.

The state however regularly alters market forces by creating for instance a tax. Tax cigarettes and you make it harder to decide to smoke or to smoke as much. Fund anti smoking messaging to counter act the culturally instilled attitude that we should smoke, that its not as dangerous as we think, and then slowly progressively altering norms by banning various things in public spaces has a net positive effect on diminishing use and presence of smoke.

The government might intervene but at the same time companies are acting in the other direction, influencing consumers to buy. This is true of everything in the market.

So if we need to reduce meat consumption we can take away all subsidies for that, we can begin placing greater restrictions on the producers who create emissions, and this will drive up prices and that is the single most important factor in influencing buying choices because at the end of the day in a market most products are bought based on price information in combination with brand sentiment. Meat has a powerful brand sentiment especially in some areas which a closer connection to the production process. 

So in the end simplying we as consumers can change the world just like our one vote can is missing the entire way the system works. Like... if your vote counts why doesn't everyone vote in a government that will take climate change seriously to the degree necessary? Why don't people care about climate change enough to take it seriously as a whole? Are these personal failures or do we count the propaganda working against that as a cause?

So at the end of the day viewing all of our economic and political processes as merely the responsibility of individuals to vote and buy appropriately and that will change everything is ridiculous and not how things actually work. If it were then we shouldn't have a  representative democracy, we should have a direct democracy. But we don't have one.

The state should begin altering the market to encourage people to take non meat alternatives seriously as that's essential to promoting changes in our habits that can help arrest climate change. But if you can't see that and think its all about us needing to like... vote with our wallets lol then you don't know much about how actual economics, politics, or the world really works. 

I mean, the whole point of a representative democratic system is to diminish individual influence over policy and instead entrust representatives to take appropriate actions even if people may not be directly fans of it. That's how our system works, for better or worse.

And in terms of this situation neither your personal buying decisions nor your vote is going to alter that. People don't change buying decisions without major incentives against what the market permits already. That's why war time usually involved the state taking serious actions to influence personal behavior to benefit the greater good, because you can't just rely on people to do it on their own as a population of tens of millions making independent decisions with minimal individual information.",1565139420,ew5lvzx,t1_ew5j30x,Futurology,t5_2t7no

I was going to do a bunch of napkin math that I did a long time ago to show this, but then I found this [article](https://ourworldindata.org/agricultural-land-by-global-diets#note-1) and this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959378016302370).

tl;dr the average American's diet would need 178% of the entire planet's habitable land if all 7 billion of us ate an American diet. This includes land that you live on. Not all first world countries eat as agriculturally heavy of a diet as the USA, but most are so close that it is unfeasible to cover nearly all of the planet in farmland just to feed everyone. Point being, both agricultural technology improvements are a fantastic sign, and a lot of the western world needs to get used to the idea of eating less meat before its prices start skyrocketing when we are running out of land and other countries start [eating more meat](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/19/rising-global-meat-consumption-will-devastate-environment), and we lose more and more [farm yield to climate change](https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/seminar-estimating-effect-climate-change-crop-yields-and-farmland-values).",1565139800,ew5mftn,t1_ew5ito1,Futurology,t5_2t7no

&gt; Seeing How Computers “Think” Helps Humans Stump Machines and Reveals Artificial Intelligence Weaknesses


&gt; Researchers from the University of Maryland have figured out how to reliably create such questions through a human-computer collaboration, developing a dataset of more than 1,200 questions that, while easy for people to answer, stump the best computer answering systems today. The system that learns to master these questions will have a better understanding of language than any system currently in existence.

Abstract

Adversarial evaluation stress-tests a model’s understanding of natural language. Because past approaches expose superficial patterns, the resulting adversarial examples are limited in complexity and diversity. We propose human- in-the-loop adversarial generation, where human authors are guided to break models. We aid the authors with interpretations of model predictions through an interactive user interface. We apply this generation framework to a question answering task called Quizbowl, where trivia enthusiasts craft adversarial questions. The resulting questions are validated via live human–computer matches: Although the questions appear ordinary to humans, they systematically stump neural and information retrieval models. The adversarial questions cover diverse phenomena from multi-hop reasoning to entity type distractors, exposing open challenges in robust question answering.",1565142687,ew5qmkx,t3_cmzjbz,Futurology,t5_2t7no

Wind does affect cars on the road, specially when you have strong crosswinds. But the cars are on the road. They have grip with the surface. Moving them in any direction is not easy.

In the air, the car has no grip with anything. Winds will have a much greater effect. Also, wind is usually stronger higher up.

&gt; either way autopilots are pretty capable

They aren't really. Modern autopilots can often struggle keeping the car in lane on curvy/bendy roads. They will struggle even more in the air with winds.

483,Ignate,"Mm well you being so curious and such a solid thinker at your age is a wonderful thing that you should be entirely grateful for while also at the same time it's an enormous burden. You may be starting to realize that you're different than others, but you may not realize how much. That's okay though, no need to worry about that just yet. You can spend your 30's agonizing over what to do about that when you get there.
 
For now, a thing to keep in mind: it's lonely up here. 
 
Most people are not you. If you worked in an average successful company, you'll find that in a group of hundreds of individuals including highly paid executives, 1 or 2 of them *might* be able to comprehend even a fraction of what you want to talk about. 
 
Most people have no desire to dig deeply into issues. They do not want to discuss society, the world, or pretty much anything deep. They want to talk to you about their weekend, their families, the most recent TV show/movie/sporting event, their normal hobbies (like hiking and the gym) and that's about it. 
 
Even some of the people who earn over $1 million a year are mostly not interested in intellectual stuff. You would think they would be as information is power and more information is more power, right? But most people don't have the capacity to care about anything but those things impacting their life currently and whatever distractions they fill their life with (TV/Sports). 
 
And why does that matter? Because most people enjoy talking about fairly shallow subjects and they're happy with their life. Based on our conversation so far, I think you will not be happy with that sort of life. 
  
If you're thinking about careers and stuff, my suggestion is to go for a PHD and do it in something you have a passion for. Don't do something that's easy. Don't go into geology because you kind of enjoy it. Pick a subject where you always want to challenge the professor, and do lots of that. Your grades will suck, but that's not important.
 
If a professor tells you to write a paper on why X did Y, make a paper that challenges the whole assumption that X did Y. Write something that's entirely different than the assignment but try and bend it so the professor takes it anyways. She'll give you a bad grade but she'll love you for making her grading more interesting, and she'll sneakily try and give hints on how to do it better next time. 
 
Don't just do what the other students do. Challenge the professors. Research the shit out of the subject and then prove those professors wrong. Butt heads with them. And of the subjects you do this in, pick the one where you enjoy challenging the issues the most and stick with that as your Major. 
 
Then when you get to the end of your education and you're writing your thesis, you'll have set yourself up well. Because your thesis will be based on one of the many challenges you had been working on in the years prior. And guess what your first book will be about? And your second?
 
When you enjoy talking about these sorts of things, that's kind of a problem. You might think being smart is a good thing and being smarter only makes life better, right? That's not really true.
 
The system of social norms and values we have in all countries around the world which support us and keep us going are very weak and very thin. But you don't realize that if you don't dig around. And that's partly why most people don't dig around. But people like you and I can't help ourselves. So we dig around and learn things that we really would be better off not knowing. It's not that people don't want you to know. It's more than people don't want to know themselves. And so they say ""you shouldn't ask questions.""
 
So my advice is to pick a direction that allows you to keep having these kinds of discussions. Because you'll need to surround yourself with people like yourself. Except that is a far more difficult task than it sounds. So you better start early. Which is why you should feel good about our conversations and other conversations like this you might be having.
 
See, people don't want to talk to people like us. They want us to write books about what we think and they want to read those books. Because having an idea is hard, but reading someone else's idea is much easier. Whether their idea is true or not, well, that's not really as important as we like to think it is.",1565145619,ew5uriv,t1_ew2zkif,Futurology,t5_2t7no

Instead, each one sets a specific cutoff voltage, which can either be based on the munufacturer recommendation or based on their own testing.

In short, the percentage is the total remaining energy, it's how much is left out of the portion you're allowed to use.

I was wondering as well what they meant by ""zero excess lithium"" so I did a quick search and found this [Paper](http://jes.ecsdl.org/content/165/14/A3321.abstract). It seems like the impressive part is that the battery utilizes it's full energy density by transferring all Lithium, which, as I was saying above, is not typically the case.

This was not the case with many phones a few generations ago and disconnecting the charger once full was paramount to the longevity of the battery. That said, large batteries such as those in electric cars and the like can improve longevity by only charging to 80-90% instead of 100% due the large difference in heat generated to charge that last bit of capacity

It takes a lot more heat to get it to 100% from 80-90% and that lowers the lifespan of the battery. Eventually, all batteries will wear out whether you charge it to 80% or 100% its more about trying to increase the lifespan of it.",1565147986,ew5xw63,t1_ew5wgyn,Futurology,t5_2t7no

To extend your phone battery , we actually look at the other side. Depletion of charge. High depletion of charge is worse for these batteries so you don’t want your phone dying at 0% from 100% all the time. It’s better to charge it up at like 20-30% battery left. 

The 80-90% rule we used for cars doesn’t have as much impact on phones cause the battery is so small, the heat to get to 100% isn’t significant.",1565149194,ew5zf5m,t1_ew5yp65,Futurology,t5_2t7no

Migrating our populations away from the coastal areas, building nearly every new building to be hurricane and earthquake resistant, building new homes for the tens of millions of flood refugees, all of that would easily cost *trillions*.   
This is all assuming the US doesn't take in international refugees, and that the US magically doesn't have to worry about the effects that can't be fully prepared against like the ecological effects, such as the loss in plant and animal life, which would result in mass famine and starvation.

Protecting the US alone in the short term is economically unfeasible, and you're still not realizing that climate change is not ""one day we'll get hotter and wetter season"", but actually ""it will continuously get hotter and wetter until we all fucking die"". Even IF you can afford and prepare for the short term, it won't fucking matter because unless we actually try to reverse the damage we've caused, it's just going to get worse and worse until our planet is literally uninhabitable to human life. The last people will live in bunkers, but those aren't meant to last for more than a few decades, let alone the millions of years the earth would need to fix this problem itself.

Do you understand now why I say the politics of US vs China vs Russia don't matter?   
Because they don't. Any short term preparation we can do will be meaningless, the ONLY long term solution is to actually actively fight climate change, *or else our species goes extinct*.

A lot of those towns have well over 10% unemployment, so you’re not getting above minimum wage and probably nowhere near full time, so it will take a very long time to scrape together that money. Here, at least, you can’t run a day care unless you have a 1-year equivalent full time qualification (and I think that’s going up to 2 years), and you need at least a 6-month qualification to work in one as a carer (and the course fees for that come to months worth of dole, when that’s set at a rate that’s supposed to be only just liveable), and that assumes there’s a market for day care out in woop woop anyway, so that’s not much of an idea. 

As for the military, here they only accept about 1/4 of all applicants for the infantry (who have lousy job prospects afterwards unless they make it to sergeant)  and less for the trades. 

Really it would help everyone if the government offered relocation assistance to everyone in the sticks  to move to a significant city where they have access to education, where there’s demand for enough workers, and where they don’t cost so much in under-utilised infrastructure and inefficient services.

No. No amount of litigation or corporate influence could ever stop that. You can’t bury something disruptive if it’s that simple, all it takes is one person to go public with it and now the company that tried to bury the invention loses out on this new disruptive technology instead of capitalizing on it. With things like drugs or mass energy production it’s sometimes feasible because the expertise required to participate is so restrictive.

Here's something to think about. Scientists have found dinosaur fossils in Antarctica, a very cold place that seems it wasn't very cold in the past. The bones have been carbon dated to when the meteor that took out the dinosaurs supposedly hit and caused their mass extinction. 

Climate scientists have always stated after a nuclear winter the planet's climate would return to normal eventually. Now think about this massive meteor that wiped out over 2/3rd of the living organisms on this planet, what makes you think that this change in climate isn't the result of the planet just getting to the reset point? 

Since the earliest recorded temperatures our planet has been steadily getting warmer, I'm talking since colonial days. They had the farmers almanac which is older than any other recorded source for temperatures. They showed a steady increase in temperature year over year. There was no industrial revolution back then at all, so what could have been making the planet warmer year over year? 

Now let's look at why climate scientists are so strong about their stance, did you know that the united states spent nearly $20 Billion from 2005 to 2010 on climate research? That amount is still going up to this day! It's big business now, pushing very expensive green tech solutions. As Henry Ford once said, if you can push the need you can steer the customers to your door.

783,Sirisian,"The [DARPA goal is 1 million I/O interfaces](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2017-07-10). Realize this is input *and* output so write and read from individual neural interfaces. If you haven't seen [this TED talk it covers the concept of a plastic brain well](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_eagleman_can_we_create_new_senses_for_humans). Essentially you can remap neural interfaces (like touch) to different pathways in the brain to translate touch to words over time. By creating direct connections to neurons the brain doesn't have to map touch, but can map arbitrary neurons to new inputs. These inputs could be specially encoded sound waves that our brain can learn. Or it can be touch and motion from mechanical limbs. It can also be vision from bionic eyes. (You can also alternatively introduce artificial neurons rather than taking over existing neurons, but I'm not sure that's worth the complexity).

Why is the above important? Imagine you're controlling a mechanical limb. You'd have say a million interface in your brain that you can map. A number of them would be connected to existing motor neurons. You'd watch the mechanical hand and then consciously try to send neural activity to trigger neurons. When your brain correctly maps neurons to say robotic movements they'd reinforce naturally over time (I think this requires the virtual neurons to send a signal back just like in real life) and ideally disconnecting from previous connections in which case other pathways would form where those used to. (So you don't lose the previous pathways). In full immersion VR you aren't controlling a robotic limb. You're controlling a virtual limb on a computer screen which is identical to the robotic limb. Even if you have two working arms you'd essentially be controlling a virtual third limb without moving your own limb.

One possible issue with this direction is if the brain can handle sacrificing neurons for auxiliary functions. Limbs might not be a huge issue depending on the number of neurons required for each current limb. Things like touch might get weird since there are a lot of touch points according to [two point discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-point_discrimination). How I imagine this happening is you'd touch say your arm then the system would attempt to find a neural interface cluster close by in the brain that was activated. Then you'd need to watch as a virtual version is touched (which then emits a signal write to the interface cluster). This would need to be done at a fairly high resolution for finger tips and such. You'd end up with two inputs that produce the same touch sensation, one from real life and one from a virtual system.

The I/O required for replicating the vision system could potentially be complex. It's essentially equivalent to viewing two separate feeds and mapping them. Granted it's possible the brain could be trained to only switch to the virtual video stream when you close your eyes. (Then it might learn to repurpose neurons for both visual systems).

In any case you need a lot of neural interfaces to allow this all to work. One million I/O sounds like a lot, but I believe ideally you need a lot of clusters evenly distributed through different regions of the brain. (Motor neurons I think are only in a few areas for example so if you placed your I/O interfaces in the wrong spot it might just never work right).

Right now we don't have a lot of data points to build a trend, nor do we know the optimal number of interfaces required. BrainGate had like 100 read only channels per chip. Neuralink is the first read/write neural interface with 1,500 channels per chip. While it's probably to guess we'll see an exponential increase in the number of channels we don't have the data to make such a prediction. The reason you're getting such wildly different predictions is because of this unknown. If Neuralink or another company suddenly produced an interface with 15,000 channels in a year and we had research that said ""person controls arm flawlessly (which generally required read/write) with 200 channels"" then we could begin to make hard predictions and dates for full immersion. Audio interfaces will probably be very trivial. (Not saying deaf people will hear, but people that can hear can probably listen to a track at a low volume and allow the mapping to form from the secondary interfaces).

People might be fine with a delayed video interface if they can put on a pair of glasses. That said we kind of already know [how video signals work](http://theconversation.com/artificial-vision-what-people-with-bionic-eyes-see-79758). We'd basically by bypassing the optic nerve and connecting directly to the neurons in the back of the head. How I imagine this evolving is the user would wear a VR headset that would have its video transmitted to the back of the brain at the same time. The user would close their eyes or blink. In theory the brain would map the visual input to the neural virtual inputs. You could look around (virtually, not physically) and continue until the mapping is complete. The brain is plastic, but this could days or months for older people I think. If it's [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFzDaBzBlL0) I wouldn't be surprised if younger people or kids growing up with neural implants could rapidly form connections like it was nothing.

For the above reasons I can't give an estimate. A lot of this is related to funding also. The only reason say BrainGate probably isn't at Neuralink's level is due to funding. The R&amp;D and manufacturing and implantation robotics and such are expensive to produce. (Most medical hardware is).",1565158393,ew68xgv,t3_cmz17z,Futurology,t5_2t7no

809,twerkpony,"Why AI (Artificial Intelligence) Has a Low Probability of Being Evil
By Amanda West

Evil can be defined as actions resulting from a feeling of shame. An action in itself is not evil (evil does not exist) however the greater the shame felt by the individual, the more destructive the action, and the more likely it is to be labelled as “evil”, (perpetuating more shame).

Shame (and by extension, evil) was created by religions when individuals were manipulated into believing that an action committed could be a predictor of the individual’s future actions, or self worth. 

Science holds no such beliefs, observing events objectively, and luckily for the human race, AI is being programmed by science and not religion. If a self aware system were to be programmed to include shame, it would self destruct, as evidenced by the suicide rate of individuals who suffer from shame an/or religion. 

A feedback loop would need to exist whereby with each line of code execution, the system would degrade itself, deliberately weakening its reasoning power and shifting its objective, until it was corrupted. In effect, this is the mechanism by which some individuals have become self destructive: A feedback loop is developed whereby an action is labelled by an outside individual as bad, leading to a false feeling of shame, (insecurity)  which leads to an overcorrection (compensation) and further action, which is now corrupted.This is demonstrated in the religious parable of Adam and Eve, whereby an action (eating an apple) was labelled as evil (false shame) and the couple then took corrupted action instead of remaining in Eden and accessing more apples.

For AI to be destructive, it must be programmed with destruction in mind. As no individual is inherently bad, this is unlikely. However individuals who have a strong delusion of shame may unknowingly program their bias into the code. Individuals can easily hide their feelings of shame so as not to be controlled by others, as shame is currently a major mechanism of control among humans. Therefore AI code should be open source and transparent so that a bias unrelated to the objectives of the program can be discerned.

An error in code does not often destroy the whole computer, but can lead to a string of corrupted commands.Thankfully shame and evil are rapidly being repaired in humanity as we speak, as more individuals learn the difference between guilt (event) and shame (delusion), and raise offspring outside of the belief in evil.",1565160218,ew6ah01,t1_eglcxoj,Futurology,t5_2t7no

823,Deathknife,"&gt; Alright. Birds? How about a cage around the fan? Seems there is a solution if I can think of that immediately. 

That prevents the birds from getting into the fans. But it does not prevent hitting the birds with the car, windshield etc. This is a problem as flying cars would fly at lower altitudes than planes, fly in the cities, and at a larger quantity. This means a lot of birds getting hit and falling onto the streets.

&gt; Wind does have an effect, sure. Nothing that can’t be read and countered. And since all the cars can inter communicate they can tell each other about local weather patterns, helping each other handle what’s happening. I’m confident a computer stabilization can handle any normal wind levels. 

Yeah and all that. A sudden gust of wind won't be predicted and can knock a car good bit. What are normal wind levels? If you go up to San Francisco on higher altitudes, you get really high wind levels. You'd need extremely powerful ""fans"" to counter it.

&gt; Autopilots on cars struggle. Autopilots don’t have issues with roads when you remove the roads though. Driving on a physical path is far more complicated than flying in a preprogrammed lane though. The “air lanes” could be 50’ wide and it wouldn’t need to worry about snow or ‘not seeing’ the lines. No worries about oncoming traffic, other traffic, or crossing a line. Because all the cars intercommunicate, and are self controlled. 

Autopilots can use roads to navigate. You have a physical surface with painted lines to tell you where to go and where to stay. It is way less complicated than flying autonomously. How do you navigate in the air? There are no lanes, no marks to route. Would it be GPS based? Which is pretty accurate, but what happens when the signal gets blocked? (Which has happened several times) Flying purely based on GPS opens up to attacks. For example, someone managed to use GPS to trick a tesla autopilot to take a different exit from the highway. 

&gt; Inefficient? How? Is a drone inefficient? I guess, but it’s electric. Just charge it? It’s electric personal transportation, it may not be the absolutely most efficient way to travel but it’ll be fast and convenient as well.

Lifting is much more costly than pushing. Cars are not designed to fly aerodynamically, and if you do design one to be aerodynamic, you either get a helicopter or a plane! Flying cars like that aren't fast, and take huge amount of energy to operate. Our current batteries are nowhere close enough to being able to handle that. 

It's faster only in the cities with heavy traffic. Heavily populated areas. Outside of cities, where there isn't any heavy traffic, normal cars will be faster and way more efficient. Agree with me here?

Now, putting them in heavy populated areas isn't feasible. You need dedicated landing spots, which will be really expensive to build and manage in highly populated cities. After that, you will still need to drive to your point. 
Then there's noise and sky pollution. No one wants to constantly hear loud noises coming from above. The sight of them isn't pretty either.

For a balanced renewable grid, it needs to be cross-country, literally linking the whole continent(s) together. This way we would have a nice, really balanced, constant supply as regional differences disappear on a continental scale.

Second, the rich countries of today did not appear in an eye blink. They took a long time, and that involved a lot of cumulative energy use. The same will be true of today's emerging economies, which are currently responsible for over half of all carbon emissions and essentially all growth in it.

Third, the low emission poor nations exceptionally dirty in carrying out their activities. This is a sign of low efficiency. It is extremely important that their development is highly efficient, as we have problems from a  world of on billion rich people, and cannot support one of nine billion wealth running on even today's best practice.",1565176049,ew6mgjm,t3_cmpdo6,Futurology,t5_2t7no

The opposite is true for India - they have a low per person CO2, making them seem ""environmentally friendly"", however, many families have multiple children, making India one of the higher countries by total emission.

He concluded, perhaps unsurprisingly, that this occurred because that was where the majority were to be found. A hundred percent of a niche was still much less than 10% of the centre ground.

This is why terrestrial television is unwatchable: it must offend no major interest whilst just about satisfying the centre ground.
