0,nosoupforyou,"He suggests that self-driving taxis will lead to a single company running all them due to economies of scale.  He doesn't explain how, nor do I agree.   There are economies of scale in buying regular taxis now and hiring drivers, but there are still multiple taxi companies in NYC.

The biggest cause of big companies owning taxis there is the medallion issue.  At $1 million per medallion, it's hard for individuals to own their own taxi.

Most other cities do not require expensive medallions.  There is every reason to believe that every individual taxi owner could end up owning his own small fleet of taxis.   Instead of charging for his time driving, he only needs to charge for fuel, wear on the vehicle, and a small profit.

I do think it could happen that one company could crowd out everyone else.  The more cabs you own, the faster you make money and more cabs you can buy, until you saturate the market.  But this is true for chain restaurants too, and there is a limit to how fast anything can grow.

The taxi owner still has to maintain his vehicles, store unused vehicles unless he wants to pay for them to drive around constantly even during low usage periods.  He still has to fuel them, repair them, and handle both the paperwork for them and the work involved with assigning them to riders.  

Some of that can be done with a service, but it still will take him time.  The more cars he has, the more time he has to invest in them.  At some point he can hire additional help, but then his profit drops. 

So the only way to create a monopoly here would be to release hundreds of taxis in a city and either undercut everyone else or do it better than everyone else.  Undercutting by doing it cheaper will spread and won't last.  Undercutting by deliberately losing money could work but there is no guarantee that once you have the market and raise prices back up, that competition won't reappear.",1341776671,c5b5p11,t3_vxyn4,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2011

The other thing Google is slow to acknowledge is how often the car needs human help.  I saw a presentation from one of the designers, and on his 45 minute commute in the Google car he has to take over driving 8 times. From his map, it was pretty much anytime they got to a freeway interchange or ramp. 

The other thing they don't like discussing is how much data the car needs. It has to know EVERYTHING about the road: pavement markings, locations of signs, locations of trees and buildings, all kinds of stuff. Ever notice how on Google Streetview it blurs out the faces of signs or like a KFC? That's because their algorithms for figuring out if something is a person or a sign aren't that good. The Google car compares what it sees with what a data-collected vehicle saw a few days previous. Anything that's changed is cause for concern.

It's possible that gas pump attendants will be available to pump gas at every fuel station, since people might send their cars for a refill. 

In the same vein, if fully self-driving cars were to clear all legal hurdles there could be a huge re-arrangement of business services to cater toward loading people's cars with goods that they order online.

Have the car go get it while you play with your kids. Need to pick up your dry cleaning? Go send the car to do it while you're finishing up a business meeting, etc. If businesses are really able adjust toward that model then they could gain a competitive edge on competition.

 How much is your car actually used? 2 hours a day on average? That's 1/12 utilization. Car sharing car could double or treble that. Cabs usage rates are 15+ hours a day. Cut out labor costs and cabs become way cheaper, cheaper than owning your own cars. 

 Parking is a staggering waste of space, time and money. There are about 3 spaces for every car in America. There is an episode of the Planet Money Podcast about this. There is a related link from Planet Money [here](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/07/27/128791819/the-parking-revolution-begins) .

We can legislate how they use the data they collect. For example, don't sell it to third parties, only release it to authorities if there's a warrant.

The second step is basic V2V communication, where the helmet would tell the motorcyclist to turn one way or another to accommodate traffic.

Finally, if we scrap old traffic lights and intersections go computerized, Motorcycles could still participate if the cyclist has a HUD that clearly communicates the exact time and path through the intersection, and automatically accelerates/brakes to guide the motorcycle accordingly.  In fact, it could even black out irrelevant data as in star wars IV when Skywalker uses his communicator to just look at the path he's flying (and ignores the actual visual, which includes other stuff that he could crash into but won't because the autopilot automatically avoids them).

48,ronsta,"These are usually the misgivings you hear from naysayers when we are on the cusp of a revolutionary new technology. In the near term, the issue of accidents and moving violations could be solved by changing auto insurance policies to have personal liability as one portion, and auto manufacturer liability as another. Perhaps the manufacturer of the car carries the initial burden and passes it on to the consumer via a tax applied to the car purchase or conversion. This is in the event of self-driving cars owned by consumers.

However, as many have noted, the creation of completely automated, self-driving cars will begin to negate the need for an ""owned car."" Think of these cars as providing a taxi service rather than being an owned asset. I have an app on my phone and tell it I need a pickup at XYZ address in 5 minutes, it tells me the name/number of the car and shows it to me on my phone GPS. When I step into the car, I'm automatically charged for the time (or the minutes/miles are reduced from my monthly service). I also pay a tax for the possibility of any accidents with vehicles, stationary objects or people that may occur during my ride. Perhaps that's a $.25 tax at first, and as volume of rides go up, the tech becomes safer and person-driven cars become almost obsolete, the amount of this tax goes down. That tax would be more than enough to pay for accidents caused by the automated car. 

The more interesting question is what happens to roads, traffic lights and street signs once this technology is completely ubiquitous? If 95% of the population is using automated cars, do we even need directional street signs anymore? Do we need yield signs? Speed signs? If we ever truly get to 100%, we can do away with traffic lights, stop signs. The cars would have all of this information programmed in or read it on the fly from other cars or the server. They would know about traffic issues -- similar to Waze -- from reading how quickly their peer cars are moving. Hell, we can do away with lanes and cars can be constructed with smaller or non-existent driver consoles.  

All of these advancements would reduce the number of accidents. In due time, the technology would be so safe, that accidents would be extremely rare...to the point where the issue of who will assume the cost/risk for accidents will be an afterthought and handled by the per-ride tax.

58,Awkward_moments,"I think they will. But if we talking any real large increase in size, great rail service is a must. The london tube is fucking amazing. But it can still be massively improved. 

Like for example I think there might be sub cities to large cities. So you would get in a self driving go to the (sub) city center. This sub city has some small shops, hospital, police station ect. But not enough to support the population. The most important thing it got is a high speed regular train into the big city where all the jobs are. When you get to be big city you take the tube. Then you walk most likely, too many people to drive.

To me that sounds like hell, I hate london as it is. But i think this will happen. It probably happens to an extent but its not efficient enough.

I think self driving cars will allow for travel around large cities (and obviously everything smaller), but not super large cities like london or greater. The self driving car will reduce the population density and people will rather live an hour away and have a self driving car than live 30 mins away and drive manually. Adding to this if you live an hour away you get more land and a bigger house for the same price. So its a reason to move out of the cities.

The density of megacities will increase, self driving cars wont directly affect the centers i dont think. But there is a magic density outside this where car parks are still really profitable and easy to get to. These will be replaced as they wont be needed (as much) and the roads will hold more cars.",1378240202,cc131al,t3_1llske,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2013

It would also be great for moving fully charged cars out of charging spots and into regular spots. All too often people just leave their cars parked in charging stations all day even if the charge completed in just a few hours.

60,fricken,"I just posted this in another thread, if you bear with the boring preamble, you'll see that it's roughly on-topic:

People have been tinkering with the idea of autobots since the 1930s. Nobody has been in a rush to implement them until Google came along and demonstrated that they are serious. A year ago most major automakers were only interested in bringing autonomous features to cars as expensive upgrades but they've since come around to the realization that fully-autonomous vehicles could virtually wipe out the paradigm of personal vehicle ownership that has prevailed for the last 100 years, and is a legitimate threat to their business model.

In emerging markets there is no established car-culture, they'll go straight to robotaxis, the same way many have gone straight to smartphones without ever owning a landline or a personal computer.

Self-driving cars aren't *just cars*, if you exclude the roomba, they mark the beginning of a revolution in robotics, in which robots are entrusted with great responsibility while living and working amongst us in dynamic, chaotic real-world environments.

Once that rubicon has been crossed there's no turning back. If you can teach one car to drive like Mario Andretti, you've taught them all.
In as much as consumer demand is incentivizing companies to invest millions in achieving marginal gains in processing power and efficiency with computer chips, big money will drive companies at the forefront of autonomous vehicles to devise machines that can reliably perform the ever more complex tasks needed to break into fresh markets that go beyond just driving around.

It starts with them chauffeuring, and shipping goods, but from there it's a series of small, incremental steps to mowing lawns, collecting garbage, sweeping streets, washing windows, mining, agriculture, digging and bulldozing, demolition, road construction, erecting homes... and so on.

And this will happen pretty fast. You may be skeptical, but consider that it took about 15 years for cellphones to go from their limited capabilities as glorified walky-talkies to being the almost magical devices we take for granted now, and we can expect a similar progression and timeline for the foundational technology that makes self-driving cars possible to start moving into sci-fi territory once that industry gets up and running on a global scale, which it invariably will.

While your phone has seemingly taken on a final form factor as this swiss army knife of electronic gizmos that replaces tens of thousands of dollars worth of crap available 15 years ago, we will come around to having a household robot that *just does* everything. For those who still have real jobs, at least, I think it will be affordable.

61,fricken,"From the article:

&gt;Google may well be considering all possibilities, but I think it’s quite unlikely it will attempt to build its own cars. That would be a colossal undertaking, even for such an ambitious company; and it’s experience with electronics hardware hardly seems like sufficient preparation for a leap into the immensely complex and high-risk world of automotive manufacturing.
&gt;

This is from Jessica Ellin's [scoop](http://jessicalessin.com/2013/08/23/exclusive-google-designing-its-own-self-driving-car-considers-robo-taxi-2/):

&gt;Google Inc., which has been working on software to help major automakers build self-driving cars, also is quietly going around them by designing and developing a full-fledged self-driving car, according to people familiar with the matter.

She's a reputable journalist I don't think she or her source is bullshitting. It does seem tremendously unlikely that Google would be able to manufacture it's own cars, and it's even more unlikely that they'll be able to do it within the 4 or 5 year time frame that Brin has previously suggested before their product is ready for market. 

But what if Google *isn't* interested in making something like a self-driving prius, as you might imagine? What if they're interested in manufacturing something stripped down, no-frills, slow moving, and dirt cheap, specialized for robotaxis in dense urban environments, more akin to a golf-cart, or a [tuk-taxi](http://www.nomad4ever.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/tuk_tuk_taxi_in_bangkok_thailand.jpg) let's say, than a typical american car. When you consider it that way, it doesn't seem so unlikely that they could turn out some sort of car-like vehicle.

A vehicle like that might not initially be accepted in North America, but in emerging developing world auto-markets where there isn't the sort of established driving culture we have here, a fleet of basic and affordable robotaxis would be accepted with open arms, and could be very successful.

Or, In America, they may start out in places like University Campuses or Tourist areas such as the Vegas strip. A chance to demo the tech, sort out management logistics, and acclimatize the public.

Starting at the low end of a market fits neatly with the established model for market disruption as preached by Harvard Economist Clayton Christensen, as summarized in this [article](http://www.wired.com/business/2013/02/mf-clayton-christensen-wants-to-transform-capitalism/all/).

My idea for a brand new business would be beds for cars. There is no such thing today. If you want to sleep in a car you can sleep but someone else has to drive.

But once we get self-driving cars everyone could sleep on their commute. And cars are different enough from apartments that you can't just shove any old bed in there. And people actually care a lot about what they sleep on.

So I foresee a brand new business niche of sleep related things for cars.

How about an integration of your company calendar with your car. So that if your morning meeting gets cancelled your alarm gets moved to an hour later, so you get an extra hour of sleep in your company's parking lot.

I agree. I think that's why they keep pushing the 5-year timeline, to get other automakers to commit to a date. 

I still think Google's main interest here is the data stream. Their cars require wireless transmission of high-quality maps of all roads in real-time.

I personally suspect it's likely the aggressive scenario will play out starting in ~4-years when the first Google car or some other car(s) are released.

However, these cars already drive and technically could be released tomorrow. If they were, at first there would be a transitional phase where the car would drive most places that it's trained to drive, and then ask humans to take over as required. There would be an intense period of learning and experimentation to create a car that could anticipate all driving conditions and circumstances better than a human.

Snow would not be a problem. Many modern vehicles already have [electronic traction control](http://auto.howstuffworks.com/28000-traction-control-explained.htm) that limits spinning tires. From there it's not too difficult to engineer for the rest of the circumstances of snow and ice.

GPS is not used to navigate the car. A 3D model of the road is created before the car drives. Then the car uses Lidar and radar to recognize where it is in the 3D world and avoid obstacles.

I think this was his main argument, plus the fact that most of the developers use the word autonomous when they really mean self-driving in select situation, for example Google's blind man video and the limited abilities of the actual car. 

I have two reasons against the 2020 timeline. First, this timeline is conveniently in line with Google's 2018 prediction. Most of the automakers seemed to have no plans for full automation until Google's car, and seem to be playing catch up. Google is not promising full-automation by 2018, just a car for sale. For an automaker to re-create and surpass all of Google's work within 8 years seems unlikely.

Second, although hardware follows Moore's law, software does not. Instead, it gets more and more difficult to improve software as it grows.

If self-driving taxis give the middle class access to [$0.15 per mile transportation](http://sustainablemobility.ei.columbia.edu/files/2012/12/Transforming-Personal-Mobility-Jan-27-20132.pdf), it would lower the cost of commuting 50 miles to $7.50 each way, and 100 miles to $15 each way.

The folks at Google, Nissan and other companies are not trying to kill anyone, but you can bet your ass they won't start selling this technology to the general public if there is any possibility of a crash and a resultant claim.

Driving is an art as much as it is a science.  On the road, you need to deal with unpredictable conditions and a huge number of possibilities, and navigate your way safely through.  Often you need to assume what other drivers are doing, and those assumptions can sometimes be wrong.  If an obstacle appears on the road, you need to decide weather to avoid it or avoid hitting another car or anything else.  In addition to reacting immediately, you must do so with limited information about what an obstacle is.  Computer scientists have shown that it's not even possible to generally determine weather a program infinitely loops or not, how do expect them to write a general algorithm that guarantees it won't cause a collision, or at least play a role in a collision that might occur?

Answer this question:  How should driverless cars react to speed limits?

A.  Programmed to follow the posted speed limits OR
B.  Programmed to break the posted speed limits when the rest of the traffic does.

See, with manual drive, manufacturers get to take option C, by not setting any government and avoiding all liability.

People outside the US see this question and immediately say ""Option A of course!  Why should anyone be breaking the speed limit?""  But there are hundreds of thousands of stupidly low speed limits in the US and millions of people trained to ignore them.

If you choose option A, in the US, you'd be breaking the assumed right of every Murrican to break the speed limits with those damn self-driving cars clogging up all the traffic!  They'd be blamed every time someone cut out into traffic to pass them and public perception would sour in a heartbeat.  You'd have an armed protest against EVERY step of the process to legalize driverless cars.

You also can't choose option B, because the ~~driver who breaks~~ designer who lets the car break the law is at least 50% responsible for every accident.  Want a quick settlement from the manufacturer?  Jump out in front of a fast-moving driverless car and sue them for breaking the speed-limit.

A great way would be by mile, or added to a gas tax, but again that is a long term equilibrium. There will always be deer, kids jumping out from between parked cars, sink holes opening up, earthquakes, etc. so while insurance premiums will decline, so will payouts and therefore the ""fight"" will not be against a new technology, but rather to ensure a retained seat at the table.

I don't think there's really any way to tell. 

Presumably accident frequency will decline but most of the comprehensive claims for hail and vandalism and so forth will continue. A drastic reduction in collision frequency may make it financially feasible for manufacturers to utilize much more expensive &amp; functionally unrepairable materials like carbon fiber into many more vehicles. Essentially trading reduced frequency for increased payments per claim. 

I think the trial lawyers may be spooked by any large reduction in injury claims. It would seem to be to their benefit to steer liability law regarding self-driving cars towards the manufacturers where the deep pockets are. This would indicate significantly higher vehicle costs unless the AI is so good it's functionally foolproof. That cost would get passed on to buyers in the form of higher vehicle costs, which in turn is passed-on in premium.

I'm starting to see the results of driver assist technology already on the street. A simple example would be radar cruise control units. The beam frequently travels through the grille emblem. On a Prius the regular Toyota emblem is around $50. On the radar cruise version it's $900. I wrote a Mercedes SL550 yesterday and the emblem was like $65 but the radar cruse equipped one was $650.

They can recognize human shapes, and they know when they're at crosswalks, and they can read crosswalk lights. 

If you see a person at a crosswalk you'll slow down and stop. If they don't cross the road and just stand there, then you'll proceed slowly until you're clear of the person. Same for a self driving car.

Outside of a crosswalk, you don't expect a person to cross the road unless they've actually stepped out into the street, or are on a set trajectory. So you slow down and slam the brakes if you have to. Same for a self-driving car.

If a pedestrian darts out out of nowhere, you slam the brakes regardless.

In so much as the car is capable of knowing what a human sized moving object is, and tracking movement, and understanding context, the whole thing can be reduced to a fairly simple procedural algorithm. 

When I'm driving, if somebody is doing something I don't understand, or is on the meridian or in the road, I slow down to non-lethal speeds and proceed cautiously regardless. For any unconventional situation, just slowing down is sufficient, it's pretty hard to plow somebody at 10km/hr.

And keep in mind, people like construction workers or cops at an accident directing traffic can modify their behavior when dealing with a self-driving car as well.

Usually on a busy downtown street, a pedestrian on the curb still has to walk across a parking lane before they're directly in front of a moving vehicle, so a self driving car has at least that much leeway to interpret a pedestrians intentions.

My own research tells me sensor costs are plummeting already. Moore's law tells me hardware costs will plummet too.  We will see.
3) That's because they are in a closed Beta test and because that particular Velodyne sensor is the best one for their needs right now.  When sensors improve (Velodyne DO have competition!) and the automakers get onvolved, then the self-driving cars will look so much better.

Bad business. No point in bringing in a partner that won't shrink development time, whom you only need for launch and then are dead weight after that. Self driving cars isn't a particularly difficult problem to solve today.

It would have happened by now if this was true.

A self-driving car that spends most of its time in your garage is like paying a personal chauffeur to sit and drinks coffee all day while waiting for you to want to go somewhere. It's a waste. But for a business it's the opposite. Eliminating the salary and benefits of a taxi driver would cut the operating cost of a typical taxi by about $40K/year, not to mention the decreased insurance cost. I think this will drive fares down low enough that for most people taking cabs will be cheaper than owning a car. No car also means no car insurance, no maintenance, no need to dedicate part of the house to garage space.

This is the whole thing for me, right here. Software built for a task at my job may have a lot of things wrong with it, but that's because it was built in-house by people making way less than they should to design something on a budget that's too small in a timeframe that's too short. The end product technically does what it's supposed to but at the cost of usability and function. My company either doesn't have, or doesn't want to spend, the money to make software that is intuitive to the people who use it. They figure that if they give you something that ""works"", then you should be able to work around it's flaws or get used to the hoops you have to jump through to get your work done.

A sudden error message that wasn't properly handled? Just go do something else after submitting a ticket to have it ""fixed"".

Unlike the software at my job, the software required to drive a car by itself needs to be able to handle every ""error"" that comes up, be it mechanical failure, another car doing something out of the ordinary, or some other unforeseen circumstance.

While there's only so much you can code for, I highly doubt the folks at Google are going to stop at writing software the pushes the gas and the brakes when necessary. They will most likely try to come up with a solution to every possible thing that the car would need to react to, and in the cases where there isn't a protocol to handle it, the car should tell you to take over.

I would hope that in a hypothetical future where all cars are self-driving wouldn't make the programmers assume that packing them in as close as possible would outweigh the cons of sudden mechanical failures, etc. But that's the beauty of trying to program a car to drive itself in a time where the vast majority of other vehicles are driven by humans. Figuring out how to handle errors in an environment where so many variables are unforeseen will make it easier to handle errors in an environment where all cars are driving themselves.

I'm skeptical that we'll ever be at a point where all cars are self-driven, but I would love to be able to let my car do the heavy lifting from time to time.",1379619368,ccblign,t1_ccbjy9q,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2013

Self-driving cars will need to be networked for constant optimization of road usage in order to avoid building new roads. Set rules about lane direction, maximum speed and handling intersections will become flexible. Cities will do whatever is required to avoid massive road construction costs. The network will lead to your personal movement being monitored and controlled by a central agency. You'll pay for the network through tolls. You'll pay tolls as soon as you leave your driveway.

Roads will be partitioned the way the internet is being tiered today. There will be no net neutrality for the transportation network. If you work for the government or big corporation or can afford premium tolls then you will be whisked along on the fastest routes. If you can't pay much, you might find your car pulling to the side of the road to let deserving riders pass you.

It is ironic the the same techies that fight for internet freedom and privacy are pushing for self driving cars. Be careful what you wish for. The internet didn't start under government control and yet the government has done a good job of getting their fingers in the mix. Roads are a different story. Have you heard of the [U.S. Department of Transportation](http://www.dot.gov/)? This won't be a case of the government weaseling their way into self driving car networks. You're entering their turf now. Good luck.

If you want to experience the frustration of a self driving car today then use any public restroom with automated toilets and faucets. Did the toilet flush at the wrong time or not at all? Having trouble rinsing the soap off your hands because the water cuts off too soon? These are real world examples of the tradeoffs in automation. I suggest reading [The Design of Everyday Things](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=The+Design+of+Everyday+Things) to learn about the challenges with proper design.

If you think Google is smart and won't make design mistakes and tradeoffs then I suggest you look at they're pride and joy,  Google+. Heaven help us if Google is in charge.

Free range cars will no longer be used by low ranking civilians due to prohibitively high insurance costs. They will still be available in third world countries. Vacation packages will be available to these places for those who want to experience the nostalgia of personal freedom.

Most of us will ride, not in a self driving car, but in a self driving bus. It will be cool, you'll get an app and the bus will find you. What happens if you are molested while on the bus? Well, probably the same approach that is being deployed today in some real world light rail systems. You'll be asked to depart at the next stop and call police. They will determine which police department has jurisdiction based on the location of the bus at the time of the assault. Eventually you'll get help.

Anyone riding in a self driving car will have no privacy. The car will bristle with sensors on the outside... and inside. It will be necessary to know exactly who is in the car and what they are doing. Certain undesirables will be on a no-ride list and will not be allowed in private self driving cars. We can't have people loading up self driving cars with explosives/poison and sending them off on automated missions of mass destruction, drive by shootings or bank robberies.

How will the undesirables get about? Self driving buses. Move over, make room. Keep track of your location at all times.

The good news is that having criminals on your bus route increases your chance of getting a ride. Self driving buses will be like money seeking missiles. You won't pay a fixed fee. It will be more like... an auction. How desperate are you to get where you're going? Enter your bid now in your public transportation app. Having friends (and enemies) along for the same ride will help you in the bidding war.

What people fail to realize is that automating cars isn't a hardware problem anymore, we've had that technology for the last 10+ years.  There are different approaches you can take from the sensor/hardware side.  It's figuring out the software algorithms that are the real barrier to making this work.  Showing off the fact that you can hide your sensors or use cheaper off-the-shelf LIDAR is roughly equal to bragging about your amazing car body design without having an engine capable of running it.  Who cares?  

Regarding your ludicrous assumption that Google is playing catch up with Carnegie Mellon shows your lack of research on this topic.  Google isn't playing catch-up with CMU because they *hired* them.  Most of the leaders and engineers of the Google Car project come from the best of the Stanford and Carnegie-Mellon teams who won/lead the DARPA challenges in '04 and '05. 

Here is an excerpt from the PopSci article regarding the pricetag on the LIDAR system.

*A grizzled maverick of an engineer named David Hall designed the lidar that Google uses. His company, Velodyne, makes a unit that packs 64 lasers in a turret that typically rotates at 600 rpm, continuously strafing the landscape with 64 separate beams. “For the autonomous vehicle, I’m kind of the only thing that works,” Hall says.* 

*Industry scuttlebutt has it that Ford is giving Google the most serious consideration. Hall confirms that a major automaker recently summoned him to its headquarters to ask whether he could make a next-generation lidar—a ruggedized, standardized automotive component. The company wanted a design that it could hide (perhaps behind the windshield) that would wholesale for no more than $1,000, and it wanted a prototype immediately. If it liked what it saw, it promised to buy a thousand units—in four years’ time.*

*Hall rebuffed the offer. “If you look at this from a venture capital point of view,” he says, “that’s just about the stupidest idea anyone’s ever come up with.” Hall is confident that with enough time and resources, he could engineer a $1,000 lidar unit, but why bother? It would be many more years before a self-driving car is brought to market, prompting lidar orders in the hundreds of thousands. The return on the engineering investment might be negative for decades to come.*

Really the only advantage that Google has is that they might have gotten a two or three year jump on the rest of the industry by hiring some of the best talent in the country and funding them first.  I find it very unlikely they will ever build their own car.  They'll simply try to make the best software (something they are very good at) and sell it to somebody else.

157,PaulGodsmark,"I am an outspoken advocate of self-driving cars in Canada - and I have morphed from a highway engineer into a road safety professional over the last 6 years.  I would say the average road safety professional has a shelf life of less than 8 years - me included.

What you describe is exactly the reason that I have been calling for every country in the world to consider an over-arching technology deployment ROAD MAP for self-driving cars.  This would involve strategic thinking and planning from government and business/trade organizations at the very highest level.  The reason we all need to start this process now is because self-driving cars will result in most countries in money flows equivalent to about 10-20% of GDP.  On his Forbes articles Chunka Mui estimated that globally this would be trillions of dollars - I agree.

With Google clearly stating that they aspire to have fully self-driving vehicles in public hands by 2017 then we may only have four years in which to prepare.  In Canada it is predicted that if we carry on as we are that we will have a shortage of 30,000 truck drivers by 2020.  At this moment in time 1.5% of the working population of Canada drive a truck.  But self-driving trucks will rapidly turn that statistic on its head.  Right now the government are gearing up to best meet this labour shortage.  Yet part way through their program to 2020 the tables could be dramatically turned.

Clearly the societal impact with most of those truckers facing losing their jobs is enormous.  But is we start planning now, we can at least seek to mitigate the worst impacts.  If we do nothing there will be massive collateral damage.

Hence my call for an over-arching technology deployment road map.  We need to plan now for how we might re-train some 1.5% of the working population - or maybe a lot more.

Even though my current career can be expected to disappear, I remain convinced that the potential societal benefits of fully self-driving cars are so great that we simply cannot afford to unnecessarily delay their deployment.

Based on the 2004 to 2007 DARPA challenges that led to this latest impetus to self-driving car development, and then looking at this years DARPA Robotic Challenge, then I expect that we will see autonomous robots doing manual work outside of factories by about 2021-2023.  This could de-construct capitalism as we know it - leaving our wealth to be measured in how many robots we own.

We really do need to plan better for exponential technology development in my opinion.  The self-driving car will be the forerunner of the societal impact of autonomous robots.  We have to have public and political policy precede the technology, otherwise we face being swept away by the consequences of it.",1379810618,cccx2jl,t3_1mv38k,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2013
158,PaulGodsmark,"What Musk has announced is a 90% self-driving car. That will allegedly improve your driving experience and safety, but it will also end up de-skilling you and lead to all sorts of additional distracted driving situations. But Musk has to be seen to follow the automaker herd.

None of the automakers really want to build a fully self-driving car as it means that there will be a massive increase in automated shared mobility fleets - which means the auotmakers 130 year old business model will bust. They won't be able to sell at least one car to everybody. Currently one car-share company vehicle typically takes 9 to 14 private cars off the road (Shaheen UC Berkely). We could easily say that one self-driving fleet car will take 2.5 private cars off the road (Kornhauser, Princeton). They will then end up selling far more cars to fleet buyers - who will want a more rugged, durable, reliable and easily maintained product.
But if a 90% self-driving car will make it's onwer's life easier, this pales in comparison to the fully self-driving car technology that Google aspire to have in our hands by 2017. That will transform society - much like the internet has done.

The difference between a Tesla 90% self driving car, and the 99.9999% self-driving car that Google are aiming for is so many magnitudes different it doesn't even bear comparison. Right now any motivated undergraduate course given 3 years could produce something approaching a 90% self-driving car. I therefore have no doubt that Tesla will be successful in this.

But society transforms when we have a fully self-driving car. The products that Tesla and Google aspire to provide are two totally seperate things.

Also, be aware that the secret of a fully self driving car is the Artificial Intelligence Operating System (AIOS). A software 'brain' is the key to success - the automotive engineering side is merely a distraction here. Any established automaker is capable of integrating the sensors and the requisite automotive components that are necessary to facilitate automated driving. The key to success is the AIOS - the electronic brain.

So to even think that Tesla are going to catch up, or even overtake Google in that department is... preposterous. Google have been developing their AIOS for over four years now, having cherry-picked some of the best people from the DARPA challenge. They have a team of over 62 staff in the self-driving car team, and goodness knows how many people in AI development and virtual testing also assist behind the scenes. They have one of the most advanced AI research groups in the world. They have approximately 32 test vehicles on public roads that have racked up well over 500,00 miles of real world testing. They have a $50bn cash pile to call upon if needed.

So what Musk is doing is not competing with Google. But he does seem to be preparing the way so that if he chooses to licence the Google AIOS in the future then he will have a fully tested understanding of how to integrate the necessary sensors into one of his amazing vehicles.",1379814245,cccy389,t3_1mp79n,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2013

I guess the problem here is that - while humans are generally really good at a lot of tasks, we introduce unpredictable errors and supporting the limits of our biology is inefficient. Truck drivers need to be comfortable in the cab, eat, sleep, pee, be safe in case of an accident, communicate by radio, watch dvds, etc. Let all the old truckers keep their jobs... just don't train any new ones?",1379821680,ccd05b4,t1_cccvm67,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2013

You're worried about processing information in 1/4 second? My computer processes 5,000,000,000 operations per second. A truly efficient self-driving car network will process and adjust for something like a tire blowout in a hundredth of a second - and that's assuming that it doesn't adjust for the blowout before it actually happens.

As you say, there are sensors, today, for tire pressure. In a self-driving car, those sensors are not just sensing pressure, they're a part of the car's driving consciousness. A sudden loss of pressure can be communicated *instantly* to the vehicle systems and the other vehicles nearby, with no loss of control. Any flying debris can be tracked by multiple cars, avoided, and marked for lather cleanup. It's possible that an intelligent car could handle a blowout without even jostling the passengers inside.

Overall Level 3 will help reduce crashes - but for some drivers it could raise their risk profile.  Overall we can expect to see driver de-skilling.  Yet the whole point of having the driver ready to take over is because they have greater skill than the autopilot.

I agree that Tesla can more easily migrate to the Google fully self-driving system if they have laid the groundwork properly.

What I find fascinating is that the arguments seem to me at least, to be getting weaker with time.

Having spent some time with and listening to some of the top legal experts in the world I find their view of fully self-driving cars to be very pragmatic.  They are not concerned at all that the law in the US won't cope - they view the law as being very robust and capable of accommodating change.  What they don't have is the answers - how the law will rule on the early cases - but reading between the lines you can tell that their  gut instinct is that they don't expect the law to be unduly restrictive.  They seem to recognize that the in the balance of probabilities that the societal benefits of fully automated vehicles could be such that the law will accommodate in part and adapt in part.

To a 'lay person' this op-ed piece lays out a number of perfectly reasonable concerns - but it has made no attempt to see if the developers and researchers are seeking answers to these problems.  As ever, the assumption is that some sort of 'nerd' or 'geek' is developing this, who is disassociated from real life and doesn't understand the reality of what it might mean.

This is not only unfeasible but also creepily big brother like. Putting them in roads would be at astronomical cost. People also don't like to wear things that track them. It's better to make the car autonomous and able to detect things on their own.

&gt;self driving cars that are aware of everything on the road, do not need stop lights.

That is an absolutely horrid idea! What if the network goes down? What if the server goes down? What if latency is high? I could go on but I think you get it. Any number of innumerable problems could cause catastrophic failure. It's better to make an autonomous system that can operate as normal if any particular part goes down.

&gt;The biggest issue I see is network security.

There's that, too. You have no idea how big of a risk this is. Even if you think you do. You don't. Not only for causing wrecks but for intrusive surveillance, and international spying.

&gt; a piece of code that instructs vehicles to crash into the nearest object could be theoretically inserted into the supercomputer and that’s a scary scenario.

It's rarely that simple and AFAIK injection attacks are becoming less common. You couldn't just tell a car 'crash in to that wall'. It's far more complicated than that.

&gt; Still I think the main hurdles for this type of system are security ones, rather than technological ones

Yes there are security issues to the current system in place but not the ones you're thinking of. There are also main technological hurdles despite what we've seen so far out of Google.

Sensors need not be obtrusive. A cellphone that is a part of the network would work and there are already ""smart"" buildings that have sensors in them that report to a computer in real time. I don't disagree that it would be creepy and big brother like, though. It would be at first.

&gt;What about motorcycles? I ride motorcycle and there's no way in hell I'd buy one that drove me

The self driving ""organism"" would be aware of your motorcycle. Your crotch-rocket (or Harley) would be a part of the system, so you could drive it yourself, and the self driving cars would make room for you. Anyone who  wants to drive there car could do so in this system.

&gt;I doubt people will trust machines that much in the near future. That's also pretty much asking for your car to get stolen

I would definitely trust my car to pick up groceries for me, and I don't think its a streach to say many other people would too. It wouldn't be any harder or easier to steal the car then if you had driven it to the grocery store yourself. Actually, it would probably be harder, because it would likely take workers a shorter amount of time to load your car up, then it would for you to shop. I think its fair to say less time in a parking lot means less of a chance for your car to get stolen.

And this is all assuming that car ownership would still be a popular thing. If it was cheaper to simply pay, lets say $100/month, to be a part of an automated taxi service, why would most people still own a car? 

&gt;That is an absolutely horrid idea! What if the network goes down?

This is your best criticism, I think, but your first sentence is unnecessary. Do you really need to tell me my idea is horrid? Just tell me why its horrid. Yes, we would need to make advances in network stability and security for sure, but I don't see that as an impossible hurdle. It is a difficult one, though, that probably doesn't have an easy solution.

189,PaulGodsmark,"This article in some ways highlights the automakers quandary. The automakers have a tried and tested 130 year old business model of incremental improvements where they seek to sell everyone of us at least one vehicle. They sell speed, power, luxury, connectivity, versatility, safety (except some of the previous sales points are in direct contradiction of safety?...) etc.

Such a business model is great for shareholders in these automakers - but considering most vehicles stand around idle for 95% of the time, this can be considered a serious waste of the earth's finite resources. Also consider that human error is a factor in some 93% of crashes - we have a terrible conundrum where there is an entire industry, including aftermarket parts, that relies on crashes occurring.

Whereas a truly self-driving, NHTSA Level 4 automated vehicle, one that is capable of driving unmanned, challenges (if not disrupts) this business model. Instead it inevitably leads to the development of automated shared mobility fleets - especially from the business models of taxi, car-rental, car-share, ride-share and P2P companies.

We know from studies that 1shared vehicle can typically take 9 to 13 private vehicles off the road (Shaheen, UC Berkeley). Studies around the shared automated fleets, or 'a-taxis' suggests that 1 fully automated Level 4 car could take at least 2.5 private vehicles off the road (Kornhauser, Princeton) - if not more.

With these a-taxis the average person could relinquish ownership of their private vehicle and hire the right size vehicle for their commute to work, family time at the weekend, shifting goods etc. - and save 40% of annual transportation outlay in the process.

So with a-taxis we would find that the automakers sell more cars to the fleets and less to private owners. Which means that their 130 year old business model no longer looks so robust. Fleet owners will want very different characteristics in their cars and they will be very aggressive on beating down prices.

So comments like the one automakers make in this article about costs and keeping the driver in the loop etc. don't really stack up when you consider the likely new business models and the societal benefits that Level 4 automated vehicles can bring.

Finally - please note that the 2020 date for this technology from the automakers is not for Level 4 automated technology - but Level 3, where the driver is required to be in the loop still - because that preserves their business model - 1 driver, 1 car.

Whereas [Google have explicitly stated that their aspiration is to bring Level 4 to the market as their first product](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMtz97GZtF8).
On the Friday following this referenced presentation by Ron Medford, Google confirmed to me in a public meeting for California dealing with driverless cars that they stand by Sergey Brin's statement at the California autonomous vehicle bill signing that they are aiming for 2017.

So when you read what the automakers are saying on the subject of driverless cars, please consider that there is another side to the story and the business models and agendas lie behind much of what is said.

2017 is the date that we should be preparing for. To not do so risks all sorts of avoidable societal collateral damage.",1379956472,ccdvnte,t3_1myoa4,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2013

No, Google is dealing with ONE FORM of human driver behavior change in the presence of a TEST vehicle.

Humans are capable of a wide range of different behaviors -- in fact there are entire scientific fields that have been *attempting* to come up with just some rudimentary concepts of the various types of behaviors that humans exhibit -- and have generally not gotten beyond rather crude ""speculative hypotheses"" (many of them rather contradictory, as human behavior is far from a predictable thing).

What Google is NOT dealing with (and cannot test for) is what the types of behavior will occur when (and if) these vehicles begin to become common, much less prevalent.

&gt;Because they are having to deal with these issues already, is why I am in agreement with the statement that integration gets easier when there are more of these fully self-driving cars on the road.

My personal favourite and one that is the best from my perspective is the [TRB Workshop on Road Vehicle] Automation(http://www.vehicleautomation.org/).

The next workshop is already being planned for 2014.  Although about 40% presentations it is intended to be 60% workshop.

[PodCar City 7](http://www.podcarcity.org/washington/) will include some information on self-driving cars, but how much I don't know. 

The [First International Workshop on Computer Vision for Autonomous Driving](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~CVAD2013/) - sounds like it is very focussed on the relevant vision aspects.

The [Florida Automated Vehicles Summit](http://fleng.org/seminars.cfm?event_id=598) looks like it could be good.

The Connected Car conferences are obviously focussing on a different technology and so you won't learn a great deal about automated vehicles.

The LA Motor show will obviously have all of the automakers, but not necessarily the automated vehicle developers like Google, VisLab, AutoNOMOS labs and the academics (TRB is best for that).

The reason human-driven cars will be the domain of the rich is that I see human-driven cars going the way of the horse. Not a soul today uses horses for everyday transportation, but lots of rich people ride them for fun daily. I see closed-course ""driving tracks"" becoming a thing in the future.

Self driving cars have the potential to increase road capacity to passenger rail levels. We don't mix trains with bicycles or pedestrians today, and it could make sense to have a few dedicated corridors that only cars would use. I can't see why other roads wouldn't mix nicely though.

If we move towards a shared taxi model of transportation that requires little or no parking area, some parking lanes on the side of streets could be converted into pedestrian spaces or bike lanes.

Make the the center of the network simple and stupid (Internet protocols haven't changed much at all since the 80s) and allow a huge revolution of innovation to occur at the edges.

I think you are mistaken.  For someone to rent, it means someone else has to own that car for them to rent.  For that someone to own, they have to charge enough per mile and/or per hour to cover all the costs, plus make a profit.

At some point, use of the vehicle over a certain amount will mean rental is more expensive that owning.

For example, in this current age of driving, people own cars when they could rent or take a taxi everywhere.   Most people don't because renting is far more expensive than owning.  And using taxi's is even more so. Using a taxi is fine if it's a short distance or emergency but most people wouldn't use a taxi to commute to work 20+ miles each way daily.

Sure, with self-driving cars, taxi costs will drop considerably.  However, it will simply move that cost/benefit point over, not eliminate it entirely.  For many people it will still be far cheaper to own rather than rent from someone else who is going to make a profit on them.

Ok, yes, if someone living in a remote area needs a vehicle just once a week, to go visit their grandkids 10 miles away, then sure, renting would be ideal.

I don't understand why you see this as so ridiculous.  The article is not trying to tell people not to drive, it's just offering a different way of looking at the world.  The amount of young people that die in car accidents *is* inexcusable, in my opinion, but self-driving cars will correct this problem.  That's why I posted it in this sub.

&gt;What is a fucking safe fell on the guys head? Just because some one was in a car accident in their life doesn't mean that that accident had anything whatsoever to do with with their death. And what about other confounding factors like was the guy a smoker, what was his diet etc, etc? 

It takes all of those things into account.  Remember, the study does not look at these things only through the lens of death.  It counts the living who are suffering disabilities, as well as those who die from diseases, and accidents.  That's why the information is valuable; it can improve the lives of those who are still alive, as well as help prevent deaths. For example, if a person gets in a car accident at 20, and suffers chronic back pain for 20 years, *until* a safe falls on his head, the death will be listed as accidental, but the back pain will detract from the total healthy years of life lived.  The system does not wait until someone has died to tally up the years-lived with a disability.  That total runs with people as they they are still alive.  The total disability-adjusted life years must be calculated after death, but car accident didn't kill the man, so the running total of years-lived with a disability would *not* count against the car accident.

The people who set up this system are not idiots, they have accounted for essentially everything that you take issue with.

This will not be a problem with self-driving cars. If I can just call a car with an uber like service and it shows up within 5 minutes, I imagine it would become a lot more popular. Of course, longer distance drives are still a ripoff with current car share services, so that's another reason to own. Whether the economics of long-distance car shares ever works out still remains to be seen, but if it could be coupled with a cheap/efficient high-speed rail system (and shared cars on either end of the trip), I imagine it could be an appealing option.

I would guess that car share services will greatly grow, especially in urban centers (note that Avis bought Zipcar and Hertz, Enterprise, U-Haul and Daimler are also getting into the business - there's clearly a market here) and will become hugely popular with self-driving cars. There still will be a pretty big market for the people that like to own cars (and places where there isn't a dense enough population for the economics of car shares to really make sense).",1380838753,cckist9,t1_cckgibj,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2013

GPS is not accurate enough to rely on for navigating the road, only for approximating location, speed and direction. The car still has to read the road in order to navigate it safely.

I'm in the UK, but the same should apply anywhere. If the car judges that it is can't drive safely, it should either refuse to drive, or relinquish full control to the human driver with a warning that the conditions are dangerous.

&gt;LIDAR is but one of the sensors used. Some automakers rely only on cameras.

No matter what combination of sensors are used, if they are being confused or given misleading readings by inclement weather conditions then the car should either ignore them, or remain at a standstill.

Assuming Google is successful in completing it's AI by 2017:

- **Agriculture** - Very basic automated systems already exist primarily relying on only RTK GPS. These will quickly become ubiquitous as GPS systems are combined with the new techniqes being invented for self driving cars
- **Commercial Goods** - The first shipping company to go self driving will be able to slash their rates and capture huge market share. It will likely be economical to convert existing rigs to self driving. Conversion en masse to begin in 2018 and be completed in the early 2020's.
- **Taxi service** - With Uber leading the way to remove the political barriers, taxis can be added incrementally the day after the cars are ready. I expect large fleets might be implemented in a handful of cities in 2017/2018, then added in additional cities as all roads are 3D scanned to allow self driving cars to navigate them. Most of the worlds manufacturing capacity will rapidly be switched to producing self driving vehicles (~15M cars are sold in the US every year and ~60M are manufactured every year worldwide). Manufacturers will run plants overtime for the first few years to meet the demand of replacing the old fleet. By 2025-2030, it could be rare for humans to drive ever.
- **Consumer Vehicles** - Few individuals might ever buy their own self driving car, opting instead to just use the new taxi services. Private ownership may never be legalized due to risks of using automated cars to deliver terrorist payloads, and the requirement to constantly upgrade and refine the software in the early years after commercialization.

Then, let us also say that the Princeton study is correct in saying that in switching to self-driving cars, we could use 1 self-driving car to replace 2.5 current cars during peak hours.

With these assumptions, we need 400,000 self-driving cars at peak hours (400,000 * 2.5 = 1,000,000).  We then have a vehicle fleet of 400,000, which can handle transportation at up to maximum current demand...  This means that a vehicle fleet of 400,000 can *also* handle transportation under constraints of *less* than peak demand.  If it is enough to carry everyone under the worst-case scenario, it is also enough to carry everyone under every other scenario.

Presumably, this will be rare, and the car will be able to pull over and flash a warning if a major sensor is impaired.

* Elderly person is able to afford a cheap trip to their destination in a ride-share service/self-driving taxi.

The option is open for someone who is moving from your destination to your current city to rent that truck for the return trip saving both of you money.  Meanwhile you can still get a ride in a local autonomous taxi to work.

* Ranchers will almost certainly continue to own their personal vehicles if they have large property.

* If entire cities are sharing the cost of the cars we're essentially permanently subletting the cars to and from each other and the parent company making the cost per car dirt cheap.

* Logging, mining, agriculture and so on and etc.

* Instead of paying the gas to drive it there and back just arrive and hop in the local cheap autonomous taxi service.  Honestly though who needs three suitcases and a carry-on?  That's an extra $50-$100 in luggage fees which is likely still cheaper than a two-way trip for your car at $3.50-$4.00 per gallon.

Generally motorcyclists ride for fun instead of the utility of point A to point B like your average car commuter.  Since they're mostly only a threat to themselves the laws would likely be less stringent regarding their safety software.  The day cars begin to shrink when software enables safety instead of size and crumple zones however this would have to change. ",1381240586,ccng39k,t1_ccnbf2b,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2013

The amount of retail space required to be maintained per consumer would plummet. Many wal-mart, grocery, or shopping mall locations could close down completely and would have to be redeveloped for some other lower value purpose.

A mechanism from getting you from point A to point B makes even more sense to me if there are then convenient ways to get to and from A and B to your actual destination.

If I'm traveling long distance, I'm going to greatly prefer a train, which is cheap and allows me to walk around, talk to people, and use a bathroom, to a cramped aTaxi which is going to require fueling.

Likewise, even if the distance is relatively short, public transit still makes sense to me in an automated world.  Bus routes become more like airline transit routes:  They take large groups of people to the center-of-mass of their likely destinations, with few intervening stops, and do this cost-effectively.  From these hubs, people can then cheaply use local infrastructure (aTaxis) to get to their exact destination.  A bus is just a more efficient mode of travel: it can carry more people for a lower cost per person, taking up much less total space than each in their own vehicle.

Self-driving cars seem to negate the two major drawbacks of public transit:  Frequent stops (no longer as necessary, because you can always summon a car to bring you from the nearest stop), and inexact routes.",1381278127,ccnu7hc,t3_1o01hq,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2013

In fact, cars driving without people in them means more miles traveled and thus a possibility of more demand for fuel...  Most of these self-driving cars will likely have internal combustion engines.

Of course, self-driving cars allow you to minimize the inconvenience of a limited range slow-charging electric vehicle, but there doesn't look to be a lot of work on that synergy in the near term.

In terms of less intuitive things:  I would look at the biproducts of redevelopment of inner cities.  Once infrastructure gets more self-driving, there is a lot of potential to reclaim space allocated to parking, error-prone human drivers, and to traffic reduction.  We're talking about hundreds of acres of just about every major US city.  You can speculate on how this space will be used and the implications this would have, or you could purchase land that is has use that is currently limited by wide roads and parking spaces, betting that you'll eventually get a parklet or outdoor space.

Alternatively:  Supermarkets, and large retail chains.  There already is a trend of grocery delivery emerging.  Google Shopping Express, and whatever ebay's competitor to this was both indicate what could be a future market trend (they both think so, which is why they're getting in on it early).

I don't know about that. I would think it would just not do anything in that situation since there is nowhere to go.

A person might try to ram the vehicles ahead of them or somehow get away but it's probably safer for everyone to let the truck ram your rear end and force you into the car ahead of you.  Unless the car ahead of you is another truck, and the truck behind you is really heavy and not braking at all.  If that happens you're gonna get squished.

I have not come across any that are ACTIVELY 'fighting' or opposed, but some have vested interests that are negatively impacted by self-driving cars, and so are not inclined to be helpful.  Transit authorities are a good example - with a 150 year old proven business model in rail, why should they suddenly get all excited about what is probably just another in a very long line of 'super-duper' solutions that fizzles out and comes to nothing.  Parking authorities/designs are another - all the time we have increasing numbers of people then we will need more parking spaces - period.

Generally the problem is a lack of awareness, which if you can overcome then you need to deal with a lack of understanding of the wider and deeper implications.  Once you overcome that then there is the bureaucratic inertia.  

All the while there is the credibility gap and the probably the biggest problem of all: We need a paradigm shift in government to allow policy to precede technology.

Government wants to see well developed research, pilot projects, a period for reflection whilst someone else tries it out (and goes up the learning curve) and then they will decide if it is for them.  Normally this is a very prudent approach and can take many years, often decades.  But this is disruptive technology and it is anything but normal - last seen some 100-odd years ago when we transitioned form horses to horseless carriages.

For the rarity question, ethical situations may seem rare because a human doesn't remember or recognize them. Like getting rear-ended, you may have had a way to trade that risk for another but you don't watch your rear-view like a computer would. Second, train and plane crashes are rare but that doesn't stop us from working on solutions.

His second argument is that computers are no worse than humans at ethics, especially when in a panic, so there's really no pressing need to improve computer ethics. I'd argue that if a computer has the ability to try and make these determinations, then it should. I suspect that's exactly how lawmakers will see it if one of their constituents dies in a self-driving car crash where all systems were functioning perfectly, regardless of fault. 

Here's my whole thing: everyone acknowledges that self-driving cars must continually assess its risk of crashing. There may not always be a zero risk alternative (even stopping on the shoulder carries a lot of risk), and so you have to balance risk. This is particularly hard, because it's not just your risk, its also the risk you're imposing on everyone else. The law doesn't capture this well, and it's very tough to code (see the struggles in the field of machine ethics). 

We're talking about selling these cars, and we barely know what they do in an emergency or how they calculate and balance risk. That's what the trolley problem is trying to get at.",1381514206,ccppccl,t3_1o89rl,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2013

375,PaulGodsmark,"I take a very optimistic view of the growth of fully self-driving cars (SDCs), and so consider that within 3 years of them being launched in most any jurisdiction that they could be doing over 5% of the vehicle miles travelled - and within 5 years over 10% of the VMT.  I assume to most people that about 1 in 20 vehicles being SDCs would be 'common'.

My reasoning is that businesses in particular will have to have SDCs to maintain or grow their market share - or risk losing out and possibly going bust.  This includes any fleet operators including road freight, logistics/parcels, taxi, car rental, car share, ride share and P2P companies.

As noted above, shared fleets such as automated taxis are central to this model - but when you look at taxi, car share, ride share and P2P business models now, then once they have SDCs their business models will be virtually indiscernible - they become automated taxi fleets.

There will probably be nothing to stop entrepreneurs buying their own SDC and hiring it out for the 90% of the time that they don't need it.  So rather than having an asset that is continually depreciating, they should cover their costs of ownership and possibly even make a small profit.

So, as the Earth Institute, Columbia University research shows (see link on the right), then the average person is some 40% better off by not owning a car and using the shared mobility fleets.

Self driving systems don't exist on the market yet, so they don't have a price. As most of the expense is software development, I expect the price will be negligible when it goes mass market, compared to the price of the vehicle itself. The hardware involved isn't more than a dozen cameras and a decent computer, all of which is cheap - all told there's no way it will exceed $2000 when sold as an OEM type system (aftermarket will of course be more expensive if it's possible at all, but why would you want a semi truck with a cab if it doesn't need a driver?).

Insurance will be cheaper than insuring human drivers. Self driving systems are already excellent an well practiced at the kind of driving that truckers do most (all highway, long term, tedious).

Right now there are a lot of trucks on the roads, especially in the morning. It makes sense for a single driver to drive as big a truck as possible, because it lowers the average transportation cost of the items he's transporting.  If he gets effectively $30 per mile and only transports one small item, that shipping cost will be high.  If he's transporting 3000 items, the shipping cost per item will be low.

I can see where smaller self driving delivery vehicles could change this.  No wages per mile would be involved anymore.  In addition, they could drive at night during non-peak hours and wait at the target location until day.

This would mostly work with single deliveries rather than a delivery vehicle making a lot of stops.

That's theoretical, though, and based on the assumption that adequate car services will become available. They probably will, but that may be over a much longer time frame than the car makers plan on.

&gt; 90% of people would find a better deal getting onboard with self-driving taxi services, rather than buying a car outright.

Perhaps. But will they? 90% of truck and SUV owners could probably drive much smaller, more efficient cars, saving many thousands of dollars on the upfront purchase price, and hundreds (or more) per year in fuel. And yet, trucks and SUVs remain a huge profit center for automakers. If they consumers always chose the most economically efficient option, the big 3 would have been out of business a long time ago.

Even if we eventually do move to a system where individual vehicle ownership is uncommon, I expect it to take many years. But even then, car companies will be selling lots of cars. Fewer may be needed in service at a time due to the greater usage efficiency, but that means every car gets significantly more use. So they have to be replaced more often. 

Also, those car services are mostly going to be buying brand new vehicles. The used market will dwindle to a small percentage of what it is now. Refurbished vehicles may become more common (as with computer/office equipment, etc... today). But manufacturer refurbished (or rebuilt) will likely be preferable over third party refurb. And that will be another profit center for automakers.

While computers are more attentive, they currently have limited sensor range and object recognition abilities. Humans are very good at interpreting lots of data and quickly focusing on what's important. 

Here are two experts on some of the [problems they're having so far:](http://www.thenational.ae/business/industry-insights/technology/self-driving-cars-are-no-longer-from-the-realm-of-science-fiction#full)

&gt;“There were no dangerous situations,” says Daimler board member Thomas Weber, the head of group research. “A lot of research work is still needed, but it showed us how extremely far we’ve come.”

&gt;He conceded there were some situations during the journey when the test driver had to intervene. At one point, an elderly lady at a pedestrian crossing beckoned the driver to pass before she walked over the street.

&gt;“He had to intervene manually and drive on because the car would otherwise just have stood still until she was gone.

&gt;“The driver also had to step in when the car entered a narrow road partly blocked by a luggage removal van. He had to steer the car on to the pavement to pass it. Using the pavement wasn’t programmed in to the system.”

&gt;Computers have yet to be taught to master situations of human interaction that are part of everyday driving – one driver gesturing to another to let him enter a lane, or flashing headlights to warn of danger.

&gt;There are other drawbacks. “It is very difficult for sensors to ascertain the softness of obstacles, like a plastic garbage bag by the road,” says Christian Gerdes, a professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford University.

&gt;At present, a self-driving car can’t distinguish reliably between a bag, a cardboard box and a pram in the road and would perform an emergency stop in each case, thereby possibly causing a rear-end collision.

418,Sidewinder77,"Have you seen the list of ""Really Great Articles and Reports"" in the sidebar? You might be able to get some other ideas there.

A few other random/obscure social implications from the coming increase in transportation freedom:

- **Greatly increased freedom of movement for oppressed groups.** For example, I'm thinking women who are banned from driving in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. In a very short time and without changing cultural and religious traditions, women will have the ability to travel as much as men
- **Lower unemployment.** There is plenty of concern about some short term unemployment caused from drivers that have to change jobs, but for the other 90% of the economy the increase in ability to be transported further/cheaper/faster will expand the available area that workers can apply for jobs. For example, for a poor person living in the inner city there could be many jobs that they qualify for in the suburbs. Currently they may not be able to afford their own car and transit could be too slow, preventing them from filling those jobs. Another example, residents of cities in the developing world that do not have access to any transportation could soon have quite a lot. Developing cities could leapfrog car ownership and go right to shared robotaxis. Billions of people could soon have access to be transported to much more productive and higher paying jobs. In the process trillions of dollars of new wealth will be created. 
- **A fleet of purpose built taxis.** With the ability to share a fleet of taxis, some portion of the cars can be small commuter vehicles, small group size, family size, etc. The number of empty seats in rush hour traffic would plummet. Road capacity could increase to the point that we could have overcapacity of roads in many instances.
- **Lower and higher density cities.** When cheap commuter cars become available many people and their families will choose to escape cities and move to the countryside. Many cities could see their densities fall considerably. On the other hand, large high density cities offer more opportunity and higher wages could become super-urban. As people gain the ability to more easily commute up to 100 miles away from commercial centers, some megacities could see [their population could double, triple, or more](http://nextbigfuture.com/2012/06/how-sky-cities-and-robotic-cars-will.html) as people flock to places that have the best opportunity and culture.
- **Reduced importance of municipal government.** Self driving taxis will make it easy to subsidize transportation for the poor and eliminate the need to run transit operations. Lower density countryside living will reduce crime and other negative externalities of density that urban planning and city governments aim to address. As a result, the need for city government services in some cities could fall.
- **Retail sector revolution.** Self driving cars will make it much easier for companies to deliver directly to you from distribution centers on demand. The process of distributing goods to local stores, unloading it, displaying it on shelves, and then checking it out at the till could be replaced by an automated distribution center that assembles your order, loads it into a self driving car, and sends your stuff to your door. A new model of retail could emerge with display stores that show you samples of what they sell, and then delivery of the products you choose when you get home. This new model would eliminate the need for much of the retail square footage in existence and free it up for other uses. In the case of items like clothing, cars with multiple styles/sizes could be sent allowing you to try on just the right item, and then return the surplus to the distribution center.",1381894359,ccsmojk,t3_1oiutf,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2013
419,mikitronz,"Even in the worst case, society wide safety improvements can be handled at a society wide level, including making changes to the law to do really anything you want. 

I would be interested in whether even in the case of say...some awful juries, some attempts at fraud where people try to get the car to do things that will hurt people without being liable themselves, and a few bad court decisions that don't get over turned for a while--I would be interested to see whether we could get federal liability coverage. 

The systems I am thinking of emulating are the ones in place today for medical countermeasures for chemical or biological attack and organ donation. Today, no company wants to make masks that it thinks will work well against chemical or biological attack because they'd be liable for huge amounts if it failed, and you can't exactly test it easily. But the government wants hospitals to have access to the masks that no one has invented (and doesn't want to just give out military equipment). So we set up a pile of money and said if any one sues after an attack and you weren't grossly negligent (e.g. ""yeah, just use felt for the mask. We're covered!"") you'd be able to use that pile of federal money to pay any judgement. Organs are allocated to those who are most likely to take advantage of the organs best. So we set up a panel of experts to say what a close match is, whether there should be bonus points for being a good citizen or being young, or negative points for having HIV or hepatitis, etc. There are political exceptions that get wrangled in like geographic non-medical considerations but for the most part we have a public, mostly open system to allocate organs. 

Governments could (only if in the very unlikely worst case of actual problems with implementation because of liability--which again I don't think will happen) apply these same ideas to self driving cars in several ways. Admittedly, this is also assuming Congress can pass anything, but setting politics aside... They could indemnifying private companies directly (if you have to pay out more than $x million we the government will reimburse you), or giving them a safe harbor by saying for example if you make the safety system open source and fix problems as the open source community asks you'll not be liable to judgement, or only liable for X or Y. They could set up a panel of ethics experts, software developers, driving experts(?) etc. to determine what the car should do in case X Y and Z. Once the car knows there will be an accident, should it protect occupants over pedestrians? Lots of pedestrians? Lots of children pedestrians?

422,PaulGodsmark,"To help understand just how much this will affect our daily lives I suggest that people walk themselves through a typical day but imagine where self-driving cars/vehicles (SDCs) will affect how the day progresses.

SDCs will affect where and how we live and work.

An easy to understand example is the health service and impacts there.  Currently around 25% of emergency room admissions are car crash related.  So with SDCs the demand for critical care facilities and staff will see a steady reduction.

Also, needs confirming, but perhaps as much as 90% of tissue and organ donation comes from car crash fatalities - with each fatality benefitting something like 50 recipients.  As SDCs cause road crashes to steadily fall then the entire foundation of the existing organ and tissue donation system comes into question.  We can only hope that technological and medical advancements in other areas make up for this change.

As increasing numbers of people start to live in self-driving RV's and mobile homes, so we will have travelling communities set up - that don't pay property taxes and follow the weather around the continent as part of their transient lifestyle.  The health and other social services will have to adapt in some way to support these communities - perhaps the public sector will pay people to travel with these communities and support (and police?) them?

With the potential for Automated Vehicle Zones in urban centres we would see an incredible change in how the central business district operates and significant overall benefits to residents and businesses there.  This could happen as soon as 2023 in North America according to my admittedly optimistic calculations - but possibly 2020 in an island state like Singapore.

Energy companies will need to rapidly prepare for increased electricity generation and distribution as SDCs will be the final catalyst, if one is needed, for Electric Vehicles (EV) to become mainstream - particularly in urban centres.

Sleeping overnight in the vehicle and waking at your destination will become normal and will significantly impact business and family interactions.

With the potential for SDC automated taxi fleets then the potential for Zero-Occupancy Vehicles is huge - but this will then facilitate very cheap home deliveries.  Expect less trips to the shops - and more trips where the shops come to you.

With parking requirements in city centers steadily dropping expect battles between businesses seeking to re-develop such prime real-estate becoming available, and those seeking to use the land to benefit the community and to improve quality of life - e.g. city centre parks contained within old multi-storey parking structures.",1381934796,ccsv65q,t3_1oiutf,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2013

That's where precast comes in - as a factory built pavement, we can drop a sensor harness into the pavement during casting, then just plug it in when it's delivered to the site, which means we can build smart roads even faster than current methods can build traditional ""dumb"" roads. 

We're currently working with a number of sensor providers to embed their products into a robust multi-feature sensor network for our pavement systems.

Not really. Prices are comparable to existing pavement systems, and actually save about 80% across the pavement life. 

&gt;That sounds like a nightmare for the UK, as we have very little slabbing.

The finished pavement meets or exceeds all existing standards for ride quality. Our pavements have less than 1/4"" variance across 25', or less than 6.5mm variance across 7.5m. 

&gt;Also if adoption is to be as fast as possible, I feel that this method you take more than 10 years depending on the State. I am not sure if people want a 'patch quilt' effect, where the cars would only be allowed in certain areas?

The market leader in driverless, Google, only intends to provide their driverless service in select areas, due to the difficulty of keeping the Street View up to date, which is required for their version of driverless. 

&gt;I wonder if somehow you can integrate IR codes (those new square bar codes), into or next to the road markings, or IR codes integrated into the sides of the pavements. Or put IR codes within the 'Cat's Eyes' housing - that's what we call the reflectors built into the road in the UK.

We do plan to integrate ""IR codes"", but in our case, IR stands for Integrated Roadways. I think you mean QR codes.

&gt;For the record, I hope we have as little infrastructure needed for Level 4 cars as possible. I believe for cost and security reasons that the Level 4 car should be as independent as possible.

There is currently no such thing as an ""independent"" self-driving vehicle. Google's self-driving vehicles currently cost nearly $400K - the base vehicle, plus $350K equipment, and this would work only in select areas. Even with incorporation of Moore's Law, we're still looking at $15K or so for driverless, and again, only in select areas. 

Mercedes plans to provide driverless options in its top tier vehicles for $1K in 2020, but hasn't explained how. 

I don't know how the UK pays for roads, but in the USA, we primarily use fuel taxes. I could go into the problems with fuel taxes, but suffice to say, the system hasn't worked, and driverless will exacerbate the problem, especially electric or alternative fuel driverless, because there would be no driver contribution to roadway upkeep. No taxation method that I've heard for EVs or alt fuel is functional. 

The appeal of putting the driverless into the pavement is that instead of one person paying for the equipment, all the subscribers are paying for the equipment, and far less equipment is needed because people can share the expensive parts - would you rather pay $15K for an options package, or $200 for an options package then $0.05 / mile for driverless service? It would require you to drive 300K miles (482K km) to make up the price difference. 

Seeing as how most people prefer to subsidize the cost of their cell phone, I'd suggest that most people would also prefer to subsidize the cost of their driverless equipment by sharing that cost among thousands of other users to reduce their up-front and long-term costs.

Why do you think we have to have sensors in the pavement? - Why can't we use the V2V and V2I technology currently being developed in Ann Arbor?  (Which the fully self-driving car (SDC) doesn't need anyway but is a great complementary technology).

Why do you assume that Google will only operate in select areas? - are you aware of the desire to standardize the highway asset data collection through organizations like the [GTMA](http://www.usgtma.org/about_us)?  - we can expect that within the next 4 years more and more of the highway asset data collection that each US State carries out as part of their structured and scheduled highway maintenance programs using LiDAR will be in a form that can be converted for use by SDCs.  So it won't be only Google that is producing this SDC mapping data. Plus the SDCs themselves when driven by a person will be able to collect route LiDAR data on the first manual drive-thorugh that will then inform future automated passage. i.e. drive once, be verified for safety, and then it is in the database for automated use thereafter.

You assume costs of the SDC down to a premium of $15,000 - yet there is  growing evidence that the key sensor, the LiDAR will move from $70k now to around $500 or less by 2017.  Ibeo have already said that they will be providing lower spec LiDAR for $250 dollars next year.  Google are on record as saying that they think their tech will add a couple of thousand dollars to a regular vehicle on a production line that already has most of the other sensors needed. Plus LiDAR sensor tech is also developing rapidly and new forms are being researched which would be magnitudes cheaper than the existing ones even in prototype form.

- no drivers cutting into your bike lane or doing other stupid stuff
 
- prevention of driver opening car door when parked if cyclist is nearby

- not having to slow down at red light

- cars can take aggressive evasive maneuvers if you pull into their path. 

On this last point - this, I think is a huge win for self-driving vehicles, on three points:  
 
- They can continuously monitor, precisely, the trajectory of all surrounding vehicles, whereas human drivers generally only look out front, and occasionally in the mirrors if they feel like it.

- They can be programmed with the handling characteristics of the vehicle, so they can take [aggressive evasive maneuvers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=t9Fxp3HK6DI#t=26) to avoid other vehicles. They will know exactly how hard they can brake, or steer to avoid skids, where human drivers very rarely practice these. 

- They can communicate with other vehicles to let them know they are about to take evasive maneuvers.

How long have these systems been used? I imagine in a few years, there WILL be failures. Although in their case, it will probably be more of an issue of it causing a minor fender bender or simply not work. You can't have that kind of failure in an autonomous car because ""not working"" means there *will* be an accident. There is *very little* margin for error in an automated car.

&gt;Google's Self Driving Car has driven hundreds of thousands of miles autonomously and the only accidents have been the result of human mistakes, not the machine.

This is not a fair comparison because it is just one vehicle being monitored by a team of engineers and computer scientists keeping it in operating condition. It probably was never *allowed* to crash.

If you take that same google car and send it around America for 5-10 years unsupervised with only regular maintenance (gas, oil, etc), would you still have the same faith in it working reliably.

We're talking about an entire nation full of automated vehicles, vehicles which simply cannot be ""run into the ground"" because when they fail, there will be an accident.

The fully self-driving car (SDC) will just be the first truly 'autonomous' robot that will physically affect most people's daily lives.

It is far from perfect - but it's definitely one of the better papers that I have see and coming from Eno should see a lot of media attention. Which I think is a good thing.

I agree with some great points from e4e6, and echo the sentiments that this is a great paper for raising awareness and sounding a (albeit minor) alarm call within government.  Hopefully more businesses will catch the notion that it is not going to be business as usual.

The paper is very much written from a transportation viewpoint, which is fair enough as it would have to be much longer to cover the wider spectrum of implications, but even that is a vast subject area and it cannot begin to give the depth that is eventually is going to be needed.

Quoting the Shaheen, UC Berkeley car sharing figures of 9 to 14 without using the original source was a bit strange.  Plus I don't agree that SDCs will achieve 9 to 14 - I much prefer Kornhauser's, Princeton, figures of around 2 to 3 regular vehicles being replaced by a SDC. 

The costs of the tech is a hard one to deal with - but the fact that with four years to possible public deployment that Ibeo can be selling lower standard LiDAR units to an automaker for $250 each next year - combined with the research and development that I know about in the LiDAR and sensor space - then I find the cost figures to definitely be on the conservative side.  The Velodyne LiDAR probably cost $70k 4 years ago - and only costs so much now because of economies of scale and because they don't seem to have an active sensor development and update cycle.

The whole platooning side I take issue with - the figures I have seen have a maximum fuel efficiency of 14% gain - but the average for all vehicles in a 5 or 6 vehicle platoon is less than 10%.  PLUS - the following vehicles have all sorts of road debris thrown up at them by the lead vehicle and suffer considerable windscreen, body panel and radiator damage as a result.  One day platooning will work well - just not with current vehicle shapes and the size gaps that are being tested.

&gt;""40% of fatal crashes are caused by [four specific kinds of human error]."" Well that is nice but there are several reasons this isn't the right statistic.

This isn't a fair way to frame this benefit. What percentage of *all* accidents are *not avoided by* or are caused by *any* human action? Also, serious injury accidents matter to society just like fatalities (perhaps more if there is permanent disability). If that accident were caused by black ice on a sunny morning it wouldn't be human error (let alone inattention etc. specifically) but a self driving car could take warning from a car losing traction ahead. So the benefits to accrue are much more substantial than this 40% figure. 

&gt;""Or maybe they'll lead to a fresh wave of suburban sprawl and increase air pollution.""

This author of this article makes this statement while linking to an article by...himself. The article in one breath tries to link a scarier environmental situation (due to a potential for increased urban sprawl and decreased public transportation due in turn to more ""drivers"", but at the core of those concerns are the idea that new drivers on the road and homes farther from an urban core result in more pounds of carbon and other impacts that wouldn't otherwise be put into the environment. The citations in these articles typically conclude the opposite: that yes Timmy the 13 year old can get to the mall (or even the more fun mall across town) in a car and not on a bus, but a longer distance or a trip in a vehicle less fuel efficient  than a bus is no where near as important as the platooning, smooth acceleration, parking finding, and life cycle environmental benefits offered by self driving cars--especially when you realize that those trips generally take place today anyway. We don't poll 13 year olds on the number of trips to the mall they take, and you can't ask someone how many trips they didn't take.

The article also says that it would be environmentally damaging because the additional use of cars (today only used 10 or 20 percent if the day) would mean faster replacement. 
  
*  That is like saying taxis will never be popular because everyone paying for all those rides would wear the car out. 

Additional use means two or more people are using one car, which means efficiency gains both in terms of capital productivity (the household can buy other things with the money not spent on a second or third car--including a more expensive first car) and in terms of having your car die not because it was 20 years old and the hoses were getting stiff, but because of _actual use_. Obviously, higher utilization can also mean inter-household, so if you do replace your car faster, but you do so as part of your shared car with the other members of your cul de sac then there will be less financial impact in any case. The counterfactual is two or more cars, not one person sitting at home. blah blah blah feature not a bug.

The article says the **sensors are expensive today** on prototype cars. Yes, and the prototype Tesla was expensive too-but the sales price today doesn't appear to mean the death of the brand. Prototypes are [not](Http://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2013/01/11/high-sensor-costs-wont-stand-in-the-way-of-the-self-driving-future/) valid cost comparison tools.

So prices will come down on all transported products because there is competition and there are real alternatives.

Self driving cars will be much more fuel efficient than regular cars for several reasons: they can be lighter without the giant safety system needed when humans smash cars into each other; they don't slam on the gas and the brakes like humans do; they don't look for parking all day (estimates go as high as 40% of urban fuel spent here); and they can take themselves to be maintained (and this may be required by manufacturers for insurance purposes if they are the ones who end up being liable).

1.  Self-driving cars will not make driving errors.
2.  Self-driving cars will never be in accidents because they're perfect drivers.

Those are not the same thing.  There can still be a whole lot of accidents involving self-driving cars.  Yes, they'll have fewer than with human drivers, but car accidents won't just go away.  Because a car can get into an accident as a result of things OTHER than errors caused by *the driver of that car.*

Real life includes humans and they can do stupid things that exceed even a computer's super-human ability to avoid accidents. 

There was a drunk driving case where someone jumped out from behind a guardrail, at night, in dark colored clothing and got run over.  The driver was acquitted because no one, no matter how sober, would have been able to avoid the accident.  (He was acquitted for fleeing the scene because he was drunk and didn't know he'd hit someone!)  A human driver cannot be expected to defy the laws of physics even when the law demands it, and neither can a computer.  

A self-driving car will not operate in a vacuum (unless it's the pod on a hyperloop.)  But instead in the messy, fucked up, dangerous world we live in.

And the super-human discipline of self-drive may make a lot of situations worse.  A self-driving car is the ultimate in anti-lock brakes, so if a small tree limb falls in the road, it's going to stop faster than any human possibly could.  But that includes the distracted human in the car behind the self-driving car.

Another example:  In the US, anyone who consistently obeys speed limits is just asking for a road rage attack.  This would make a nice scene in some kind of thriller movie.  Picture a family being gunned down in their car on a remote road, then the car pulls up at a house full of dead people and says in a bubbly voice, ""We have arrived.

481,HipsterCosmologist,"&gt; That means the emitted beam will take 500 ns (in a vacuum) to come back.

Let me see if I can do zeroth order attempt at estimating the probability of an interaction here:

*  .5 millionth of a second window. Let's say that's 1:2e6 odds that two equidistant sensors pointed at the same place would be doing so at the same time.
* As a wild guess, let's say the area the sensor is detecting measures 1 square arcmin.  There's ~= 1.5e8 arcmin in a sphere, but we can probably round down to 1e8 because the sensor only covers a cylinder.
* Combining these, we could say roughly the odds are 1:2e14 at any given moment.  Perhaps subtract a couple orders of magnitude since LIDAR can sweep the same area multiple times a second.
* If we tack on a ""wave-form space"" that obviously adds a huge factor

So yeah, an admittedly tiny probability. 

However, I don't think it tells the whole story.  The reason I say that is, if we have two exactly identical cars with the same spin-rate LIDAR, the question then becomes: are any two systems ever in sync geometrically?  In that case, they could generate consistent blind spots for one another. 

Imagine three lanes of traffic with closely packed self driving cars, all maintaining fairly consistent distances to each other.  If we reuse the 150m range term, and we say 1 car per 10m of lane as a placeholder value -- That's 90 cars you could interact with at any given moment.  This adds a combinatorial term in which would be in favor of an interaction.  I won't venture a guess at it though.

What I am imagining are small zones of interference which could phase into and out of existence.  

Having typed all that up though, I do see what you are saying about a unique hopping scheme acting to largely mitigate the problem.  Even if they happened to be in sync through a few cycles, the probability of a further interaction after they performed a random hop is is very low.

Aside from bad weather handing, it seems like handling massive amounts of distributed information is in line with Google's core competence.

2,Sidewinder77,"To try and answer your questions:

1) The long-term vision of many people for self-driving cars is a fully autonomous vehicle that does not need a human to interact with or drive the car in any way at any time. Cars like that could transport someone who can't see, a child that does not have the ability to drive, or inanimate goods that need to be delivered.

2) Right now laws that exist in some states require self-driving cars that are being tested to have someone in the drivers seat. As the computer driver gets better, a human driver will not be required. Eventually many vehicles may not even have a drivers seat.

3) Self-driving cars do not yet exist for consumer use, but when they do you'll likely be able to drink while being transported by the computer driver.

4) I'm not sure medical insurance 'should' cover transportation, but I'm sure that once this technology is commercialized the price will rapidly fall. It will become extremely easy to subsidize transportation in self-driving taxis for the poor and those who cannot drive. Google is aiming to commercialize self-driving cars by 2017. If they work well by that time, I expect them to be in heavy use in the early 2020's and completely ubiquitous in world transportation by 2030.

In the UK we have a significant traveller population (Irish, Roma etc) and there are plenty of regulations covering things like sites it's permissible to park on, how to access local services without a permanent address and taxes. Many other European countries have similar populations and regulations. So there is a pretty good precedent for travelling people, self driving RVs won't make a big difference. If it did become popular just borrow some regulations from countries with a history of travellers.

One thing to mention though is there is often a lot of tension between travellers and settled people. Xenophobia against travellers is very common and mainstream, newspapers frequently report on problems with traveller sites (be it rubbish, crime etc) and people often swap anecdotes along those lines. Managing these tensions also has to be taken into consideration.",1393847717,cft5gad,t1_cft52qk,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2014
9,ahfoo,"I think something along these lines is highly likely. There are a number of things that I doubt people are looking at which come together to make this more doable. 

It's natural to assume that such a thing would require hauling a lot of water for one but I don't think so. You can pull potable water directly out of the air but more importantly is the changing nature of grey/black wastewater technology. This is dramatically changing because of LED technology. UVC water sterilizers are just beginning to ovetake gas discharge lamps and the implications are huge for wastewater systems. 

There is already a prototype shower system that recycles 90% of the water so quickly that it also retains the heat. Such systems are naturally suited to space constrained applications where minimizing on water storage is also important. 

If you've got a shower and a bed in an autonomous car then you don't need a kitchen as long as you have a place to get healthy food on the road. The basic premise of drive-through food is already in place. The problem is that so far most drive-through food is not really that healthy but there are signs that is changing. For instance at In-N-Out Burger they offer burgers wrapped with lettuce instead of buns. Nutritionally, that's not a bad way to go on the road. 

So I don't know about an RV as such but a place to eat and sleep certainly. That doesn't have to be a large vehicle at all. One obvious approach is what is traditionally called cab-over design. If you Google image search that  you see that it usually refers to big trucks with a very tall profile. Tall vehicles are problematic unless you have an excellent center of gravity. That's one of the huge advantages of an electric vehicle, you can place all the batteries right on the floor keeping the center of gravity low. 

If you go up instead of out, it's easy to see how you can have plenty of space for a bed and shower in the space of a vehicle. With such a vehicle you wouldn't necessarily need to affect the real estate market because you could just move out further and further from the expensive real estate and assume you'd drive in to work even if it took several hours.  In the long run that would no doubt have an effect on real estate and it would simply escalate the trend towards sprawl if left unchecked.

It wouldn't have to be that way though. I suspect that self-driving cars would have so many effects on society that they would be alter real estate prices for various reaons. My main point is simply that bathrooms are probably easier than they seem due to other technologies that are also emerging at the same time.

That isn't any different than now, where the consumer shoulders the cost of insurance, but right now the consumer is also the one with the greatest degree of control over safety since they drive the car, so the incentive to drive safely is with the consumer. However, with self-driving cars, that locus of control shifts to the manufacturer, so in my view, so should the insurance. 

We want insurance to be paid for by the least cost avoider. The least cost avoider is the one with the highest degree of control over safety. The group with the highest degree of control over safety in a world of driverless cars is going to be the manufacturer.

It's entirely irrelevant to the future of computing. Why do you think there is so little room for innovation in cars? It's ridiculous.

&gt; Big auto is already looking for every way possible to save a nickel. Why do you think the human component of manufacturing is removed?

No they are not. The disruption is coming from outside. The big automakers are very conservative and slow to change. If anything, automakers and dealers will be the ones campaigning against self driving cars.

The human component is being removed because it's such a big cost. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but when you buy a car from GM thousands of dollars go to pay for healthcare and pension of current and former workers. A start up company that doesn't have a workforce has a huge advantage. 

Look what happened to self-driving cars once Google started working on them. Well, now they are working on robotics as are Apple and a bunch of other tech companies.

66,SFTGFOP,"Here's a few points I'd like to see:

1. Let's keep the regulations light. We shouldn't expect self-driving cars to be perfect because they're replacing an imperfect technology. If we get them on the roads, competitive pressures will make them improve quickly. They're not replacing a perfect technology. Manually driven cars suffer tire blowouts, mechanical failures, drivers falling asleep, drivers not paying attention, and so many more issues that cause accidents and cost lives. Self driving cars should have some safety protocols built in to deal with things like tire blowouts or even software failures (for example: pulling over and calling a tow truck), but let's let the markets sort these out. People will pick the safer option, and fear of liability will make producers refine their safety protocols.

2. Let's start with the assumption that there need be no human control in driverless cars. Let's stick with the assumption that the rider/s is/are playing pokemon, sleeping, or otherwise occupied. That's where the ultimate promise of driverless car technology is, so let's direct it there. Don't think of driverless cars as replacing personal cars, but as replacing buses. Buses rob millions of poor people of additional hours of their lives every day. Every day that we don't have driverless vans that can dynamically route people to their destinations, lifetimes are wasted sitting on buses.

3. Can we sell speed-passes? The freeway and highway speed limits are artificially low in order to generate ticket revenue. Can we just prepay $150 a year for the right to go as fast as we want. That would allow driverless cars to operate in normal traffic by matching currently illegal human driving speeds. 

4. Let's use rich people as guinea pigs. If you make it legal for people in driverless cars to sleep through their commutes, we'll likely get fully autonomous vehicles in the luxury end of the market first. You don't have to over-regulate those cars. Luxury brands will take care of their high end customers. Are Mercedes, Lexus, or Tesla going to let a bunch of their wealthiest customers crash and die? No, they're going to make damned sure that they're safe and comfortable. Then their refinements to safety and reliability will pass down to the mass market. Also, once rich people do it, people get over their fears and prejudices.


Overall, my main point is that people are dying or having their lives drained away now. So long as driverless cars kill proportionately fewer people, we come out ahead. For every day you delay the point where anyone can Uber up a carpool van to take them home from the bars cheap, the blood of drunk drivers and exhausted commuters is on your hands.

Once the car enters the ""Autonomous Lane"" an RFID can ping to the car that it is allowed to go into Autonomous mode. An operator in the car would agree to a prompt in the vehicle, and the payment system for the current HOV could remain.

72,another_old_fart,"Based on the outline document it seems clear that the DMV is looking at self-driving capability as a traditional form of autopilot - a mechanism that can operate the car partially or totally, but can be disengaged by a human operator. This assumption would obviously demand that a licensed driver be in the car at all times, or that the automation must be fully capable of parking the car in a safe place before giving up control. 

In any case, the cars visualized in this document must have a full set of accessible controls for manual operation. This requirement is understandably short-term, but eventually the law will have to address technology that is designed not to require any driver at all, and does not even provide manual controls other than an emergency ""stop"" command that compels the car to safely stop. Since all occupants in such advanced cars will be passengers, regulations will have to let go of the traditional concept of an operator who is responsible for the car's actions. A car with this level of automation will function more like an elevator - a passenger will merely tell it where to go. 

Regulations will eventually have to cope with this level of technology, which the engineers tell us is only a few years away.

I think a really promising idea is borrowing from the aviation industry with the transition from yoke to centre/side-sticks and more complex fly-by-wire systems. 

Just like the autopilot of an airplane, if the car's 'autopilot' should fail an alarm could sound and manual control could be taken over. Additionally, any input from the manual control sets should override the autopilot controls similar to how cruise control works in cars right now. 

I also think the next step in autonomous driving will be something more akin to how aviation autopilot evolved. For instance, cars would be able to be switched to 'auto' only on approved roads, like highways or interstates, where simpler driving conditions exist, just like how early autopilots could maintain a course but not land a plane. 

It would be interesting to see certain stretches of road, or types of road, studied for their candidacy as the first places cars could be allowed to drive themselves. 

I think the gradual transition from sometimes self driving, to completely self driving will also help to solve issues that we are currently discussing, like liability and extreme weather management, and also show us problems we haven't thought of yet through experience.

77,hak8or,"&gt; There need to be regulations against hacking or tampering with the car's software or hardware/sensors. It would probably be sufficient to place liability on the hacker for any accident... in other words, if the certified manufacturer's software fails, it's their fault, but if you change the software and it fails, it's your fault.


Wait wait. Tampering with hardware sensors I do agree with, but the control software must be open source and available for others to tamper with. Yes, if an accident happens and it is deemed to be the fault of the modified firmware then the owner of the vehicle should be considered at fault. But it should still be allowed.

As always with large software projects at large companies, there will be many holes in the software both in terms of usability and design. It being open source will allow users to fix these flaws and the companies to see the changes and then merge these changes to their own. 

There is absolutely no reason for companies to reimplement how to handle a red light ten ways and waste their time. Allow companies to work off each others progress so we can get the software to a fairly nice state as soon as possible. The concept of a driverless car is too important to let one company hire some fresh CS grads to implement lane detection poorly tarnishing the image for many years. 

Not to mention, it being open source will allow constant audits and lighting quick fixes in the event a security flaw is found. We don't want garbage like Sony's ""random"" number generator consisting of just spitting out six over and over in a system like this.

Separate the control software and interface software to a point where throwing garbage at the control software from the interface software won't cause the vehicle to crash. This would allow users to use their own UI to the system such as graphical user interfaces, different voices for status updates, and even possibly different hardware attachments like larger screens being able to be installed by the user painlessly, all without having to tamper with the control software. This would allow constant attempts to make the interface better by third parties and therefore allow the technology to continue further as painlessly as possible. For example, a third party could integrate a really slick looking statistics page for your vehicle, so at the end of the day you can see exactly where you drove at what time, what the traffic was like, how much fuel was lost due to traffic, and other stats for data junkies like myself.

Most importantly, have the DMV make a series of tests which the software must always pass. There will be different implementations of the control software in the beginning regardless, so have the DMV make a few test scenarios. But these tests should both be done in hardware, meaning a physical track and a physical car, and in software so the customer can test the control software him/herself after purchase, with the tests being available to the public. The software tests, a simulation using logic dictated by the control software, would allow those who want to improve the control software a test bed to see how their changes work in simulation. This would lower the barrier for those who want to improve the software by allowing them to not only actually change the software but also test it, which is most certainly a good thing.

TLDR; 
The software end of a self driving car should be just as well regulated as the vehicle itself. Separate control logic from the user interface so users can do as they please with the interface without the issue of ""tampering with the software"" and allowing third parties to improve the interfaces beyond what the original automotive manufactures will do. Have it be open source so everyone who wants can do security audits at any time and any critical security issues can be patched in a timely manner. It being open source will also allow others to fix whatever the automotive manufacturers either forgot, designed poorly, or just didn't do for whatever reason. Make a software test for the control logic so users can test it themselves for peace of mind while also having a easy to use test bed for proposed changes to the control logic.

The car owners insurance prices would then take on any risk assosiated with how good/bad a self driving system is.

80,mutatron,"I think self driving cars shouldn't be allowed on the road until they can deal with unfavorable conditions better than humans, and I don't think that's going to be very far off.

Currently we have cruise control, anti-lock braking, self-parking, systems that alert you when you're out of your lane, etc., so there's a little bit of automation already going on.

When I think of self driving cars though, I think of [Boston Dynamics](http://www.bostondynamics.com/). If it's possible to make a robot that can prevent you from knocking it over, and that can adjust its gait to varying terrain, you can make a car that can figure out how to drive itself in any conditions.

It's all about making an adaptable system that learns how to drive, rather than making a system where all cases are already handled in software. Once you get one car that has learned how to drive, you can clone its knowledge into other cars.

The systems I'm thinking about would be able to drive with a minimum of road markings, and would know that they have to slow down in certain situations. They would experiment with various strategies when driving in unfavorable conditions, learning the limits to speed and traction in slippery conditions.

In the most difficult or confusing situations, they should be able to respond to voice command, or maybe have some paddle controls for human guidance, but they shouldn't have steering wheels or brakes directly accessible to humans, because by then most people will have forgotten how to use those safely.",1394228273,cfx0vz6,t3_1zu8gi,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2014

83,ferlessleedr,"People make car-bombs as it is.  It's several thousand pounds of high-velocity steel, so it's pretty dangerous in the hands of somebody who wants it to be, or is extremely careless.

Self-Driving Cars might actually *improve* this situation though.  Certainly they would severely decrease the danger from careless drivers because human emotions would no longer interrupt decision-making processes (tl:dr; no more teenagers being stupid).

These systems would need to have ways of ""seeing"" pedestrians and other objects that aren't actively alerting the car to their location and so it would presumably have some form of sensor suite and programming complex designed around avoiding objects and pedestrians, essentially ""seeing"" the car's environment.  There would also be programming blocks around things like going off the road or into buildings other than parking ramps and similar.

As is if I want to drive my car into a crowded restaurant I can, the only block will be the sidewalk and the wall.  If I wanted my driverless car to do so, however, I would have to somehow convince it to do so by altering it's programming.  Possible, sure.  Difficult, though.

Now certainly with a large enough explosive device a road would be close enough to my target to do serious damage.  With some kind of small thermonuclear device I merely need to tell my driverless car to just drive through the city and then press the button at the right time.  However this isn't actually that much more difficult than doing so right now - hire a point to point courier service.  Place a GPS tag on the device in question.  Tell them to deliver this pallet from some anonymous warehouse to a location near ground zero and monitor the GPS tag from a coffee shop well outside the blast radius.

So basically you need to somehow overcome the fact that the driverless car won't actually let you get close to your target, either by getting around the programming blocks (and it will probably get stuck anyways because you have put it in a situation well outside it's programming) or by getting a device of such power that your efforts to build it will likely be noticed by authorities monitoring the materials you'll need.

Let's not forget that Timothy McVeigh was NOT a suicide bomber.  He drove a van up to the Oklahoma Federal Building and just left it there.  He didn't need a driverless car to deliver his device, it happened in our current system.  There are many other similar stories.

88,DigitalEvil,"There was a big bout of talk toward this a year ago when a UK research group announced a ""learning"" autonomous vehicle prototype that could drive in snow, ice, and rain. You can find the link below talking about it on kurzweilai (amazing site).

Anyways, teaching a basic system how to react to environmental factors would be a fairly easy thing to solve in theory (maybe a little bit more so in practice, but not terribly I'm my thoughts). The basics of autonomous vehicles today use a mixture of lasers, video, and GPS for their ""senses"" of the world around them and a back end computer program to teach them how to respond and react to the readings from their senses. Using that system along side with additional sensors (temperature, humidity, etc) you could easily develop a driving system fitting for weather hazards.

Examples:

It's raining, your car is equipped with a weather sensor, it reads the barometric pressure, humidity, and temperature. When sensors on the car recognize that it is raining, the program can run a background program that dictates basic driving standards different than when it is sunny outside (is: slow down 5 mph, account for further distance to vehicles to account for traction, etc).

If the temperature drops further, it could sense the risk of ice on the road and adjust even more, further decreasing speeds, etc. Hit a patch of ice and start skidding while your tires lock up? The vehicle's standard systems could alert the computer and initiate emergency reaction maneuvers statistically proven to best assist in those situations.

Naturally, this isn't based entirely in reality. There are many factors that would need to be addressed first, namely visibility for the guidance systems (video and laser). But if planes can do it through their systems for weather, the basic tech is there just need to adapt it appropriately.

I liked the idea of the UK car because it basically ""learned"" the human driver's habits and not just relied on preprogrammed responses.

With technology at a point where enforcement could be perfect (speed cameras), laws that anticipate arbitrary and erratic enforcement are obsolete. I just don't want liability issues to force self-driving vehicles to drive dangerously slow or to impede traffic. 

I think that a mandatory communication protocol would encumber the rollout of self-driving vehicles and limit their usefulness. Some car companies have pushed for them, and I think that it's a stalling tactic because they're not ready to compete in a world of self-driving cars. Imagine that you require a mandatory communication protocol:
1. First, various companies squabble over what the standards will be. Years go by.
2. Once its been hammered out, infrastructure needs to be built. Now you've got an imbalance: not enough self-driving cars on the road to justify a major investment / not enough infrastructure upgraded to justify self-driving cars. So this hampers rollout. 
3. Self-driving cars only make sense where the infrastructure exists. Your rural residence has an un-updated dirt driveway that the car refuses to use. Also, if cars rely on the infrastructure, you've got a central pinch point through which your entire transportation system can fail. 
  Ultimately you want an adaptable system that can take you everywhere that your personal car can take you. You need your car to be able to deal with objects that don't talk, like manual cars, tumbleweeds, and deer. 


Alternatively, how about we let cars talk, and or broadcast and have other car manufacturers adapt. Toyota vehicles start broadcasting their actions via wifi or through wireless internet, and other manufacturers train their cars how to use those broadcasts. Even if not everyone can agree on a standard, it's still in their interest to give their car the ability to understand all the information available to it. 


To add a 5. to my list: Allow the docking of moving vehicles. 
  Self-driving cars should be able to perfectly match speeds. That means you could, for example, run a bus from San Diego to San Francisco that never stops. Local feeder vans could pick up passengers at their homes, dock with the bus on the freeway, and exchange outgoing passengers with passengers looking to get off locally.

We were all quickly put inside other family cars and driven to the closest ER. That probably saved my father's life.

And so I think that self-driving car manufacturers should try and allow their cars to detect an accident. 

The cars should contact the police and if possible even send them videos of what they see. If the car is empty, then it might even be worth making it stop to potentially allow a stranger to get inside. And if that happens, the car should definitely contact the police. 

And if the person asks to be taken to a hospital, then if the empty car was not carrying organs for transplant, we probably should allow it to take them to a hospital. We should even consider allowing any car going to a hospital for an emergency to violate the speed limit, imitate the sound of an ambulance, and communicate wirelessly with other cars to make way.

Imagine a cow on that dirt road, it's not going to have a communicator, so the car is going to have to assume it could run out in front of it as it drives by. However if it were, say a car parked on the side of the road, with a  communicator, saying ""I'm here, but I can't tell you anything"", your car can assume that it's going to stay at rest as you pass (or it'll warn you that it's starting to move or whatever). 

And these types of protocols tend to be created and heavily influenced by the early production individuals, because they have the most experience, and other people get more benefit from their early product. What will most likely happen is the google car program will create a communication protocol, and that with minor tweaks will become the standard protocol that others can build on (much like XML was built out of the html standard, and there are all sorts of ""sub-products"" each with their own special twist on XML but all conforming to the same basic rules.

I'm not driving with a gamepad, but fine, if someone wants to, that's okay. My problem is that regardless of the interface, it will be a drive-by-wire connection to the car itself, with an automated steering rack, brakes, and electronic throttle. In between you and that hardware will be a computer running software under someone else's control.

&gt; At any rate it's the same difference either way. Either you can hack your way around it or you can't.

Like I said above, look at Ukraine. Put things in context. You may not have months with a logic scope and time to figure out a means of bypassing a car's government locks.

I'm not saying this is going to happen to you or me in our happy homes, but worldwide, these are issues people will be facing eventually. Governments try to shut down the Internet, power, hell, even water...

107,DifferentFrogs,"&gt;For £50bn the UK could have 3,333,333 shared fleet vehicles at a cost of £15,000 each.

That's somewhat disingenuous. Part of the reason high-speed rail is being pushed is because the roads are *already* at capacity. Shared fleets won't fix that problem - in fact they'll exacerbate it. If you want more cars, you're going to have to upgrade your highways and inner-city roads too, and neither of those come cheap.

The other issue is that shared fleet vehicles, like self-driving cars, are the kind of product the private market excels at introducing and producing. The market will also ensure that they are introduced at the right time and take on the burden of risk (the government can nudge them along with subsidies and regulatory improvements if they want to), so it's not the sort of thing the government needs to spend £50bn on.

On the other hand, if the government does spend that £50bn on a shared fleet of cars then there will be NO high-speed rail. Building huge infrastructure projects with 50-year returns-on-investment is NOT something the private market is good at. And while I'm a huge proponent of self-driving cars, I think in the *very* long-term (40+ years down the line) we are going to need to start reducing individual vehicle use and move into more sustainable (and faster) transport alternatives like rail.

[Britain's roads are over-congested and at capacity](http://www.mirror.co.uk/features/britain-busiest-most-congested-roads-3158325).This problem will not be significantly alleviated [until the **majority** of car owners have self-driving vehicles](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/car-life/how-self-driving-cars-will-ease-traffic-congestion/article15876882/) which will take around 30 years at the earliest. Also I'll need a number for that 11% - my source here says that you'll see a doubling in capacity at best. The source also mentions that *""congestion will improve as self-driving cars are introduced, but that the most dramatic change will occur when autonomous vehicles take over completely, eliminating the variables of human drivers.""*

&gt;High speed rail is an old technology that hasn't progressed much if at all in 30 years.  

That's because the technology is already pretty good. The only reason it's slightly inefficient fuel wise (and bear in mind that it's still much more efficient on a per-person-moved basis) is because the trains go so fast. People value time. If you don't give them high-speed rail they will use airplanes. Self-driving cars will not be faster than people-driven ones until people-driven cars are removed from the road completely.

&gt;Your problem is that you view cars and all their flaws in the current paradigm. Full automation changes the paradigm.

Your problem is that full automation is not coming for 30 years or more. The money just isn't there to give every person a self-driving car, and it won't be there for some time.

I was looking forward to your post but given the quality of your comments to-date and your endless ad-hominems, I'm no longer expecting much.

Since it falls to me, once again, to address the point at hand, let me list the reasons why all the cars in the UK - all 30 million of them - will NOT be completely autonomous by 2044:

1. Mass-produced, communicating-with-other-vehicles, upgradable self-driving cars are not going to be on the market for another 10 years. Yes, self-driving cars [http://business.time.com/2012/08/16/self-driving-cars-available-by-2019-report-says/] will be available by 2019. But *cheap* ones? Ones that communicate with ALL other driverless vehicles on a universal regulatory standard? Ones that people want to buy and are convinced are good value? It beggers belief that those will arrive any sooner than 10 years after THAT.

2. Even when those types of cars *do* go on sale, people will still be buying people-driven cars. Or even if they aren't, even if in 15 years NO-ONE is buying people-driven cars (a stretch of the imagination to say to least), there will still be people-driven cars on the road for *at least* another 10 years after that.

3. Finally, the government has to make the massive investment in roadside infrastructure necessary to really bring your idea to fruition. Do you *really* think they are going to do that while a significant portion of the UK's vehicle fleet are people-driven? So let's add another 5 years on for construction and getting the government on board with the plan.

That's 5 + 10 + 10 + 5 = 30 years at the very earliest for a fully-autonomous inter-communicating fleet of cars. If you'd like to dispute any of my numbers with reasoned argument I'd love to be proved wrong - that's why I'm posting in the first place. 

If you'd just like to call me an unreasonable idiot again, may I politely request that you stop responding.

There should be no requirement for an indicator that the car is being automatically driven.

As long as the vehicle and ""driver"" are road-legal, they should be the same as any other vehicle.

As for regulations against hacking or tampering, that's going about it the wrong way.

The right way to do it is to make it illegal to have an uncertified vehicle on the road.  A home user / university / company can do all the tweaking they want to do as long as they don't take that version out on the public roads.  When they're ready to apply to have it certified, they can take it to a government run test facility, and the test should be similar to a driver's license test for a human or a vehicle inspection for a [home made](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/vr/spcnsreg.htm) car.

The illegal act shouldn't be ""hacking"" the car's software, it should be going on the road with that software.

(Level 2): This level involves automation of at least two primary control functions designed to work in unison to relieve the driver of control of those functions. An example of combined functions enabling a Level 2 system is adaptive cruise control in combination with lane centering.Limited Self-Driving Automation

(Level 3): Vehicles at this level of automation enable the driver to cede full control of all safety-critical functions under certain traffic or environmental conditions and in those conditions to rely heavily on the vehicle to monitor for changes in those conditions requiring transition back to driver control. The driver is expected to be available for occasional control, but with sufficiently comfortable transition time.

Also, if his numbers are just for the USA, that is not necessarily a reasonable comparison - he's comparing a future technology (self-driving cars utilizing built up infrastructure) to a current implementation of transit (which very few transit people would say is good to begin with).  What are the efficiency numbers for the French TGV, the Shinkansen, the Mexico City Metro, and the Shanghai Maglev, (all decently well implemented systems) for example?

144,worldsmithroy,"&gt; High speed rail is an old technology that hasn't progressed much if at all in 30 years.

First, there have been innovations more recently than 30 years ago:

* [The current TGV world speed record is 574.8 km/h (357.2 mph), achieved on 3 April 2007 on the new LGV Est.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV_world_speed_record)
* The [Siemens Velaro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_Velaro) family had its first order placed in 1994, one set the unmodified speed record in July of 2006
* The [Shanghai Maglev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Maglev_Train) was constructed in 2001 and entered service in 2004.
* I'm fairly certain wifi didn't start going on rail until after the turn of the century
* Rail already has [a plethora of Grade 4 examples in service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_driverless_trains#Grade_of_Automation_4_Systems)

Second, this argument is analogous to saying:

&gt; Sharks are an old species that haven't progressed much, if at all, in millions of years.

The problem with it is that change is motivated by need, and certain solutions already meet the need they are defined for well (for instance, we still have sharks).  When a solution is a good match for a problem-space, further development is impractical - if the maximum acceleration people can handle standing is .1 g, then there is little point in developing a train that can accelerate at 10 g.  Additionally, there are lots of small internal changes which can happen, but are not very obvious.

&gt; These infrastructure investments take years of planning and years of constructing. Infrastructure for cars already exists. We have already made the investment. Our entire way of life is built around them.

So, are you contending that we don't need to widen roads or perform other roadworks to accommodate the new crop of passengers in the self-driving future?  Because, while I totally dig the idea, I don't believe that it is actually the case, given the fact that [congestion pricing is a thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_pricing) and the United States [keeps building new highways](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/02/03/181506/us-keeps-building-new-highways.html).

As far as improving the capacity of existing streets:

* Half-sized cars could up to double road capacity (assuming 100% adoption)
* Perfect digital reflexes could remove [one-third-to-one-quarter](http://www.racemath.info/motionandenergy/stop_distance.htm) of the vehicle separation, which would add an addition 50%-30% capacity.
* &gt;1 g acceleration [isn't common in budget-rate cars](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+g&amp;a=*C.g-_*Unit.dflt-&amp;a=UnitClash_*g.*StandardAccelerationOfGravity--), so transitions between different speed lanes (say, in a  60/75/90 setup) would still cause shockwaves through traffic lanes (and it takes [greater than 1 g of acceleration to transition 15 mph in .5 seconds](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=15+mph+%2F+0.5+seconds+in+gravity+acceleration))
* Autonomous cars are more likely to maintain safe distances than people (which may actually reduce road capacity if people are driving unsafely close)
* On-ramps, Off-Ramps, Corners, and Curbs cannot be resized without roadworks, meaning that you will still have choke-points whenever cars have to transition, which maintain fixed load
* Surface streets still have to tolerate support for pedestrians, which will impair the ability of self-driving cars to maximize street utilization

So theoretically, you could experience capacity tripling in areas where there is little inter-vehicle interaction and the cruising speed isn't too high, but practically, you are more likely to not reap rewards anywhere near that threshold.

Additionally, infrastructure for rails has existed, and was removed at various points.  It also imparts ancillary benefits which even automated vehicles may take advantage of (grade separation allows for higher speeds and is easier to set up with external recharging).

&gt; Your problem is that you view cars and all their flaws in the current paradigm. Full automation changes the paradigm.

The same could be said of you with respect to rail.  One could easily put forward the idea of a rail network linking a collection of small townships (one every 3 miles), each with a small downtown block (~.25 miles in radius) centered on the high-speed metro station (surrounded by suburbs or less-dense urban environment).  Low-speed rail stops at every station, and places downtowns within 3 minutes of each other like a string of pearls, while a high-speed express skips multiple stops and provides noticeably higher speeds to long-distance travelers.  Such a system would have small-network, self-driving car fleets providing connectivity for each township, but by limiting the size of the downtown (by distributing it along the rail-line), you reduce the amount of congestion imparted by a downtown block, and if the township's radius is 1 mile, all travelers are within a 15 minute walk of their destination, and if you have electric scooter parking cars on the train, then you can even reap the benefits [advocated here](http://www.templetons.com/brad/transit-myth.html) of leaning heavily on electric scooters (or townships can implement CitiScooter, if you'd prefer).

Low-Speed Rail definition

* Dwell Time: 30 seconds
* Cruising speed: 120mph
* Acceleration: 0.1 g (the maximum acceleration humans can handle standing, based on my research)
* 60mph average speed is attained at [2.827 miles](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2860mph+%282+*+54.7+seconds+%2B+30+seconds%29+-+2+%2860mph+%2F+120mph%29+0.91+miles%29+%2F+%281+-+60mph+%2F+120mph%29), rounding up to 3 miles makes the math easier.
* Maximum safe line capacity: 0.91 miles between trains, which rounds up to 1 mile/train and means you can have up to 1 train/minute.

The high-speed express line would have similar dwell-times, but use higher cruising speeds and greater station separation.  For reference, an express with a cruising speed of ~150mph that stopped every other station would provide an average speed of [~90mph](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2890mph+%282+*+68.4+seconds+%2B+30+seconds%29+-+2+%2890mph+%2F+150mph%29+1.43+miles%29+%2F+%281+-+90mph+%2F+150mph%29) (the reality is 150 mph is just barely too slow to attain 90mph @ 6 mile separation, so it would have to travel just a hair faster).

Such a system would work well wherever you have long lines or loops, such as the Texas Triangle, around Lake Ponchetrain, and up California.",1394351331,cfy33aa,t1_cfx8ywj,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2014

Practically, a self driving car could easily be near un-hijack-able. Whether it will be, will depend on a few factors like the desired ease of access for the customer himself.

Basically, without detailed knowledge of the cars hardware, i.e, location of ram, hdds etc, it would be near impossible to hack a car.

153,worldsmithroy,"&gt; With high speed rail you have to travel to the station, arrive in time for a set timetable and then begin the train journey.

With self-driving cars, you have to summon a car and wait for it to arrive from the garage or another fare.  Furthermore, you have to travel to the high-speed motorway at a time when congestion is low for the important choke points of your trip (which tends to follow set timetables as well), or risk doubling or tripling your trip time.

&gt; Upon arrival at your destination you must then make your way to your final destination

Just like you have to dismount from the high-speed motorway and make your way to the congested downtown, or through the winding, speed-regulated streets of suburbia.

&gt; So that travel time of 68 minutes becomes more like 108 minutes for the average person travelling from Nottingham to London

You haven't communicated why we should neglect surface street travel for autonomous cars, and since you still have to travel from destination to freeway, so you still pick up up to 20 minutes on each end, same as transit, and you speed is much more impacted by capacity (because of non-trivial vehicle-to-vehicle interactions) than transit.

&gt; People wouldn't worry about fuel costs when they are only £0.01/2 per mile. 

Does that price factor in the cost of shared fleet garages, maintenance personnel, parts, empty travel time, etc.?  Does it cost that to drive at 90mph?

Furthermore, shared fleets necessarily will have a service area (similar to Car2Go and ZipCar), and travel outside of the service area will probably cost twice (or more) what they do inside, because you have to pay for the car to return to the service area.

Also, until you have road-based recharging units, electrified transit still has the refueling advantage, as it doesn't need to stop and refuel, nor does it need to carry the weight of energy storage (batteries are small or non-existent).

Finally, given that the price of eBooks hasn't dropped, despite their removing printing, shipping, storage, and remaindering costs, is it reasonable to assume that all of the savings of self-driving cars will be passed on to the customer?

&gt; Who would choose HS2 when you can take an autonomous vehicle at any time you want for door to door travel with comparative journey times and costs?

You wouldn't, but as a road approaches capacity, travel speeds decrease due to intervehicle interactions.  When transit approaches capacity, comfort decreases, but speed remains at nominal (because there are no intervehicle interactions of note).  This means that during high traffic periods, some people would favor transit over cars because the travel time is faster or more predictable.

HS2 as a specific instance is meaningless to me as an example though, but it could easily be a poorly implemented solution (and generalizing that a given instance of a solution is bad, therefore all instances of that solution are bad sounds like a logical fallacy).",1394385336,cfya2qz,t1_cfy5woy,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2014

155,sjogerst,"Above all else, self-driving cars need predictability and coordination. Fancy features and cool systems are awesome but our entire road system depends on predictability to remain stable. As silly as the example is, I’m not afraid of 4-way stops because the regulations in place dictate what the behavior is at a stop. I know how people are supposed to behave, even if they sometimes break the rules. Clear regulation needs to be in place that require fundamental fail safes that are universal among all self-driving cars no matter the complexity or manufacturer. But, those regulations need to be flexible to allow for innovations. Regulations should focus on requiring specific ability or capability, not specific methods or hardware.

For example, all self-driving cars should be Fail-Safe in design. 
In the event that a failure is detected, backup systems must be present that enable the system to perform many tasks simultaneously. Im going to call this the Detect&gt;Consult&gt;Decide&gt;React chain.

I’m going to illustrate my points with the example of a blown out tire in the fast lane of large freeway during high traffic times.

First among those systems would be the ability to Detect faults and gather data appropriately. The onboard computer of our car must be able to sense many kinds of data, from blown out tires to internal computer failure and must be hardened or redundant enough to withstand and react to catastrophic situations with near instant reaction times. The computer needs to Detect first. Does it sense a blown out tire? Which tire? What speed is it currently traveling? Which way are the wheels pointing? How will this affect the driving characteristics of the car? What cars are around me? Which of those cars are self-driving? Which cars are NOT self-driving? What are the current road characteristics? Is it asphalt? Concrete? Gravel? What my stopping distances? Is there a shoulder? What lane am I currently in? etc. etc. etc... There are literally hundreds of important variables for the computer to record that might be important depending on the situation. The majority of that data should already be known the computer and should be actively monitored.

The next step in the chain is to Consult. A self-driving car should have the ability to consult the other self-driving cars on the road around it. Our car experiencing a blown out tire would relay its current situation to the cars around it for a distance of (for the sake of discussion) 1 mile. Instantly every self-driving car on the road for a radius of 1 mile knows that our car is in trouble and knows specific details about the cars situation. Collectively, each car then pursues its own Detect&gt;Consult&gt;Decide&gt;React chain with the goals of assisting the distressed car in its eventual goal of getting off the road as soon as possible. The cars behind the distressed car in all lanes preemptively and collectively slow down by a few miles per hour while the cars in front of the distressed car all speed up by a few miles per hour. This nearly instantly creates a large gap in traffic for the distressed car to get off the road. This is a key concept. Each self-driving equipped car when presented with an emergency needs to react in the best possible manner to sustain traffic flow while safely facilitating the actions of distressed cars.

Having consulted with the many self-driving cars around it, our car is now about to decide what action to take to safely protect the occupants of the car. Our car has collected its own data, broadcasted that data to the relevant cars around it, and it has also received important information from those other cars. Having reviewed that enormous amount of information, our self-driving car has decided that it needs to pull over as soon as possible.

It is now time for the car to react to the problem. Because of the communication and data exchange between the self-driving cars,  a large gap in the traffic flow has already manifested and allows our car to go from the fast lane unimpeded to the shoulder where it can safely slow down… But wait! There a classic car enthusiast in the middle of that large traffic gap and he’s blocking your way to the shoulder! His car is not equipped with any this technology! That’s okay. Our car already knows about him because one of the other cars around him noticed he’s not equipped and relayed that information to our car effectively telling us “watch out! That car is an unpredictable variable and may be a problem!”.  Because our car has realized that this Classic in the way of us pulling over, the computer must perform a mini Detect&gt;Consult&gt;Decide&gt;React chain. Collectively the self-driving cars decide that the car behind the Classic should slow down and make more room for our car to slip in behind him and over to the shoulder. Crisis averted with minimal traffic flow disruptions.

To see this actually happen would look, to put it simply, insane. Within the order of a couple of seconds, the situation would be under control and safe. As a bystander, by the time you actually heard the tire blow out and turned your head, the whole thing would be over and all you would see is a car on the shoulder slowly coming to a halt. Cars traveling at 70MPH would all instantly be slowing down and speeding up in unison and there would be no traffic backups like we see today. It would really be an incredible sight. The cool thing is that the concept is infinitely adaptable. Let’s say there’s no shoulder. The car pulls over as far to the right as possible but relays the information down the road for oncoming traffic to merge well ahead of the obstacle. The self-driving cars merge perfectly at highway speed to clear the lane and the impact to traffic is minimal while we change our tire.

The key concept point here is that regulations would be required to standardize certain aspects of the self-driving cars. For instance, the communication protocols between the cars would have to be standardized. We can’t have BMW’s all talking to each other but refuse to communicate with Audi’s. At the same time we need those regulations to be adaptable as technology improves.

You're right though - it comes down to visibility. A major barrier to current autonomous driving systems is having hardware capable of seeing in extreme rain and white-out/snowsquall conditions as well as human eyes can. Part of this is in the software-level interpretation such as pattern recognition algorithms that can make out road lines in low visibility conditions.

Ultimately, the autonomous systems will need to be able to tell how far they can see (what the visibility is) and use visual cues (and to a lesser extent cues from the responsiveness of the steering and acceleration/braking) to tell how slippery the road ahead (and underneath the car) is.

162,worldsmithroy,"&gt; I am not against high speed transit

You sound fairly against high-speed transit in your posts...

&gt; My point of view like others is that you can not build or plan for high speed rail without considering the impact of autonomous vehicles and the rise of electric vehicles. 

What range of impact?  25-year? 50-year? 100-year?  Because depending on range it's impossibly to plan for emerging technologies and their impacts that far out.

Also, I am accounting for self-driving vehicles replacing last-mile transit solutions like buses, freeing up resources to flow into mid-rang,e high-speed metro solutions.  I just don't see self-driving cars replacing all transit solutions below airplane.

&gt; Planning for high speed rail should not begin until we have transitioned into an autonomous vehicle society

I don't understand the rationale behind delaying infrastructure investment until an emerging technology has finished emerging - such logic could be used serially to delay any chain of infrastructure improvements ad infinitum (not limited to transit).

&gt; But at this stage (2030) given high speed rails track record, planning and construction could take another 20 years. 

China seems to be able to lay HSR at a fast clip, so the question is more one of willingness to pay for timely delivery (in money or advocation).

&gt; What about the developments in Maglev?

Maglev is just HSR with different parameters, fixating on the technology in the suspension and motor seems daft (like saying, what about the developments in rubber tire metro, or the reinvented shock absorbing wheel?).

&gt; The reason why we are not seeing any private investment in schemes such as HS2 is because no private organisation would be so barmy as to waste £50bn-£80bn on a project with such high risk, insecurity and unpredictability.

Or because private entities don't, as a rule, invest in infrastructure projects - even Google Fiber consists largely of buying existing fiber networks, and seems motivated more to drive other carriers to invest in their networks.  Unless you have a counter-example?

Infrastructure is an odd market-case, because there tends to be a high initial investment, there is market risk, and lastly, if there is a need, it is not uncommon for municipalities to pay for the investment themselves.

&gt; &gt;without considering the impact of autonomous vehicles and the rise of electric vehicles.

&gt; When it comes to this, there are very few people I personally would listen to because most people have a linear vision.

The bus may move more people per hour through a given intersection in a downtown grid, but that's the ONLY efficient part of a bus commute.

If you're going to talk about efficiency you have to talk about it from the passenger's point of view or it's just a meaningless number. 

By contrast a car leaves when you want, and takes a direct route from door to door. My own anecdotal example is that when I dutifully rode the bus for 9 months to do my bit for air pollution my 15-minute one-way car commute averaged 50 minutes by bus. I finally gave it up as a huge waste of time. Of course, on the bus I could read and do other things that I can't do while driving. Well, Hello self-driving cars.

The 50-minute commute I mentioned included a bus lane for most of the trip between my neighborhood and downtown Seattle. The bulk of the time consisted of taking a roundabout route through my area to pick up people and drop them off, and the walk-and-wait time for my second bus downtown. My commute was exactly 9 miles. Even though most of the mileage was in a bus lane at 45-50mph my average commute speed was less than 11mph. That's just pathetic. 

Anyway, my original post wasn't about buses, it was about choosing federal funding of high-speed rail vs self-driving cars. High-speed rail is really only relevant to speeding up travel between cities, which is a small piece of the whole travel picture.

180,SplitReality,"&gt; Some studies appear to suggest huge increases are in fact possible – for example, one study estimates that capacity would almost quadruple, and another finds quintupled capacity. However, their calculations consider endless streams of densely-packed vehicles. 

This level of potential efficiency is too great to ignore. Self driving cars will become the new HOV. One SDC only lane would equal the capacity of 4 to 5 others. That's going to be the incentive to push this along. Traffic planners would do well to spend their limited budgets in increasing SDC only lanes. Commuters would would be incentivized to buy SDC with the lure of faster travel times without having giving up the convenience of driving in their own car.

Unfortunately as the article states this only works well for highway driving. However automatic speed control systems in cars would help with road capacity in stop and go heavy traffic situations. For example, I wonder what the effect would be if cars were equipped with a simple system that matched the acceleration of the car in front up to 10 mph for use at traffic intersections. That should allow a few more cars to get through the intersection per each cycle. 

These types of automation improve traffic efficiency and should be promoted with the tax code. Getting more of these types of vehicles on the road helps everybody, even those without the automated cars since it reduces the traffic they have to face.

Horseshit. First of all, it's going to be thirty years *after* the introduction of the self driving car before we can expect the proportions of manually driven cars to dip below 5% in the first world. Second, self-driving cars will still have to deal with unpredictable outcomes when real-world chaotic behaviour occurs, such as the effects of inclement weather or mechanical failures.

If the brakes give out on a self-driving car - some brake line fails, say - even the best computer-driven instant-reaction outcome may be the car plunging over the side of a cliff, or careening into oncoming traffic that is simply going too fast to be able to stop in time even given some kind of broadcast warning from the affected car.

To me a system which includes the roads being designed for self driving cars will always sound better than purely a system that just uses a system built in the car to run automatically. It would be much more reliable because each road would be modified for self driving cars in mind, there are a load of confusing abnormal roads and roads where road markings and stuff aren't clear which could interfere with self driving cars that use radar type sensors. 

$5.85 billion is nothing to outfit every road in California with hardware to assist self driving cars, it's such a tiny amount. If the everage state costs $5billion and there are 50 states then thats $250billion. The yearly US budget is well over $3trillion so $250b is about 7.5% of that which is quite a lot. BUT of course you wouldn't do it in 1 year, it would be like a 10 year project which makes it cost 0.75% per year for 10 years which sounds good to me. That amount is feasible for most other developed countries too. For the countries that can't afford to have that then they can just use the system you're talking about since it would obviously still be developed too since it'll only cost a few billion apparently which is actually pennies on a world wide scale.

Having the system where all roads are modified for self driving cars will probably let us reach true autonomous driving much quicker too, since once it's done it's done.

A) you don't know what you are talking about.  big business sets the trend.  how many sports cars get sold yearly.  how many cars to the 'working' class get sold.  my guess is that the nissan altima is a bigger driver in the market than a mazda rx-8.

B) how quickly do you think, 'your' way of thinking is going to last when insurance companies give reduced rates to autocars (and yes they will be safer, they have already been proven to be, over and over again).  OR BETTER YET.  how much will you have to pay insurance for being driven around in a 'timeshare' style auto-car? ($0). 

its not about whether i WANT to own a car or not, its about the economics.  sure there will be dicks, no offense, you honestly sound like one, like you who want to keep their suv/sports car.  and it will represent a percentage of the population, similar to the number of people who own 'vintage' cars today.  but honestly, when the car can drive itself, its incredibly inefficeint to own it, as it will be doing nothing for a majority of its time.  that time would make much more sense having it being 'time shared'.  immagine this.  in the begining people will still be owning their cars.  then people will own auto-cars.  they will realize the opportunity and something like UBER will show up.  ""monetize your car"", ""make money while it sits in the lot.""  ""it'll be back by the time you need it.""  and then taxi companies will be replaced by auto-cars.  people will say, hey i don't need a car everyday to get to work, i can rent it for the few hours i need it (during the commute) and not have to own/wash/maintain it while not using it.  Sure maybe they got on a long weekend and rent the car for the long weekend.  (even then it wouldn't make as much sense as taking an autoride)

so lets pretend you agree that autocars are in our future.  i don't know, since this is self driving cars reddit, to some extent you must agree.

now, what makes more sense, getting a auto-car by yourself.  or having the network of auto-cars create 'carpools'.  you send in a pickup/drop off times, a car shows up and drops you off...but might have other people in the car.  you pay the premium so you get picked up last and dropped off first, AND the shotgun seat, woot.  

now take that scenario and imagine going cross country.  lets say two people in philadelphia are going south.  1 to baltimore, and 1 to DC for this example.  wouldn't it make sense to maybe drop off the baltimore/or DC person and have them catch another vehicle for the final length.  (the answer is yes, OBV).  so imagine long distance car pool where you can, as with the daily commute pay by the number of stops you take.  if you pay ultra premium you get the car you start with all the way to the end.  otherwise, maybe you have 2 stops each with a 5-10 minute layover.  i still think people would take that option.

your opinion of cars is rooted in the early 2000, american i can own as much as i want.  the coming decades and century are going to put that to the test.  both due to popluation increase and population density increase. 

just imagine what your opinion of New York City is?  where the price of rent for a parking space for a month can be more than some people pay, in america, for their rent.  it'll just be easier than owning a car.

Essentially, in no way do I want some communal, shared jellybean-mobile that a bunch of other people have shat up. I accept that many people *will* get those, though, and will prefer them, and that's fine too, but it has to remain an option for people to be free and own their own vehicles that aren't tracked and controlled by external forces.

&gt; now, what makes more sense, getting a auto-car by yourself. or having the network of auto-cars create 'carpools'.

I do more than go to work, though. I go hiking and camping, drive down logging roads (YES, in that RX-8), drive vast distances, drive in the snow, you name it. 

Owning my own vehicle absolutely makes sense to me, I can work on it, I can know its maintenance history and trust what I've seen with my own eyes, rather than hoping some eminently fallible business process has taken care of all that for me.

Why do self-driving cars get so conflated with communal fleet cars for so many people here? There's no reason they need to be part and parcel.

202,PaulGodsmark,"There is going to be several magnitudes more data with self-driving cars (SDCs) than with any previous technology in my opinion. If it is a shared automated fleet SDC then who has rights to that data?

In theory there could be real time data covering everything within sensor range outside the vehicle.  Cameras seeing everything to the front and LiDAR seeing 360 degrees 10 times a second. You can learn a great deal from LiDAR data.

It will be possible to track every other vehicle within range on the road and work out where it might be heading, if it is slowing down for something (maybe checking out the 'Sale' sign outside a shop).  We will instantaneously know what the local traffic volume and patterns are.

Combined with the LiDAR it will be able to track every pedestrian and bicyclist etc.  From the data it will be possible to extrapolate height, weight, sex, age? etc. and see what each person is doing and if there is a pattern to behaviour that has any commercial value so someone.

It will be possible to monitor any new static items that have appeared in the street - maybe a cafe has placed tables and chairs out for the first time that year as the weather has improved etc. etc. 

I have no idea of the commercial value of this real time data tracking everything that is happening on or near the streets - but that there is value in it I think is beyond doubt.

Also, anyone that commits a crime within sight of a street.... the chances of being caught on some form of SDC sensor will just get higher and higher once they start to be deployed.

One of the main drivers in this is Moore's Law which states that computing power will double every two years.  This continuous improvement in this core technology has allowed for technological improvements that weren't possible previously.

With a technology that is going to impact on almost every aspect of daily life and see money flows around 8% of GDP or greater then the whole environmental impact question is going to be hugely complex.  Staggeringly complex.

So many mega-principles and mega-trends are converging with self-driving car technology, and it is fundamentally going to change how and where we live and work.  Just like the invention of the original motor car changed society irrevocably.  We will see similar changes with this paradigm shift.

I can foresee scenarios where environmental impact is much better, and much worse.  Also Jevon's Paradox comes into play - if we have something that is more efficient then we end up using it more so that the overall detrimental impact is similar to what it always was.

It is almost inevitable that we will see more electric vehicles - but for many jurisdictions like my own, that simply means we move from internal combustion engine emissions in towns and cities to increased emissions from coal and oil power stations - is that a good compromise?

It's good that people are asking the questions about self-driving cars and the environment, but the discussions needs to advance an awful long way from the simple overview of pieces like the lead article here.

Cars are essentially huge masses of metal and glass hurtling at incredible speeds through populated areas. While I love humans dearly, it is no longer the reasonable choice for them to oversee such systems. We've proven that. Humans behind the wheel cause more pollution, accidental (and intentional) deaths and injuries, damage, and road hazards (like traffic jams) than autonomous systems. We are far from being the better choice and the logic is blatant: when you encounter a hazard, it's just you thinking for a split second about what would be best to do but when an autonomous car encounters a hazard, it has the years of experience of teams of engineers to decide what the best course of action would be (and execute it flawlessly). Humans behind the wheel are dangerous to everyone and we can't progress a system like the road system until we acknowledge that we should not, in fact, be in control. 

So should humans be allowed to drink and ride in autonomous vehicles? Yes; if we don't give them a way to mess the system up (manual mode).

The good news is that not a single paper published thus far is suggesting that we will need more passenger vehicles to meet our needs - and it would seem that this paper is on the lower end of predictions - which is absolutely fine with me as that makes it more credible when viewed from the current paradigm.

255,e4e6,"That's a great point. I think the simple answer is that while landing an airplane is one of the most dangerous parts of its operation, pulling a vehicle to the side of the road is one of the safest. I know the Google car has a mechanism where if the driver does not take over when requested, say due to a heart attack, the car will simply pull over and put on its flashers.

But it is a great question as to whether pulling over is the safest thing. Bryant Walker Smith [posed a variation of this problem,](https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2012/07/self-driving-crash-test) although from a legal perspective:

&gt; The year is 2020. Several automakers now sell vehicles equipped with highly advanced driver assistance systems. Under optimal conditions, these systems generally guide the vehicle both longitudinally (forward) and laterally (sideways) over long distances. Although every owner’s manual states that the driver must remain alert at all times, the media quickly dub these vehicles “the first publicly available self-driving cars.” One automaker, Genius Car Co., shows ads in which a grateful customer recounts how, when she had a heart attack behind the wheel, her Genius NeverCrash automatically pulled to the side of the road, safely stopped, and called an ambulance.

&gt;Paul is one of 100,000 eager buyers of the NeverCrash. He feels so confident in his car’s driver assistance features that he doesn’t think twice about driving while drowsy. Late one night, while crossing a long and foggy causeway, he engages his NeverCrash’s automated system, relaxes as that system expertly takes over, and quickly though unintentionally falls asleep. The system tries to alert Paul with various vibrations and sounds, but Paul merely begins dreaming of Los Angeles.

&gt;Because Paul does not react, the NeverCrash automatically activates its hazard lights, pulls to the side of the causeway, and stops next to a “No Stopping” sign. Omniscience Inc., the data provider for Paul’s subscription navigation service, has coded this five-foot shoulder as an “emergency safe stop area.” However, at least one competitor’s vehicle—which uses a different dataset—would have attempted to drive to the end of the causeway before stopping.

&gt;While stopped, Paul’s NeverCrash is struck by a car driven by Julie. The NeverCrash anticipates the crash but does nothing to prepare. The latest version of the NeverCrash software would have adjusted Paul’s seat and seatbelt; Genius could have remotely added this functionality to Paul’s vehicle, but it has not done so. The crash injures both Paul and Julie (who each have car insurance). It also generates a heated argument between them, the audio and video of which is automatically recorded by Paul's NeverCrash and transmitted to Omniscience.",1395782179,cgbsjy7,t3_218bu6,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2014

* cars that don't have collisions can be built very light weight, using inexpensive materials
* cars that are light weight need very small, simple motors and other drivetrain components (more similar to a golf cart than a Honda Civic)
* the same technology that is bringing us self-driving cars is bringing us completely automated, vertically integrated manufacturing

Anyway, level 4 is an inevitability, we just are going to wait for it.  Level 3 cars are going to be increasingly in the hands of consumers in the next 4-7 years, and after that point there will be a lot more pressure on extending the driveable conditions for level 3 and approaching level 4.

I would say cities with self-driving initiatives/auto-maker partnerships are more likely in the near-term than long-distance routes.  Once a city has a large enough population of drivers with level 3 vehicles, there starts to be an enormous incentive for that city to start integrating systems that make it easier for manufacturers, and to enter into agreements with these manufacturers to test broader and broader systems.

Though it is probably possible for cars to get by just fine without, in practice level 4 is going to require replacing traffic cops, placing transponders everywhere road work takes place, and equipping emergency vehicle with notification systems.  All of these things tend to be coordinated on a local level, and you're going to see municipalities picking these up at variable rates.

&gt; Presumably the liabilities of the manufacturers of driverless cars will not be much different than the liabilities of the manufacturers of traditional cars that had a mechanical failure that resulted in injury.

Accidents due to mechanical failures are extremely rare, expensive, complicated cases.  But with driverless cars, there would be no accidents if the manufacturer's systems were working 100%.

In fact, if the vehicle has proper safety and internal vehicle-health monitors in place, the manufacturer can ensure that even routine maintenance issues never rise to the level of an accident.  Today, you might cause an accident by failure to maintain the braking system.  But tomorrow, with a self-driving car, the manufacturer becomes responsible for restricting the control system from operating in a dangerous condition.

In other words, the car should say, ""No, I'm not moving from this spot because the brakes are screwed up and I might kill someone.""  It should also be able to say, ""No, I'm not moving right now, because the roads are too icy for my traction control systems.""

As it happens, there is a great deal of exciting action in the open source multi-core DSP space. Most notably is the Adapteva Parallela multi-core math co-processor that was funded through a Kickstarter a few years back. I was a supporter and the project faced serious delays due to supply chain hassles but the boards are now shipping and self-driving cars needing to do lots of floating point math for lidar is a great target for those devices. 

Adapteva is a really small team of engineers that originally was seeking venture capital funding but wasn't getting enough so they turned to crowd sourced funding and part of their appeal to their backers was the promise to keep everything as open as was possible and to facilitate a community for multi-core floating point processor programming similar to what exists for Arduino and Raspberry Pi. 

So this problem might not be as daunting as it seems. It's a major mistake to underestimate the engineering talent available in open source. In most cases the technical level of open source goes far beyond what commercial software offers precisely because openness creates numerous real technical advantages.

I'm going to cross post our [discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/energy/comments/223opx/koch_brothers_quietly_seek_to_ban_new_mass/cgjegjw) from r/energy because this is a more appropriate place for it, and I think this topic is pretty cool to discuss.

Ok, firstly, you're extremely quick to try to bury me in information.  I get the impression that you want to win an argument more than you want to have a discussion.

But I'll give you the benefit of the doubt here.

&gt;Google says 2017, all car manufacturers that are researching say 2020.

Maybe.  But that may just be advertising, and legislation needs to catch up.  I doubt it will ever be legal to unleash a self-driving car that the NHSTA hasn't tested extensively.  I believe the regulations will slow it down, not the technology itself.

&gt;That's not that long from now. How long ago did the first iphone come out? Where are we now with that tech? What were phones like before the iphone? Tech improves at an exponential rate, us humans have a hard time grasping this concept in how it affects us.

Sorry, but not at all relevant.

&gt;High speed rail in California won't be expected till 2033!!!

True, but again that's project difficulties.  The technology already exists and is proven.  Self-driving cars do not have that luxury, so my bet is still on rail.

&gt;Trains get better fuel economy to a degree. SF to LA I would imagine Self Driving Big Rigs would be fuel efficient and faster then a train.

Here's the biggest problem.  Big rigs get 5-7 MPG, whereas trains get several hundred.  [source 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_efficiency_in_transportation), [source 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_efficiency#Fuel_efficiency_in_transportation).

Big rigs would benefit from automation, no doubt.  But there are other issues; their horrible aerodynamics, the trucker unions that would fight this tooth and nail, and their inefficient ICE-only powertrain (making them hybrid would help).  

But that's a lot to overcome, and achieving similar MPG as trains is practically impossible.  For one thing, trains use diesel-powered electric motors, like the Volt, which trucks can use too, but trains don't have to stop as often.

Plus, they carry different amounts of cargo and serve vastly different purposes.  Trains and trucks go where the other can't.  One will never be able to fully replace the other.

That's not to say self-driving isn't going to revolutionize transportation.  It certainly will, and I look forward to it, if only to make my commute more bearable.  But saying that all other transportation is meaningless because an unproven technology is on the horizon (which is what you're claiming) is not a claim that you can support.

Please be aware that on this sub-reddit we are trying to get to the bottom of this - with folks like Morgan Stanley predicting that when full deployed self-driving vehicles will save the US somewhere around $1.3 trillion or more, then you can understand that NHTSA may also be under pressure to not delay.  Also NHTSA wouldn't want to unnecessarily delay with some 34,000 folks being killed every year on US roads - that's around 90 people/day.  So yes NHTSA have to have certified the tech safe, but they also cannot reasonably insist on 100% safety either - as too many people would be dying every day that extra testing is required.

&gt;High speed rail in California won't be expected till 2033!!!

&gt;True, but again that's project difficulties. The technology already exists and is proven. Self-driving cars do not have that luxury, so my bet is still on rail.

I can see why you think that - but self-driving cars are essentially in beta testing mode at the moment.  Be it 2017, or 2020, they will arrive at some point, and it will be before 2033.  What we need is some due diligence to work out if California High Speed Rail is justified - given all the impacts that new infrastructure brings, and the fact that self-driving road trains could be in use for many years on that corridor before the HSR is built.  There's no 'slam-dunk' argument here - but definitely a need for due diligence before committing tens of billions of dollars on proven tech, when the rapidly emerging tech offers some very interesting benefits.

Be aware that self-driving vehicle trains will be able to platoon - thus saving energy.  They can be driven all night at a constant speed - say 50mph that saves more energy. They remove the need for double-handling of the cargo in many cases as they are door-to-door.

There will very likely always be a case for heavy rail, but the current balance swings a little more towards road freight with the advent of self-driving vehicles.  How much? - I don't know; but the balance definitely changes.

As you say - one will (probably) never replace the other - but it does in my opinion require much greater due diligence against all new proposed heavy rail infrastructure development.

By stating that vehicle and automated system developments are related, they imply that the 'evolutionary' approach from ADAS to self-driving is correct. Whereas I see the jump from ADAS to self-driving being more 'revolutionary' - and at least VW have admitted this in a presentation at the TRB workshop in 2013.

For me the leap from ADAS to self-driving is all about the software, the artificial intelligence connected with basically off-the-shelf sensors that any automaker has access to (including all that are not on this list). Automakers are by nature hardware people introducing software at a rapidly increasing rate.  Google are a software company applying it to hardware, and that immediately puts them at an advantage in my opinion. If you look at how many artificial intelligence research papers that Google have produced then you get a picture of company that really is making progress with AI.

So in this ranking, in terms of the software development then Google are clearly in the lead and when certified safe their system can easily be fitted to any vehicle that can accommodate the necessary sensors - and most of the more pimped out vehicle models have a growing number of these sensors already.

On my report card Google are the only one with an 'A', but need to demonstrate that they have someone to build the self-driving cars in the near future if they are to retain their high rating.  Given that they were already talking to all vehicle manufacturers that were interested back in April 2012 then it is quite possible one or more automakers are still in discussion.  Given that some scenarios show that any automaker licensing the Google tech has a much greater chance of surviving than those that don't, then don't be surprised if there is much more going on behind the scenes between Google and the automakers than we are aware of.

Parents no longer have to drive a minivan to work.  They can use a little high-mpg car, or even an electric car, for their commutes.  For family events, you can use a big SUV or minivan.  For long trips, something large and comfortable, but with decent fuel economy.  And for date night, something small and sporty.


This also combines nicely with the adoption of self-driving cars.  Maybe you love to drive, but not many people love their commute.  So rent a self-driving model for day-to-day work and a manual model to drive out to the lake for the weekend.


I'm a boring, middle-aged person with a kid who users the rental model, and it means that rather than buying a car that can seat 7 (for carpooling), has room for three bikes, accommodates carseats, etc. I can drive whatever kind of car I need at the moment.

Some customers will choose not to use the service due to rational fear of theft. Some suited products will be printed at home or near by commercial 3D printing centers. Many customers will be put off by the price tag. No fly zones will be established by various disgruntled organisations and stakeholders. 

As for the Pizza delivery. I didn't say it would be 3D printed...but it could be. How many people would be willing to pay 50% upwards the cost of the pizza just to have it delivered by a drone? What takeaway's would see business sense to use this system? If you have 10 orders in 30 minutes you end up sending out 10 drones. How many drones do you think these organisations will be willing to invest in/[put up with. Yes you could send out two maybe three orders with one drone, but will the drone have enough range to deliver to all three and return? Can you guarantee that each customer takes their order and not more. 

This is self driving cars. We quite often discuss and post about the efficiency of shared fleets. All of course having to deal with peak demand. When it comes to delivery via drones the assumption is this will be a premium quick service. In order to not be overwhelmed prices would have to be high enough to discourage many potential costumers from using the service. Otherwise you end up with countless drones that are not in use during off peak hours or you end up with minimal drones with a shitty delivery service turn around time.

365,nosoupforyou,"&gt;We go over all of your inaccuracies quite often.

Oh, I didn't realize I was the inaccurate one. I could swear it was you.

&gt;Electric cars are cheaper to operate now. 

Operate, yes.  Purchase, no.

&gt;Tesla announced plans for an affordable electric car rumored to be around $35,000. 

And lots and lots of decent cars are 16-22k, considerably less than $35k, which is still less than most electric cars.  Tesla may have announced it for $35k but there is a long waiting list.

&gt;But within urban and suburban areas autonomous vehicles typically won't need much range. 

Uh, wrong.  Within URBAN areas perhaps, but suburban it's not uncommon to need to drive 60+ miles.  It would kind of suck to have to pull over for several hours to recharge.  Also, occassionally people like to go visit family or friends that live even farther away.

But no, according to you no one could possibly ever need to drive very far.  And you are completely ignoring people who live outside of urban and suburban areas.

&gt;You offering no data is Bullshit.

Nope. It's simple logic.  Frankly YOUR data is bullshit because there IS no data yet for self driving cars.

&gt;Your point about ''The fact is that if you use your car a lot, renting is going to cost more than owning, partly because of the profit required for the actual service and partly because of the extra driving that the taxi will requirem getting to you and returning'' is too vague. 

Not at all.  You could easily own a car for 8 years, keeping it in good condition, years after paying it off.  This means the cost per mile is very low.  A taxi on the other hand will need to be replaced after 3-4 years, meaning it's going to be having to cover loan payments all the time.  

Even assuming the cost per mile was the same, the owner of the taxi has to make a profit, not to mention cover other fees that private owners don't.  Therefore the cost per mile for renting a taxi will ALWAYS be higher than the cost per mile for owning, assuming both vehicles are used the same amount.  The only other factor here is how much it's used.  If the private vehicle is used very little, then it becomes more economical to rent the taxi.

This is just like owning vs renting a carpet cleaner.  If you clean your carpets once a week, it's worth just buying a carpet cleaner rather than renting one from the hardware store.  You save money by owning.  But if you only use it once ever 4 years, then renting the carpet cleaner saves you money.

&gt;At some point yes it would be cheaper to own, but not for the average commuter doing 15,000 miles per year.

Actually it probably will be cheaper to own if you're doing 15k a year.

&gt; Any profit margin associated with shared fleets may well be absorbed entirely by subsidies. 

Your wishful thinking about subsidies.  Just because you wish for them doesn't mean they will come.  You haven't provided ANY reason for them.

&gt;It isn't realistic thinking it is logical. 

Correct.  It's not realistic thinking that the government will subsidize taxi services.

&gt;Shared fleets/mobility on demand will offer the same benefits and then some. They will operate just like mass transit. 

Unlikely.  When the government thinks of public transit, they think of mass amounts of people at once.  When they think of improving public transit, they think of adding more trains, adding more train lines, making the trains prettier, or spending $20 million on a study to see if we can have a magnetic superspeed train.  Aside from that, there will be no reason to subsidize robotaxi fleets.

&gt;The reason personally owned vehicles depreciate differently is due to the nature of the paradigm. A shared fleet would purchase a new vehicle and within 2 years the vehicle will reach it's lifetime miles.

Your logic suggests that taxis will simply depreciate faster than private vehicles.  

&gt;The personal owner will have a limited amount of people to sell to. The bottom will drop out of the market. 

Wishful thinking again.  The fact is that lots of people won't buy cars that were rentals or taxis.  If they are too beat up to continue running as taxis, why would people buy them as private vehicles.  They would need major fixing before they could be resold, in which case the prices would be high, meaning that private vehicle sales won't be nearly as impacted as you think.

&gt;Which leaves no-one for person A or B to sell to. 

If that were true, then no one would ever CURRENTLY be able to sell their privately owned car.  You do realize that plenty of taxis and rental cars are sold every day, right?

Also, lots of cars aren't suitable as taxis.  Fleet cars are generally sedans.  There's a WHOLE MARKET for trucks, coupes, even sedans that have options that taxis wouldn't have.

But no, you're of the opinion that everyone will only want used taxis.

&gt; Do they sell their vehicle for next to nothing and get a new one or do they continue with their initial investment and stick with the car.

Again you're missing a whole slew of options.  Options such as selling the car and buying another used one that's newer than the old one.  Giving the current car to (the kids, the grandkids, a family friend in need, or even charity, etc)  One could buy a used one that's just a few years old, or a brand new one from the dealer, or settle on renting even though it costs more for some people on a monthly basis.

428,SplitReality,"I think the security issues will get worked out. First off every SDC is a monitoring device. Anybody sending out phony signals would immediately be identified and charged with a pretty serious crime.

Second, I'm confident that security would be taken very seriously. I would assume that each SDC would have a hardware coded security module that contained the car's id and would only allow installation of software signed by the appropriate authority. Any car using an invalid or duplicated id would be instantly identified and charged. In addition, the automated driving software should be a separate system that could only be updated with a physical connection from a device that itself had to be digitally signed from an appropriate  authority. In short there should only be one way to update the software and that way is tightly controlled.

I could keep going with the safety precautions, but you could make it very difficult to tamper with the SDCs software. I am not saying that it couldn't be done, but the effort involved would be well beyond a prankster or ordinary terrorist. Even if someone could sneak a modified car into the system, what is the worst that they could do? Cause a single accident and kill a few people? About 115 fatal car accidents happen in the US everyday today.

The point is that if someone is going to go through all that effort, they'd attack the electrical grid instead and have a far greater impact.

As for someone trying to use a non-SDC in a SDC only area, that should stick out like a sore thumb just as much as trying to use an impostor SDC. That would be an immediate safety hazard which should set off automated warnings and surveillance.  There would be no need for a high speed chase.

That is why I predicted that there are a lot of marginal trips not done now, but will be taken with self-driving cars because they are so much easier.  Self-driving cars will also be used for trips that would never be conceived of today.  

The reason for stating this is, the amount of self-driving cars demanded will be larger than people expect.  Sharing services will most likely replace individual ownership.  I believe I saw stats that 1 shared car can replace 6-7 individual cares due to increased efficiency of use.  However, the number of individual car trips now I think will double, triple or even more so as delivery becomes the standard not a luxury.  People willing to do longer commutes and few even living in cars.  Not to mention people willing to use cars for short city trips that would have been impractical due to parking and traffic.

444,madcuzimflagrant,"&gt;Right, because that worked out great for Toyota when they were ordered to pay out $1.2 billion in the unintended acceleration cases. This was in spite of an extensive study by NASA and NHTSA which found no evidence of faulty software in the vehicles. This work was negated by a jury in Oklahoma when Toyota couldn’t conclusively prove that the accelerations didn’t happen. Good luck trying to prove a negative with the vastly more complicated self-driving systems. 


This is actually very easy to solve.  The vast majority of new vehicles now include a ""black box"" in case of an accident, and it will probably be  mandatory relatively soon.  Combine that with the massive amount of data collected by an SDC and you will have a near-perfect picture of exactly what happened.  It could potentially eliminate the very situations you are protesting.  The Oklahoma jury messed up, but they did so because they were persuaded emotionally and no one was there to witness that Toyota was really in the clear.  These black boxes help protect the manufacturers from false claims (which is why they are being put in voluntarily) and they will eventually lead to a reduction of almost all false claims even between multiple individuals or just between an individual and their insurance company.  The reduction in false claims should have an added benefit of reducing insurance costs as investigations will be easier and less money will be wasted litigating.",1398890619,ch6a64e,t3_24ddtf,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2014

To take a crack at kind of answering your question - we advocate for publicly-subsidized public transportation.  In fact, you could even say that we're somewhat anti-car.  We realize, though, that it's impossible to just get rid of cars given the way the US is built up.  So maybe we're just anti-car where cars don't make sense, like in dense, urban settings.

448,Tiak,"So there's no conceivable reason someone would want to get somewhere in half the time, with 5x the available space, in a scenario with 1/10 the individualized fuel costs?...


High speed rail makes *more* sense in combination with self-driving cars, in my opinion, as it solves the last-mile problem.  

Efficient transport tends to converge on a single solution: A few high-throughput channels, with a very large number of lower-throughput channels branching off periodically, with lower-throughput channels then branching off of these, if necessary.  This is how the circulatory system works, this is how the internet works, and this is how the road system works.  You have arteries/freeways/internet backbone, and capillaries/residential roads/cable serving their respective purposes to get blood/you/data anywhere you might want to go...  But, with public transport, there are notable gaps in this.  You might take a train, then a bus, then another bus, and then might still be several miles away from your destination with no convenient public way to fill this gap.  SDCs solve this.  Going extremely quickly to get to a general area makes sense when, from that train stop you can easily get anywhere within a 20-mile radius, rather than only getting to a few high-density places, dependent upon bus schedules.

You are never going to have room to walk around, stretch your legs, and socialize in self-driving cars.  SDCs are going to be limited by fuel-efficiency of engines, realistic rates of drag, and catastrophic failure scenarios to speeds below 100 mph.  High speed rail still has a strong niche with SDCs in play.",1398898324,ch6dug9,t3_24bwo9,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2014

Thus when the statistics on cars with the self driving ""assist"" ability came in, it would show that these cars are amazingly safe. The insurance companies would be forced (through competition) to drastically lower the prices for those cars. 

Then there would be other countries where self driving cars would be fully legal and if proven safe there then there would a huge uproar to get them here.

But the real solution is that the car companies are looking forward to a few waves of self driving car sales. Basically they know that this could be 5-10 years of the best car sales they have ever seen. Thus the corporate lobbying of the insurance industry will be cancelled by the corporate lobbying of the car industry.

The insurance industry has, for our entire lives managed to charge a massive rent on our ability to drive a car. I will be 100% happy to see that entire industry fall apart. 

Now if we could find a way to end-run the telcos much would be right with this world.

If the public have access to a technology that is certified to be safer, is known to be more fuel efficient and sustainable (it is already proven to drive better, use less fuel and require less maintenance) and can save us money, then the public will use it. If legislation, regulations and liability concerns aren't resolved by then, then it won't stop some of the public wanting to do the sensible thing. Bureaucracy will look foolish if it is preventing safer, more sustainable and efficient technology - although some would argue that this is possibly how bureaucracy normally operates.

Another issue is visibility.  Self-driving cars still need to deal with the human drivers on the road, and we have proven ourselves unable to reliable notice smaller vehicles (such as motorcycles).

Unfortunately, converting one of these in a self-driving car is proportionally more expensive than a family saloon (and here I disagree with u/RockSlice). 

I remember chatting with an engineer from a European manufacturer about three years ago during a big Intelligent Transport Systems event, and the subject of in-vehicle information systems came up. He explained that they were dead against the European Union trying to make things like traffic &amp; incident info or e-Call mandatory, because it would dangerously inflate the cost of their best-selling small cars. For instance, it's only a trivial matter to add an e-Call system to a well-equipped car that already has bluetooth audio, a touch screen, satellite navigation and communication capabilities. However, fitting it to a small, cheap car that doesn't have any of this gadgetry would be a lot more expensive - around 5% in retail price, and that's only for e-Call!

In any case, I do not think we'll see a lot of one-seaters, if only because of the design cost: designing, building and producing a new car costs around 2€bn today, and the cost of the self-driving capability comes on top of that.

&gt; We all know, generally speaking, that the law struggles to keep up with technology. The last two decades … perhaps longer … we have seen leaps in technological development which are so ground breaking that the law struggles to adapt.

Because lawyers are greedy cunts, they have zero interest or reason to help make the law robust, they literally get paid to do the opposite. The self driving car is fine, the way we make the law is broken. This will happen to all disruptive technology when developed in a corrupt environment.

So Google had better hope that its cars are really that good.”

489,another_old_fart,"According to the article the issue seems to be that because of Google's claims, human drivers who get into accidents with autonomous vehicles might try to blame the autonomous car for failing to use its superhuman powers to avoid the accident. 

Google optimism notwithstanding, I think the fact that a car is being driven autonomously should be irrelevant. If I'm an excellent driver who has never been in a wreck or even gotten a ticket, and I get in an accident with somebody with poor eyesight and slow reflexes, who has had ten collisions in the past, I'm not held more responsible just because of having higher ability. Let's continue to resolve which ""driver"" is responsible the way we already do now. 

Say vehicle A and vehicle B collide. Using existing standards we determine that the driver of vehicle A is at fault. Okay, now we're done with the A vs B part, and if driver A is human, we are completely done. 

But if the driver of vehicle A is the vehicle itself, then liability depends on who we hold responsible for the functioning of the car. One possibility is to follow the standards we currently apply to elevator mishaps. An elevator is a self-driving vehicle. All mishaps are the responsibility of someone other than the rider - it might be the building owner, the elevator manufacturer, the maintenance company - I have no idea. It probably varies depending on the contracts between the various parties, and those parties probably point the finger at each other, but there must be precedents, because elevators do malfunction from time to time. 

My point is that this doesn't have to be the murky legal swamp it's made out to be in articles like this. We can use what we already know. Treating autonomous cars like a completely novel and complex legal problem would surely benefit lawyers, but how about we don't? There's no need to go ""whoo boy"" about it.

9,SplitReality,"A self driving car is not the same as a taxi. The main cost of the taxi is paying for the income of the driver. Without a driver a self driving car will have a much lower operating cost than a taxi. Taxis must also use bigger more expensive cars because they must transport the driver along with the passenger. A 2-seater self driving car could handle most trips while no taxi could get away with that.

Car sharing is far more efficient than individually owning a car provided your travel distance is below some threshold for a given time period. Basically if you drive a lot then it becomes cheaper to own, just like it becomes cheaper to own rather than rent for any item that you use a lot. 

Car sharing allows you to match the vehicle to your needs per each trip. For example you can ride in a much smaller and cheaper commuter car when going to work by yourself instead of having to use a larger more expensive less fuel efficient SUV that you'd need to own in order to handle the rarer family trips with the kids. 

In addition to matching the needs for each trip, car sharing allow a family to match their car use needs of the entire family better. There is no need to get an extra car that is rarely used just to handle the few cases where more people need to use a car at the same time. There will be virtually no reason to get teenagers their own car.

Another reason why car sharing is cheaper is because you spread out fixed costs like taxes and time dependent depreciation among more people. Car sharing also allows you to avoid parking fees or at least the cost of gas need for your self driving car to drive it somewhere where it can park for free. Maintenance costs will be higher for owning your car because you won't be able to take advantage of the economies of scale that a sharing service would have. They'll employ mechanics and buy parts in bulk to be able to fix their cars far cheaper than you could.

Personalizing your car and keeping stuff in it are luxury and convenience capabilities. There will definitely be people who will want to do it, but they will be paying extra for the capability. Most people would rather save the money they'd spend just to have a car sit parked most of the time, and use that money for something else.

A bit lower, not much lower. My city has a car sharing scheme, where you can book a car via an app and there are dedicated spots all around the city where you can pick it up or drop it off.

They're cheaper than taxis by some 50%, but still twice as expensive as using your own car. 

Car matching is silly. We would all be driving Toyota Camry's if efficiency was a top priority. It isn't, though. 

&gt;There will be virtually no reason to get teenagers their own car.

There isn't now, in cities with good public transportation. Yet they still want their own cars. Again, a car is often not just a tool to go from A to B. A car is something that's always waiting for you. You don't have to call for it and then wait 20 minutes because there was an accident somewhere between you and that free parking lot. 

&gt;Car sharing also allows you to avoid parking fees or at least the cost of gas need for your self driving car to drive it somewhere where it can park for free.

False. Someone still has to pay those fees and for fuel. It definitely won't be the owner of the fleet.

36,EmperorOfCanada,"The key to all transportation is financial, both micro and macro. Most people don't ""want"" a car, what they want is to be able to go places reliably and cheaply. The reliable part is one of the key failures with most problematic public transit systems. For instance if you have to be at work at a very specific time with regular failure resulting in job loss then the public transit system in my city will let you down. So even if you don't want a car it may very well be best to get one in order to keep your job. Thus the simplistic finances of transit being cheaper then fail. 

On top of this time is money so the often slightly slower speed of public transit must be factored in. (or in some cases the increased speed of public transit)

But in some cities the transit works well enough and the roads poorly enough that cars are actually the more expensive option from the point of view of risk and possibly are simplistically more expensive as well. New York City would be a perfect example of this. 


But SDCs will mix things up. If all cars are SD and thus can be cheap small cars with little crash protection then the financial pressure toward public transit will presumably drop as will the costs of driving in even more crowded cities. But for commuters other interesting options show up such as computer designed car pooling in a van like vehicle. 

But in more crowded scenarios where huge numbers of people are still making the same journey then transit will still be the best option. 

So my prediction is that very compact large cities such as London, New York, Tokyo that self driving public transit will thrive. But in smaller cities that are a bit spread out the self driving car mix will thrive. I suspect that for urbanites car ownership will drop but taxi usage of individual vehicles will increase.

And in LA it will probably remain some form of driving madness.

Then to complicate it a a whole new level is that a number of people use public transit because they can't drive due to legal, age related, or medical reasons. These people may very well find a car advantageous and a SDC could remove them from the public transit system.

41,TheAngryPlatypus,"&gt; Of course it would. All of the studies say we would only need about 1/10th of the cars on the road to meet the demand of daily travel. So basically 90% reduction in car production. 

This is false. Yes, assuming everybody switches to fleet service (unlikely) it could mean a 90% reduction in the number of cars on the road at any given time, but those cars also get used up 10x as fast. A cars life expectancy is almost completely measured in miles driven, not years since it was manufactured. There are three significant things that can reduce the number of cars needed to be manufactured: 

1. Increase the average number of miles a vehicle lasts.
2. Reduce the number of miles people travel.
3. Increase carpooling/ridesharing.

Self driving cars might lead to increases into #1, as fleet providers might well be more motivated to buy long lasting vehicles, constant running is better for long life with internal combustion engines (not a factor for electric vehicles though AFAIK), and the vehicles are more likely to be well maintained. It could also lead to improvements in #3. If anything I would expect it to lead to people traveling more miles by car though. 

This belief that sharing cars somehow makes them magically last more miles needs to **die**.

When SDCs exist and there are fleets of them, taking away someone's license means they have to switch from driving their own car to ether updating or replacing their car with a self driving model, or switching over to using fleet vehicles. Getting your license pulled for doing stupid things would be far more common and requirements for a license more strict.

So biker gets on the road drunk, firstly there's a flag on his license that says ""this person has been drinking"". This may sound odd, but i know that some gas stations scan IDs to ensure they are real so why couldn't a bar? Then as he gets out onto the street you have tons of SDCs tracking him, he's driving erratically and has been flagged as a hazard, Police are called and distances are kept. Lets assume that this bike is a new 2020 model, the bike's internal computer realizes that it itself has been marked as a road hazard. It can't just stop, but it can do everything it can to keep itself and it's rider safe until police arrive. Cap the maximum speed to 20MPH, enable the gyroscopic stabilizer (yes that's a real thing, and [it's a mandatory safety feature in new bikes](http://motorcycles.about.com/b/2012/04/01/gyroscopic-stabilizers-to-be-mandatory-on-all-production-motorcycles.htm), Flash my hazard lights and prepare to slow down to the absolute minimum safe speed when the police arrive. Older bikes may not have these features, but SDCs can avoid the bike by re routing around them through side-streets or simply slowing down and putting priority tracking on them.

Old man could have similar, his license revoked and given X number of free round trips as part of his medicare/disability benefits. His car's registration will still be valid, but flagged. He gets into it and drives off, a SDC scans the license plate (i would assume that this would be a way for SDCs to decipher whether the car is a SDC, a newer non-SDC that has SDC features and a non-SDC when NFC can't) the code hits the police database and is flagged. Cameras on the other cars, infrastructure and and anything else linked to the system would try to determine if the car is being driven by ""old man"" and if it is, Police are dispatched and things like tire spikes could be activated if he is in an urbanized area where stopping him right then would be priority.

These three companies employed  probably between 50% to 60% of the town.

You quickly learn that people who work at these companies also tended to live in the same subdivisions.  The biggest con when it comes to car-pooling is trying to fit everyone's schedule.  Public transportation [does not come to most of these subdivisions](http://www.connect-transit.com/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=22782) (*warning: pdf*).  In fact, majority of the city isn't even on that map.  Compare that map to Google Maps and you'll quickly realize that the buses only touch about a quarter or less of the city. With a self-driving car, you could pretty easily set it up either stop at everyone's house in the morning, or set your own ""bus-stop""  since nobody lives more than a few blocks from anyone else.

Self-driving cars could work as a more specialized form of public transportation crossed with Uber.

The absolue worst-case is some crazy world where they become cheaper because they can be simpler, so everyone buys one, but since they are harder or expensive to park people just keep them driving all the time (empty). Then we have worse congestion (slower drive times) and worse consumption, with marginally more convenience. Don't get me wrong, I think this is unlikely and a lot of things would have to go wrong to get to this point, but this is something to try to avoid.

But if they can just grab an easy shared vehicle from a pool of available vehicles, and this is the primary mode of transportation for both of us, then we are just going to go at separate times when it is most convenient for each of us.  This is a fairly specific case, but it is the general rule behind most rides I see shared between family and friends.  Consolidation usually comes from limited access, and from selecting between the most convenient of multiple modes of transport.  If two people both drive or both take public transport, they will almost never bother to travel together unless they already happen to be together and are going the same way.

There's a lot of companies (most notably google) working on ""machine learning"", which is basically artificial intelligence. A software program using machine learning gets better the more data is has, so I think you're right that these next couple years we will see a huge amount of data collection by car companies as part of an effort to build self-driving cars. 

This is probably the clearest path forward. I wonder what kind of simulation software companies like Nissan and Tesla have to test their self-driving programs on?",1426555342,cph7jy6,t3_2z9t8q,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2015
86,leafhog,"&gt; This would assume that all of those vehicles have both the necessary hardware and processing power, which I think would be unlikely.

The idea is that one year Nissan would include a bunch of safety and convenience features on all of their vehicles that have the sensors and computation power to enable full SDC, even though they don't have the software in place yet. Tesla is already doing software updates in their cars and promise the auto drive functionality as a software update (just highway driving - not full automation).

&gt; If they release millions or even just thousands of cars and get lots of good data that says they need a LIDAR on top, or the radars moved to a different position, that can easily become prohibitively expensive.

That is possible, but I think unlikely. I expect they wouldn't start this until they need the edge case data. I expect the sensors would be well tested for the 99% use cases and would be surprised if the 1% of rare situations needed something different.

&gt; As /u/Quality_Bullshit pointed out, Google and others are already using the data feedback approach, but there is a key difference between their approach and what you are saying.

QB didn't say that. I haven't read anything about Google using an approach that watches and learns from human drivers. Everything I've read about the trained human drivers is that they are there to take over when autonomous mode ends. But I could be wrong.

&gt; In your example, it would basically be a bunch of vehicles with technology that pretty much all exists commercially today, and that would somehow be able to be updated via software to make it a full SDC.

No. It would be vehicles with sensors and computation power that would be capable of self-driving. That isn't standard on all vehicles today.

88,madcuzimflagrant,"&gt;I haven't read anything about Google using an approach that watches and learns from human drivers. Everything I've read about the trained human drivers is that they are there to take over when autonomous mode ends.

That's a major part of the machine learning that QB was talking about.  Their software pays attention to when the human takes over and what he does and tries to incorporate those actions so that after enough times it can do it on its own.  This is one of the reasons Google is considered by many to be way ahead of others in this technological race.  They have a large percentage of the world's small (but growing) talent pool in this area.

As for the rest, I think you're underestimating the difficulty of going from 99% to 100%.  Musk has made many statements about this, he actually only intends to reach 90% for his upgrade (which is a factor of 10 off from that 99% and at least 3 factors of ten off from what we would need to be considered safe autonomy).  Highways are the easiest piece of the automation puzzle, and as far as I've read their planned upgrade to autopilot mode is only intended for ideal situations, so it's not even all highway driving.


&gt;No. It would be vehicles with sensors and computation power that would be capable of self-driving. That isn't standard on all vehicles today.

I didn't say it was standard, I said it exists commercially today.  The examples you gave were:
&gt;highway driving, self-parking, automatic braking for pedestrians or accident avoidance.

Tesla owners do all of those today except the highway driving, but according to them with an upgrade coming soon they'll have that too, which means a vehicle is commercially available that can potentially do all of those.  Beyond that there are many models available from many automakers that can do things like self-breaking and accident avoidance.

More importantly, we don't yet know what sensors and computational power will be necessary.  If you looks at the many dozens of designs currently being tested, they do have similarities, but they are also all different.  Everyone is taking a different approach, which yields a very likely possibility that some or many (or maybe even all) of the current configurations will prove to be insufficient for complete autonomy.  Your idea just seems like a catch 22 to me.  If we know what the hardware needs to be, that means we've done enough testing to have determined as such.   If we don't, (and obviously this is a point we disagree on) then there is a good chance with more testing we will need to change the configuration.  I don't think Nissan is going to risk charging people more money for extra sensors with the possibility that can't achieve that goal.  Auto makers are notoriously cautious with released technology, and notoriously cheap with designing something if they can't make money on it.  Not to mention the fact that they would have to get permission from each one of those drivers to obtain information from them about their driving habits.

It's not that I don't like your idea, I am a big fan of big data, and an information pool like that would be great, it just seems very impractical.  I can see information from those assist technologies getting used (and in a number of ways companies have been doing this) to improve future models, but definitely not a post-sale software update of a major mass-market car

The only situation I can envision this working in is with a very limited release of a higher-end brand with knowing participants that has the money to install a ton of sensors and pay for physical upgrades when necessary.  This is sort of happening already with the stuff Volvo has planned in Sweden, but it is a limited trial of 100 vehicles, with a non-random volunteer customer base.  It is also limited geographically and Volvo has put a lot of money and effort into other local infrastructure.

I still feel my original closing stands.  When the technology is ready, it will be sold as such.  The hardware is being improved upon every year (with a non-trivial part of that being processing power) and traditional automakers take 5 years from conception to release.  It seems significantly more likely that Google, who is by many accounts the field leader by a number of years, will develop a completed technology before a major automaker.  Whether they license or work with a traditional or non-traditional manufacturer I don't know, but by the time big auto has the right technology in place, it will be ready to sell.",1426569698,cpheval,t1_cphckts,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2015

105,cecilkorik,"Honestly I doubt motorcycles or even cars will ever be banned from all roads. As other people have pointed out elsewhere in the comments, horses and horse-drawn carriages are still legal on the vast majority of roads. I think it's likely self-driven cars will follow a similar precedent.

Once technology reaches a sufficient point, major, high speed arterial highways will likely be the first to go self-driving-cars-only, followed by major city roads and perhaps some downtown core roads. And when they do so they will begin to transition from high speed to ludicrous speed as the technology improves and speed limits become unnecessary, since the cars are no longer limited to human abilities and reaction times. These arteries will serve traffic extremely effectively due to the high speeds and tightly packed traffic capacity enabled by computer control and vehicle networking. They will likely be so effective at providing the fastest possible route to anywhere that self-driving cars will be loathe to use any other road unless there is no alternative way to reach the destination, and even then they will use the alternative roads for the shortest possible distance and it should not matter particularly much if they have to reduce to human speeds to drive on them.

Meanwhile, those roads and highways which used to be secondary routes used to relieve congestion will become all but abandoned to everything except the aforementioned handful of local traffic. It is these heavily-underutilized secondary roads that will become the ideal playgrounds for car enthusiasts. Perhaps we will even see the designation become official as some are made into recreational roads, much like parks and other recreational areas are created by decree for the people who want to take advantage of them.",1426637036,cpi90df,t1_cpi0uw7,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2015

From /u/PracticalEngineering:

&gt; It's okay to disagree with Musk on this, I surely do. The amount of blind idealists in here is pretty interesting though.
Until a car can haul and back a boat into the water, drive across my lawn without hitting my sprinklers, and perform any other random task, no, manually driving cars will never be outlawed.
What I do envision is Major highways and parts of cities that will not allow non-auto cars for the sake of safety and congestion. (No stoplights, high speeds, etc). I also envision a standard for auto manufacturers requiring all cars to have driver-less/driver-assist function eventually, but will not necessarily outlaw older cars, much like newer safety and emission standards don't restrict cars grandfathered in. Yea you might need an ""enhanced license"" if your car lacks certain features.
Furthermore you will see a lot of auto-driving public transit/taxis that will alleviate a lot of current road problems; the necessity to make self driving cars mandatory will drop off.

Also, Musk tweeted this shortly after the press conference:

&gt; To be clear, Tesla is strongly in favor of people being allowed to drive their cars and always will be. Hopefully, that is obvious.

Yet,
&gt;The car had to be driven to and from the freeway before the self-driving could be engaged and in between, **passengers needed to closely monitor how the vehicle behaved.** Instead, they would immediately check out and engage in what we can only assume is questionable behavior. Teller pointed out that people do ""really stupid stuff"" when actually driving, like texting. **So imagine what they would do when able to put their trust fully in the car itself.**

So it's safe to say they haven't ""mastered"" highway driving if they still need a human to provide oversight and take over on short notice. 

The real reason they are moving to low-speed fully autonomous vehicles is that it's very hard to do full autonomy at highway speeds. You still need that human every once in awhile. On low-speed roads, the vehicle can just stop in the middle of the road when it gets confused without consequence.

edit: He's right about people not paying attention, though. GM did some studies a couple years ago.

123,laundry_box,"Thanks for the response, I was looking to start a discussion. The reason I think it'll take some time is because access to roads is a necessity for living a modern life (in all but the most dense urban areas). For us to outlaw human driving, we need to have the self-driving infrastructure in place to accommodate *everybody*. That means farmer Joe, working-class Sally, and hillbilly Mike—all of whom may be morally against, or economically unable to take part in the self-driving world. 

I think the most likely scenario plays out like this: 

1. Some of the densest cities in the world open a few self-driving only lanes on highways into the cities—like our HOV system now. 

2. Cities centers become SDC-only zones. Small areas with unique traffic patterns, but by and large the city is still mainly human driven.

3. Entirely self-driving cities. Places like Tokyo, Manhattan, Paris will have bans on human automobiles inside their official limits.

4. Self-driving interstate system. This is where it starts to slow down. Somebody needs to put a lot of money into this to make it happen, as it'll take entirely new lanes.

5. Finally, a full out ban of human-driven cars. This will only happen when the self-driving system is built up enough that anybody, anywhere within a country can access an SDC—unlikely to happen in the near future. Look at our cell-phone coverage (though it's an imperfect comparison): most of the population in the US has coverage, but purely by land area the networks are hardly all-encompassing. An SDC network advanced enough to push out traditional automobiles would have to have *every* road in *every* state covered. This is where I think the 100-year number comes in.

We're on our way, but the transformation is not going to happen overnight. With cars from the past 5 decades still regularly putting around on our roads, it's not too far of a jump to say that it'll be 3, 4, 5 decades from when *only self-driving cars are sold* to when they become the only legal road-faring automobile.",1426780271,cpjytey,t1_cpjxos0,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2015

The same reason you'd take a taxi.

&gt; What advantages does it have from other cars I could call?

It may be cheaper, closer, faster, cleaner, look better, or otherwise fit your needs at that particular moment. 

&gt; The easiest way to lower costs is to standardize parts and maintenance; that means a fleet.

But that doesn't necessarily mean there's enough variety for people's tastes. Do rental car companies only rent one type of car? It certainly would be cheaper to do so, but they don't because people like choice.

&gt; Private fleets will have a motive for profit; public fleets will be motivated by meeting a region's transportation needs.

Both need profit to operate.

&gt; Some people like yourself can try your hand at an autonomous uber-like rental arrangement, to fill in any gaps - but I imagine LOTS of people will try that, so don't expect to make anything.

Well I probably wouldn't. I prefer my car to be private. I'm just saying it's a possibility for me because I own it.

&gt; I didn't say, myself, that there would be a five minute wait, although I think that's a completely reasonable wait time. 

That's good. I don't.

&gt; Your plan for your own vehicle is to send it home to park when not in use. Unless you never plan on going more than five minutes away from your house, you will be waiting longer than that for your car to come pick you up. Why not just jump in the nearest available car?

Because I could tell my car when to pick me up. What difference does it make how far away it is? If it's too far away to make it back on time, then obviously it wouldn't go that far away from me. But if I'm going to be at work for 8 hours it might as well go home and wait for me to be finished. 

&gt; Basically, public transportation beats private because of economies of scale and ease of use.

That's true today. That's been true since public transportation was invented. Yet people still own cars. So economies of scale and ease of use aren't the only factors, or even the most important ones.

&gt; You want to know the maintenance schedule of your car? Likely a daily cleaning and routine check.

""Likely"" isn't a guarantee at all. And daily cleanings aren't anywhere near enough in my opinion. What if some homeless guy just slept in it or some couple just fucked in it? Then it pulls up to my house and I hop in none the wiser? No thanks. I'll continue to buy cars and insurance for on demand transportation and privacy. Buses are basically self driving now.

Agreed - but Google are 'reasonably' well known and could rapidly attract a very large customer base (they know advertising quite well). They could also buy one, or more, other Transportation Network Companies that already have a significant market share (Lyft?, Sidecar? etc.). Uber are ahead, but that could easily be a tie in 5 years time.

It comes down to the self-driving technology 'secret sauce' and who brings it to market first. Right now Google appear to be winning on that one.

144,naturalredditor,"&gt;One of our projects is focused on building a fully self-driving car. If the technology could be made so that a car could drive all the places a person can drive with greater safety than when people drive in those same places, there are over a million lives a year that could be saved worldwide. Plus there’s over a trillion dollars of wasted time per year we could collectively get back if we didn’t have to pay attention while the car took us from one place to another.

&gt;When we started, we couldn’t make a list of the 10,000 things we’d have to do to make a car drive itself. We knew the top 100 things, of course. But pretty good, pretty safe, most of the time isn’t good enough. We had to go out and just find a way to learn what should be on that list of 10,000 things. We had to see what all of the unusual real world situations our cars would face were. There is a real sense in which the making of that list, the gathering of that data, is fully half of what is hard about solving the self driving car problem.

&gt;A few months ago, for example, our self-driving car encountered an unusual sight in the middle of a suburban side street. It was a woman in an electric wheelchair wielding a broom and working to shoo a duck out of the middle of the road. You can see in this picture what our car could see. I’m happy to say, by the way that while this was a surprising moment for the safety drivers in the car and for the car itself I imagine, the car did the right thing. It came autonomously to a stop, waited until the woman had shoo’d the duck off the road and left the street herself and then the car moved down the street again. That definitely wasn’t on any list of things we thought we’d have to teach a car to handle! But now, when we produce a new version of our software, before that software ends up on our actual cars, it has to prove itself in tens of thousands of situations just like this in our simulator, but using real world data. We show the new software moments like this and say “and what would you do now?” Then, if the software fails to make a good choice, we can fail in simulation rather than in the physical world. In this way, what one car learns or is challenged by in the real world can be transferred to all the other cars and to all future versions of the software we’ll make so we only have to learn each lesson once and every rider we have forever after can get the benefit from that one learning moment.

&gt;Back to the self-driving cars. The team drives a thousand miles of city streets every single day, in pursuit of moments that stump the car. We could have taken a MUCH easier path than the one we’ve chosen. Two years ago we had a perfectly good freeway commute helper. Freeway driving was easy for our cars at that point. You stay in your lane, change lanes occasionally, and don’t hit the guy in front of you — there’s the occasional poor driver who makes things a little interesting, but the car had basically mastered freeways.

&gt;In the fall of 2012, we wanted to get feedback from Googlers who weren’t on the self-driving car team. We asked people to volunteer to use our Lexus vehicles running our self-driving software during their commutes to work. We were that done, two and half years ago, that we gave people who weren’t part of [x] cars to take home and use. They could drive the Lexus to the freeway, push a button, and let the car drive, until their exit approached and they’d take back control of the car for the rest of their trip. We probably could have made a bunch of money just selling that.

&gt;But this real-world testing taught us something that steered us off that path we’d been on. Even though everyone who signed up for our test swore up and down that they wouldn’t do anything other than pay 100% attention to the road, and knew that they’d be on camera the entire time…people do really stupid things when they’re behind the wheel. They already do stupid things like texting when they’re supposed to be 100% in control…so imagine what happens when they think “the car’s got it covered.” It isn’t pretty. Expecting a person to be a reliable backup for the system was a fallacy. Once people trust the system, they trust it. Our success was itself a failure. We came quickly to the conclusion that we needed to make it clear to ourselves that the human was not a reliable backup — the car had to always be able to handle the situation. And the best way to make that clear was to design a car with no steering wheel — a car that could drive itself all of the time, from point A to point B, at the push of a button.

&gt;What’s funny is that over time, the self-driving car’s team’s success is becoming one of their biggest problems. The better you do at your job, the longer you have to wait for the next negative example that you can learn from — our cars are driving a thousand miles a day in Mountain View trying to find that next situation that we can learn from.",1426968249,cpma1na,t3_2zu17x,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2015

Hardly. Google first started to post about it in 2012, around the same time Mercedes had already came out with the highway traffic assist. Other manufacturers had also been working on it for some time. If an automaker could be first to introduce a feature everyone would insanely want, like SDC, do you seriously think they'd wait for other automakers or Google? No, they're introducing the features for self driving/autopilot as fast as their engineers can figure them out, trying to get ahead of the market.

&gt;Which means the end of car ownership for many

No it doesn't. It doesn't mean it with taxi/uber today, it won't mean it with slightly cheaper SDC taxis/uber tomorrow.

&gt;It means the end of ''premium'' for many.

Sure. 

Self driving vehicle technology is still going to be pretty expensive, right? As you mentioned, a $10K premium.

If the car is self-driving, you don't have to purchase it. You can request it on demand from Uber, Google Now (Google is now competing directly against Uber in this regard, as it was Google Ventures who invested $500MM in Uber, not Google Proper), or whatever other mobility provider is going to enter the fray with an app. That $10K premium is spread out over 100,000-250,000 miles. The *entire capital cost of the vehicle* is spread out over tens of thousands of rides.

Why would I buy a car, a depreciating asset that costs significant capital, when I can purchase my rides by the mile? Cheap miles at that! (If, of course, all electric instead of internal-combustion powered). Electric vehicles require almost no maintenance compared to an internal combustion vehicle, simplifying fleet operations (just as a roomba looks for a charger, an electric car can navigate to an open lane for charging, and return back to the roads to serve more rides when its at optimal state of charge).

Existing manufacturers can't compete against this. They can make cars with Level 1/2 autonomous capabilities (I'd argue Tesla is closest to production implementation, but whatever). Google's self-driving software is simulating 3 million miles a day in a virtual world created from scans of the real world. I'd bet on them delivering a fully autonomous vehicle in under 5 years, but you won't be able to purchase it.

TL;DR Both reduced maintenance costs and per mile costs make electric vehicles the best choice for self driving cars.

EDIT: 

You said ""They realize they can't compete on electric tech but they can compete on SDC car tech."" Laughable. On a closed track, traditional automakers could provide basic lane keeping, accident avoidance, etc. A technology company is far more capable at building and servicing fully autonomous self-driving cars than an auto manufacturer. You'll see massive consolidation in the auto industry, with 1-3 key players providing vehicles for niche markets; the rest of the world's mobility is going to be provided on-demand by a variety of car share services, served by SDCs.

166,adrianmonk,"&gt; Self driving vehicle technology is still going to be pretty expensive, right? As you mentioned, a $10K premium.

I said a $10K premium for electric, not SDC.

I see no compelling reason why SDC, once it is done at scale, needs to be particularly expensive. Fundamentally, it's sensors, compute power, and software. (I'll not count the cost of actuators because modern cars are pretty much drive-by-wire already and thus that cost is already built-in.) The per-unit manufacturing cost of software is zero. The cost of computing power is very low. The only thing that isn't obviously cheap to manufacturer is sensors, and it's quite possible those can be made for cheap as well.

&gt; If the car is self-driving, you don't have to purchase it. You can request it on demand

Put yourself in the shoes of a company actually operating such a service. They're going to have a huge capital outlay to purchase a fleet of cars. They're going to want to make revenue as quickly as possible to recoup that investment. Would they want a gasoline car that can, if necessarily, be out there driving 24x7, or would they want an electric (with current technology) has to take long breaks and sit on the sidelines while it charges? Every hour spent charging is an hour not making revenue.

Unless the problem of charging time is solved, electric cars make more sense for individuals than for fleet vehicles. Individuals don't want to spend all day in the car, so the car naturally has some convenient idle time during which it can recharge.",1427518135,cptb2i6,t1_cpta73i,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2015

$10,000 is not expensive to the majority of the 1st world buying public, particularly something that will significantly impact insurance and loss costs. Then there's the resale value factor which will be much higher. I'd pay $10,000 extra every 5 years every single time. 

&gt;If the car is self-driving, you don't have to purchase it. You can request it on demand from Uber, Google Now (Google is now competing directly against Uber in this regard, as it was Google Ventures who invested $500MM in Uber, not Google Proper), or whatever other mobility provider is going to enter the fray with an app. 

I really don't get this argument. I have interest in buying my own SDC, not paying an SDC fleet and then sitting on someone else's farts, with their food trash and having to install my kid's car seat every single time I take her somewhere, not to mention the wait times in my driveway for a car to arrive and having to wait longer because higher paying users need to get to a major sporting event or festival.  My aunts and uncles returned to the US after a vacation and didn't factor in the SuperBowl weekend, they all got stranded together at CLT with packed hotels in every direction because a bunch of domestic flights got canceled so that higher paying SuperBowl attendees could be flown into Arizona. Airlines work on a very similar model to proposed SDC fleet logistics.  I could spend that $10,000 premium on Uber or taxi or a chauffeured car service right now, but I don't because it's impractical for my lifestyle, which is a fairly typical suburban one.

&gt;Why would I buy a car, a depreciating asset that costs significant capital, when I can purchase my rides by the mile?

Why do people own cars right now?  You don't think fleet SDCs will be depreciating assets? You'll be paying more per mile than ownership on average because you'll be funding a service.  We attribute a car's value to its mileage as much as the age.  Typically fleet vehicles are practically worthless by the time they're at the end of a five year service life. Meanwhile a personally owned Japanese vehicle can still be worth 60% of its initial value after 5 years. 

&gt;Electric vehicles require almost no maintenance compared to an internal combustion vehicle, simplifying fleet operations

(I am ignoring the SDC = Electric non sequitur for now) Maintaining complex machinery is usually a reason for choosing a fleet service over personal ownership. Simpler maintenance makes ownership *more* practical. ",1427557222,cptlch4,t1_cpta73i,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2015

I honestly don't think that this is something that can be solved without more consistent infrastructure in the form of machine readable devices embedded in the roadways. Or at the very least, strictly standardized roadside markings that would allow computers to triangulate position to within inches.

It's not that unlikely a prospect. Those road reflectors in between lanes cost a couple dollars a piece. Mass produced magnets (or more likely RFIDs) could easily match that price point. The real costs will be installing them. But eventually it will simply be part of how roads are constructed, and be a minimal additional expense.

The child would be declared at fault and no lawsuit would be filed.

The issue here is that people don't like having to think about making difficult decisions. They want to pretend that such things won't happen, and when they do, they want to have the sudden immediacy of it absolve away the guilt. Coldly planning out which is the best of bad choices ahead of time is not something people want, or like to do. However our discomfort is a problem with us, not the technology.

178,YouAintGotToLieCraig,"There are other ethical situations where the pedestrian isn't at fault. What if a car coming the opposite way swerves right in front of you at the last second. Your self-driving car can brake all it wants, but it may have to swerve in order to avoid the collision. Now what if there are pedestrians on the sidewalk of the road?  What would probably happen in that situation, is that the car will allow the collision to happen since cars are designed for hitting each other, and there would be nothing to protect swerving into the pedestrians. That seems like the logical choice but there is another argument to be made too. Should the car protect the driver at all costs? The driver is surrendering themselves and giving all trust and control in this car. Would it be ethical for it to allow the driver to be hurt over other people who aren't involved with the car?

The reason people are talking about these hypothetical situations, is because they will have to be decided before the situation becomes a reality. These conditions will have to be explicitly set in the ""rules"" (logic). This isn't an area where we can say ""we'll see what happens"". These kind of decisions will have to be explicitly laid out and I think that's what people get hung up on.

Another angle; cars can drive reasonably well on snow/ice if they have snow tires. Some jurisdictions already mandates that everyone has snow tires during winter months, but that's an expensive solution when most cars are parked 90%+ of the time. It will be much cheaper to just equip all self-driving taxis with snow tires during winter seasons.

190,arewar,"&gt;But what happens in the beginning when only 5% of cars are self driving. 

The SDCs are being developed with this expectation. A change to SDC is going to be very slow and gradual (unless the government interferes).

&gt;What happens when the said car gets in to an accident with a driven car. Sure it's the drivers fault, but people are dumb and they will blame the new technology. 

Blaming a SDC would really be no different than blaming another driver for an accident. Police investigations and so on would happen to determine the real cause. 

If for some reason it is proven that the technology is at fault, then the same thing happens when normal cars are faulty. There have been many instances of this in the past - faulty breaks, faulty airbags, etc. The companies pay significant fines and do recalls.

&gt;But then the manufacturers will try to prove that their autonomous vehicle is perfect using the data recorder. Then the people will say that the car makers are spying on them and taking away their freedom. 

This seems pretty extreme. What is a SDC going to be recording (assuming it comes to this)? Things like speed, vehicle maintenance, maybe something to the extreme of a dashcam. 

Yes, some people will cry like babies. People cry about everything. But all of that information being available is a positive. 

If they for some reason cross a line - like recording conversations in the car or something? - laws fix that. (If the competition doesn't. If I know car A records my conversations but car B does not, I'm probably buying car B.)

&gt;What happens when a software update is released and there is a bug?

This is unlikely, but of course not impossible. Because of the risk factors, regulations regarding SDC are going to be extremely strict.

Just like Airplanes. These are mostly automated these days. No one is all that concerned about auto-pilot bugging out.

But assuming it does happen, same thing I mentioned above. It's treated the same as a defective car. 

&gt; Or worst what if he cars get hacked.

Well, first off that would be a felony. So it's a criminal investigation unrelated to SDC. The question becomes more along the lines are SDCs safe enough to handle something bad happening - airbags, etc.

You have to keep in mind all of these bad things discussing are being mentioned as failures of the technology. Let's keep in mind that there will be other types of failure too. What if a deer runs out in front of the car? A SDC isn't guaranteed to be able to stop in time. What if a tire blows out and it runs into a light pole?

All of these are normal factors.

The real meaning of all of these questions is ""who is responsible for problems when there is no driver"". And that is a fair concern, because if the driver is no longer in control then they feel they are not responsible. (Despite a blow-out of a tire or a deer isn't really the driver's fault either when they are in control...?)

Do the manufacturers of the cars absorb that responsibility? Partially, yes. They will be scrutinized to have even stronger safety features and quality assurance. But the others? That's probably going to shift to insurance companies.

But is this typical system going to remain in place? That's probably the biggest question! What if Google creates their own car insurance provider? Suddenly insurance becomes a part of a typical car buying process, just like a warranty. Maybe even just becomes a part of a warranty. I imagine a lot of car insurance companies are just going to go out of business (for more reasons than this).

Odds are manufacturers will just be the insurance purchasers instead of the drivers. Drivers will file 'insurance' claims to the manufacturers when things go wrong.",1427985518,cpyw1z8,t3_315y2f,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2015

I guess that explains why suburbs are so unpopular then....

I agree with these negative aspects, but the fact of the matter is that suburbs are hugely popular for a host of reasons - and the suburban population has voted with their feet and their money.

In suburbia fully autonomous vehicles could significantly impact on social isolation (some that are disabled, seniors, hit hard times would have more reliable and affordable access to road transportation) and the consequent boredom.

Where there is a choice then those that want walkable neighbourhoods will be able to choose walkable.  And those that want suburbia will be able to choose suburbia.

In both instances fully autonomous vehicles can improve quality of life. 

We can't just un-invent suburbia. But we can seek to create walkable neighbourhoods that are so attractive that we see a population shift.

In terms of car services being cheaper because there are no ownership costs (e.g., lease payments,  insurance,  maintenance, etc.), you will still have to pay for those things,  they will just be hidden in the fee you pay for a ride. I also don't know of any companies that employee no people, so you will also be paying for their benefits and salaries as well as overhead and profit for the company.  Sure, there may be some efficiencies of scale,  but the company that owns the cars *will pass those costs on to the consumer*.

I think you're 100% correct - car ownership in the next few decades will definitely benefit from some of the same efficiencies. And the fleet companies will absolutely pass the cost onto the consumer, because that's the only sensical thing to do. But many of these base costs will go down over time with electric autonomous vehicles as well, and efficiencies of scale shouldn't be underestimated. E.g.

* Insurance costs will drop with far fewer accidents. Insurance costs for human drivers will likely stay the same.
* Well designed electric vehicles have far fewer moving parts (see: Model S), and are easier to maintain, leading to fewer failures, and easier maintenance

&gt; you can already buy a car with no fossil fuel costs, so I don't see what that has to do with SDC services

True that they're available today! But again, as we see battery technology improve over the next few decades, I believe that hybrid, and eventually all electric vehicles will become more commonplace. What we really need is one good leap in battery technology to carry us forward.

Also, as autonomous technology becomes more commonplace over the next few decades, competition will drive ever-decreasing profit margins, leading to cheaper prices for the consumer.

&gt; I've had an electric car and solar panels to charge it for the last 2 years

Awesome! Do you have pictures of that setup anywhere / any photo story of getting it up and running? How much does your solar setup offset your charging cost?

&gt; Your other points about availability, saving time, safety would all be true or even better for an self driving car that a person owns as opposed to calling on a fleet vehicle for a ride for example, no matter how good a car service is, my own personal car will be more available.

I think this is potentially true, but then we're right back to one of the first ideas: If most other things were equal (except for probably maintenance / reliability), what's the appeal in paying a large up-front cost for something that you won't use the vast majority of the time, when you could just be paying for it during the time that you use it?

232,TheAngryPlatypus,"&gt; No down payment on a vehicle, no monthly payments, no vehicle leasing costs. You only pay for what you use

As a rule you generally only pay for what you use now. Depreciation is calculated as cost/miles driven. A car lasts roughly the same number of miles whether it is driven by one person or ten; 10,000 miles a year or a hundred. Something like 80% of the cost of operating a vehicle is directly tied to the number of miles traveled. 

It's a complicated issue, but certainly not a clear win for shared fleets, as shared fleets also *add* a number of expenses. 

&gt;No fossil fuel costs, as vehicles will be all electric...No need to pay hundreds of $$ per month on auto insurance

While these are certainly nice benefits, the same benefits would also apply to privately owned electric autonomous vehicles. 

&gt;Cleaner and better for the environment

Again, pretty much a wash between privately owned and fleet service. 

&gt;Available whenever you need a vehicle

Availability of a privately owned vehicle is extremely high--even more so if you can summon it with your smartphone. 

&gt;Saving drivers time, by having to worry about finding parking

Not much of an issue if your car can drop you off and park itself. 

&gt;Faster on both surface streets and freeways than human drivers...Orders of magnitude safer than human drivers

Again, how do these not apply to a privately owned self driving car? 

&gt;0 maintenance for the consumer - without owning a car, you'll never take your car to the shop again

A potential benefit, and certainly one area fleets can save money is on maintenance by doing their own and economies of scale, but electric vehicles will be more reliable anyway and you can always send it to the shop while you're at work to get itself fixed so it should be much less of a hassle than it is today. Also fleet service will almost certainly exist most places as an option, so if your car is in the shop for a couple of days no big deal. 

You make the mistake I see time and time again on this thread of conflating the advantages of fleet service, self driving cars, and electric vehicles. They are all separate issues, and fleet service is *not* the only way to get the advantages from the other two.

250,TheAngryPlatypus,"&gt;People on here keep saying self-driving cars will be good, car ownership won't be necessary, but is that really true?

First I want to make sure you're not conjoining self driving cars with the death of car ownership. Obviously it makes self driving fleets possible, but there's no reason that should preclude personal ownership of a self driving car for those that so desire. Personal ownership will undoubtedly be more prevalent in rural areas.

&gt; well, you absolutely need to drive, where am is sparsely populated at best, no streetlights, and weather is particularly bad at times, in winter.

There's no reason to believe a viable, commercial self driving car won't be able to handle these situations at least as well if not better than a human driver. Yes, there are current challenges with weather, but there is a lot of advances left to make before products are released and they've just started addressing these problems. 

&gt;it's just impractical and unenforcable to get every car to be an SDC in the future, things like public opinion, political pressures etc. 

It's not going to happen overnight. Public opinion and political pressure changes. Get back to me after a generation or two has grown up largely not even bothering to get a driver's license and see what public opinion is. 

&gt;Also, car ownership makes loads of £££'s for the Government...Would governments really want to stop one of their major revenue sources?

Self driving cars can also save government plenty on infrastructure. At any rate it's not like the government can't just raise other vehicle fees to offset any lost income. You seem to be really stuck on the notion that everything will stay the same. 

&gt;What do you think? Would an SDC be useful in rural areas?

Possibly not as useful, so adoption may take longer. But I suspect that, as things are more spread out in rural areas there may be some unique advantages, especially for those incapable of driving. In the city if you have bad eyesight and can't drive you can probably walk to the market. In the suburbs your kids soccer practice is probably a couple of miles down the road. In rural areas you can use a self driving car for this. It may also make delivery services more viable, which is even more handy when things aren't convenient. 

Also who wouldn't rather read a book, play PS4, or surf Reddit on the hour drive into civilization?

Most cities in the US are predominantly suburban, by a fairly wide margin, actually, and a few thousand new people per year moving into the inner city doesn't change the overall trend towards the suburbs that much. 

Beyond that, I think the reason for the conflicting arguments that you are seeing is that the city vs suburb dichotomy is become more and more irrelevant, at least in the US. This is because areas that were considered suburban 20 or more years ago are looking more and more urban as time goes by, even if they aren't quite considered urban today. 

Ultimately,  I don't see self-driving cars changing population densities much. Being able to reclaim driving time for more productive pursuits should result in  some people being willing to accept longer commutes and longer trips to stores and entertainment, but how much time are people really willing to sit in the car, driverless or not, and at what cost? Ultimately most people will still want to live in relatively close proximity to places they go regularly--think today's suburbs.

More people will get it yes, but not everyone. $1k is a *lot* of money to some people. Also, those on the poor end of the spectrum aren't going to be considering new cars at all. It will take a good span of time for SDC to enter the used car market widely.

&gt;But now they're all pretty ubiquitous safety features of cars. SDC technology will be similar.

I agree... but at the same time, all those items are ubiquitous because they are legally required now.

&gt;SDCs can fail safe, meaning if they break they do the safest thing possible to ""limp"" to safety. Also, there are so many systems in automobiles that a part breaking won't necessarily disable the entire vehicle. For instance, my friend's Cadillac has a broken gas gauge, 4 worn out brakes, a tire with a slow leak, a minor oil leak, and a major transmission leak, and the car is still driveable and quite smooth. 

I was using ""break"" very loosely. What I was more leaning towards was the average person's perception of these items. For example, if the battery on your phone overheats and kills your phone (ie. *the technology fails*), it sucks but it's probably not life threatening. In an SDC, your life is reliant on that technology and that by nature makes the average joe more wary of adopting the technology.

You could also probably compare it to vaccines. It took quite awhile for people to adopt them and take them regularly, but now they are pretty wide spread and the safety is proven. Yet there's still some idiots out there shouting death and destruction and government nanobots in your blood stream.

&gt;People buy cars pretty frequently, about every 5-10 years max.

Ooooooh you're perception is way off here my friend. I'm driving a 2003 Ford currently. My husband was driving a '93 Toyota until a couple months ago. 10 years is about the *minimum* people keep their cars now. [Source](http://budgeting.thenest.com/people-trade-cars-30494.html). And in my opinion that number will keep falling.

266,Airazz,"I disagree. We already have self-driving cars. You get in, tell it where you want to go and it takes you there. You're free to read/play/sleep during your journey. They're called taxis. 

And those taxi cars still need to be manufactured by someone. 

Another reason is that I want a car that fits me and that is always here when I need it. I don't want to wait 15 minutes for a taxi (even if it's without a human driver) just to go to the store that is 10 minutes away. 

Third reason: car sharing already exists here. You just grab a car from one of many dedicated parking lots, drive it as much as you want, drop it off in any other dedicated parking spot (there are many around the city) and your credit card is charged automatically, for the distance and time that you used. It's not very popular because using your own car (especially if you drive a lot) is cheaper.

Why is it cheaper? Because you don't have to generate a profit for anyone when you're using your own car. ",1429474998,cqhrius,t3_333kov,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2015

268,LessonStudio,"The decline will come in waves with the first few waves actually being a boon to the car industry. 

The first wave will be when people start replacing good cars with driverless cars before they would otherwise have replaced those cars. This will only grow as the cars become more widely recognized as a brilliant idea.

Then there will be a few more bursts while the cars dramatically improve, not only in their self driving abilities but as cars that are self driving start to change in their very nature and adapt to this new reality (I am thinking mobile livingrooms).

Another wave of buyers will be those presently denied driving, the blind, the old, the too young, the disabled, and those who's legal difficulties (drinking) have caused them to lose their licence. 

Then there will be one last orgy sized wave when manual cars start to become recognized as the cause of pretty much all road suffering and are first shunned and then banned. (Think cigarettes on airplanes in the 70s).

But once manual cars are largely off the roads the whole game becomes instantly worse. For one cars instantly become far easier to build as they shed much of the safety gear that presently weighs down modern cars. This is not only hard to build but hard to get approved. Then there is the fact that old school designers will have trouble wrapping their heads around the overall design of the driverless car. For this look at the days of cellphones just before the iPhone; there were literally about 2 dozen fundamental designs with flips, slides, rotates, dual screens, etc But then once the iPhone came out pretty much every company went touch screen slab. The key takeaway was that nearly all the unstoppable giants were slain that day; Motorola, Nokia, Blackberry, etc. All pretty much now dead with the phone industry nobody Apple now king. 
With the simpler vehicle it becomes fantastically easier for a tiny upstart to design a radically new vehicle. And when I say tiny upstart again I mean either a company that gets bought by a technology giant or a tiny department in a technology giant. Apple is rumoured to have a car in the works but it literally could be almost anyone who realizes that they have the correct solution. It won't come early in the game but it will come just as the old school auto makers are sitting pretty on all these new sales because they are coming up with exciting new designs every year that are driving sales hard. Then voop, all their sales will fly over to a single new company and they are all pretty much instantly dead. They might make their also-rans but they will probably look at the new design and say, ""Pfshaw that won't work, people don't want that."" and will be slow to realize that they must copy the design as fast as is humanly possible. 

My last prediction is also predicated that this new design will be an electric car, in that many cars will be electric by this time but it also massively simplifies the design and assembly. This would allow this upstart to pound out millions of these vehicles shockingly fast.



Then there is the whole concept of even owning a vehicle. If taxis/rentals are driverless then why own a vehicle that you will call to your location if you can just call a fleet car? Right now with a taxi you are calling an expensive vehicle where you have to pay a driver, but not only for the driver's time while they drive you but potentially their time on a return journey and you actually have to factor in their waiting time into the price of the drive. With driverless cars you will be getting into a very cheap vehicle with no driver. With these fleet vehicles most people won't care which brand of machine they get into as long as it is clean and reliable. This will massively damage the ""My vehicle is better and thus makes me better than you"" marketing. I am not saying that nobody will own cars but it would again be like smoking in that the numbers will plummet and keep dropping for a very long time until it is narrowed down to those who just can't give up private ownership.

So in summary, the next decade or so will be called the golden age of car sales, but the next decade after that will have kids asking, ""What was a Ford again?""

269,TheAngryPlatypus,"I thought we had finally wrapped our head around this concept. 

The way you reduce the number of cars you need to manufacture is to either increase how many miles a vehicle will last for, or reduce the number of miles that people drive. 

Self driving cars do little to increase the mileage lifetime of vehicles, and might actually encourage people to drive more. Yes, fleet service could significantly reduce the number of cars on the road at any given time, but you have to replace a car that travels 100,000 miles per year much more frequently than you do a vehicle that is driven 10,000 miles per year. 

Now it may well have a huge impact on the auto industry, but self driving vehicles technology won't significantly reduce the number of vehicles that need to be manufactured. ",1429502710,cqi6abj,t3_333kov,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2015

272,TheAngryPlatypus,"&gt; Taxis tend to run up higher mileages than private cars today already. 

Not that much longer from what I've seen, and a large part of that is that the internal combustion engine benefits from an ""always on"" duty cycle. This is not a factor with electric vehicles, which I believe will be in wide use by the time self driving vehicles also command a significant share of the market. 

The other big reason is fleet vehicles are usually impeccably maintained compared to privately owned vehicles. That's not directly an impact of self driving cars though, and while that factor isn't likely to go away it may be reduced when your car can drive itself to the shop while you're at work or sleeping. Again, electric vehicles require less maintenance in general, which may have an impact. 

Also all we can do is guess what percentage of the market will be replaced by fleet service. Many of the factors have no impact at all if the self driving car is privately owned, and that will undoubtedly account for at least part of the market. 

Finally we have to account for the very real possibility people may travel substantially more with self driving cars. 

Bottom line, while there are lots of factors that could have an impact, it's very difficult to conclude there will be any significant reduction in the number of cars that will be manufactured and sold at this point. ",1429538996,cqihegy,t1_cqih240,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2015

276,TheAngryPlatypus,"&gt; Electric vehicles will likely have longer lifespans.

You missed the point. Fleet vehicles with internal combustion engines last somewhat longer than privately owned internal combustion vehicles because starting and stopping them--like you do with a privately owned vehicle--makes for more wear and tear on the engine. 

Electric vehicles may last longer, but they will last longer whether they are fleet vehicles or privately owned, and they will no longer have that specific advantage. It's a net loss of advantage for fleet vehicles from ICE to electric. 

Everything I see points towards there being less of an advantage to fleet service than there is today, although there will be way more fleet vehicles in general so it's possible the net effect could go up still. 

Combined that with the fact I don't believe there's that significant a difference today. If anybody has hard numbers I'd be interested in seeing them. You can find how long taxis or what not are usually driven for and it's not an impressive number, but those vehicles are frequently sold and driven more privately. Current privately owned vehicles last for an average of 200,000 miles. I'd be surprised if fleet vehicles weren't closer to 200k than 250k. 

I really don't think the longevity of fleet vehicles will be the death knell for automakers, and I don't see any significant reduction in sales numbers. What seems like it could more likely be a problem for automakers is: 

1. Fleets negotiating a lower profit margin for vehicles; and
2. Going for more frugal, smaller, utilitarian vehicles. 

Still, I don't think it's that bad for automakers. Current fleets don't get that significant of a discount, and selling vehicles in large chunks is more efficient for automakers as well. As for types of vehicles on the road I can certainly see that going both ways. I see little demand for a 400hp engine, for example, but I can actually see demand for other kinds of luxuries in self driving vehicles increasing as people have more time to spend using functionality inside the vehicle.

I personally don't think that car sharing will be a thing. Public transport already deals with it quite well and it's way more effective and efficient than cars. 

Self-driving cars will probably work like airplanes, where the difficult stuff is overwatched by the driver and all the boring part will be done by autopilot.

280,TheAngryPlatypus,"&gt;Significantly reduced accident rates will greatly increase the average lifetime of cars.

Ah, I did forget about that, but it's not as big of a difference as you would think, as I've researched it before. Something like 1 in 4 vehicles is ultimately scrapped, but while that sounds substantial you have to remember that the vast majority of vehicles scrapped are near the end of their life anyway. It's hard to do enough damage to a $30,000 vehicle that it has to be scrapped. It's really easy to do enough damage to a $2,000 vehicle that it has to be scrapped. 

Also a fairly high percentage of that figure is due to weather related issues (flood, hail, tornado, etc) or other damage which  likely to be prevented by self driving technology. 

So will it be a factor? Yes. But I don't think it's fair to say it will greatly increase the average lifetime of all vehicles though. Let's say 15% of all vehicles are ultimately in an accident that causes the vehicle to be scrapped, and those vehicles have an average of 50,000 miles left in them, and self driving vehicles reduce that number by 90%. That's a 3% increase in overall vehicle mileage lifetime. 

I'm somewhat pulling numbers out of my ass, but no matter what it's still going to be a relatively small (but significant) number.

SDCs by themselves don't do that much to reduce the demand for cars. Yes, assuming a large percentage of people opt for shared fleet service over privately owned vehicles it *can* reduce the number of cars on the road at any given time dramatically. But as those cars are used much more heavily they wear out much quicker as well. 

You reduce the number of cars that have to be manufactured by either increasing the number of miles vehicles last, or decreasing the number of miles people travel. Whether a car is used for 200,000 miles in 2 years in a shared fleet before being scrapped or 200,000 miles over 20 years by a single driver is irrelevant to how many cars you have to manufacture. 

It's true there are some factors that may allow shared fleet vehicles to last somewhat longer, and if ride sharing takes off it could reduce the effective number of miles people travel, but not to the degree to put an entire industry out of business. It's also quite possible people will actually travel more with the advent of self driving vehicles, which would be a factor for increasing demand for vehicles.

So, why do you want crashes? Please explain it to me. For the freedom to modify your SDC? What would you gain from modding it?

If it can then people will trust it so much that they will close the curtains and go to sleep. Or it can't and it will never be put into cars. If it can't and people put it into cars then everyone would just have nervous breakdowns waiting for it to screw up. Try driving through a rotary with a brand new learner driver. So handing control to a human driver so they can do something like go through tall grass that the car refuses to do will be something where it is about an easy problem to solve as possible. You need a tiny handful of rules such as don't do it on highways, don't do it at high speed, don't do it unless the user has clearly indicated that they are willing to take the conn.

So maybe a few extra technologies will be needed so that if an accident does happen (road collapses, car breaks down in the middle of the road etc) then a signal can be issued to all cars in the area that something is up and everyone will slow down to speeds where manual control is available and thus they can steer around a problem using their judgement. This could be used for construction as well.

I have another photo of NY 5th Avenue in 1913 - it is packed full and if you look closely you can't find any horses - only lots and lots of automobiles.

The modern automobile was patented in about 1886 by Karl Benz.

So there is a precedent that rapid change can occur on our roads in only a few decades.

But bear in mind the compelling business case behind fully self-driving vehicles - that those who deploy them will likely gain market share (taxis, car rental, car share, ride share, TNCs [Uber, Lyft etc.)) and that those that don't will lose market share.

Then of course the couch entrepreneur can buy one and hire it out through the cloud.

Then there is the fact that one fully self-driving vehicle can replace anywhere from 2 to 13 private vehicles, and so unlike when the horse and carriage was replaced 1-for-1 we will see massively leveraged market penetration here.

There are at least another dozen compelling reasons/business cases why demand to deploy fully self-driving cars will be much greater than the ability to supply them.

Personally - I think most assessments of market penetration rates are way too cautious.

But unfortunately, this subreddit has a bunch of users who will freely violate good reddiquette and downvote you for disagreeing with their *optimistic projections*.

Some of my own projections:

* **Miles driven will double at least.**  There is pent up demand for travel which is prevented today by the need to stop what you're doing and manage the car.  The opportunity cost of the driver is higher than the cost of the mechanical systems and fuel to move the car.  We're going to find lots of trips happen because suddenly busy people, young people, the elderly can hop into a self-driving car and go.
* **Traffic will get much, much worse** (but safer).  Traffic systems do not respond linearly to demand.  Doubling the miles driven will create gridlock in some places and massive slowdowns in others.
* People will want comfort, familiarity, and access to continue their lives in the places where they spend 4+ hours per day.  They will want to sleep, to eat, to work out, while the computer chauffeur them around.  Tiny cars are never going to meet this demand, so **cars will get larger.**
* Sleeping in other people's beds is not appealing, and moving those beds to the car will not improve that.  People will want to have their own things with them.  You can't bring your 800 pounds of personal stuff with you in a public taxi.  While taxi fleets may exist, they'll suffer from most of the issues that already keep people out of public transportation.  **People who can will still own cars.**

Exactly - not many on this forum are promoting the idea of simply removing the human driver but retaining the current ownership and usage model.

Self-driving VEHICLES (SDVs) can take many forms and many operational and use cases - far more flexible than current cars/vehicles.

SDVs can be made to be our servant and not our master as they currently seem to have become in some of the more congested cities. We can set the rules so that pedestrians and cyclists have priority when SDVs are around if it suits us. We can regain quality of life by slowing SDVS down in walkable areas and moving to electric/low(or no) emission propulsion.

SDVs can be a much more efficient and cost-effective replacement for existing transit - being an on-demand and point to point service.

SDVs can provide much more affordable, accessible and equitable  transportation to the 30% that either can't drive or don't have a licence - including some that are disabled, seniors, too young, too old, too poor, medically-at-risk, unlicensed etc.

Couldn't agree more with regards to the physical dimensions of self-driving CARS. 

Except they will be able to travel more closely if they are allowed to, and move in a more synchronised way through intersections. So that might increase road capacity in terms of people moved.

Plus if we promote shared automated vehicles (SAVs) and see average vehicle occupancy rise from around 1.2 now to 1.8 in the future then that would significantly increase road capacity to move people.

But are we limited to self-driivng CARS?... No, we are not. So we could 2-wheel, 2-person SAVS  that take up considerably less space. We could have SAV taxis with 4 private compartments that allow the discerning traveller more options - and would be much more efficient than 4 equivalent current taxis.

We could have SAVs that have 6,8, 10+ seats, automated buses.

All SAVs being capable of providing an on-demand door-to-door service, which during peak periods would be much less stressful than a private car, parking, fuel, maintenance etc.  And the more people that use SAVs, the higher average vehicle occupancy rises, the less vehicles on the road at a given time, then less congestion, less emissions (especially if electric which SAVs are very suited to) which means much more road capacity to move people.

So yes - there are a heap of things that mean self-driving VEHICLES will take up a lot less space on the road. 

Btw - Baidu are working on self-driving bicycles that deliver themselves to you - and they will be much safer to ride in SAV traffic which could be programmed to give peds and bicyclists priority if we want.

As for the point about automobile deaths, well, deaths can come from other things like power tools, electrocution etc. but you don't see anti-DIY crusaders do you? Alcohol can cause death, but if Prohibition was re-enacted, there'd be massive protests, wouldn't there? There's no reason to say deaths won't be stopped even with self-driving cars, after all, we have trains that are semi-automated, and people still commit suicide on the tracks, and children playing chicken on the roads.

The NRA and Internet privacy/ personal privacy activists and libertarians (non-capital L) have huge political power, what's to say that drivers won't as well? Even the police might complain about loss of revenue.

Plus, marques like Porsche, Lamborghini, Ferrari etc. aren't the brands who would need to sell an SDC, since they sell on speed and performance as their USP. I doubt few people would want an SDC Ferrari.

Perhaps will future car showrooms be more like that of boutiques, tailored service etc., rather than the way they are today?

&gt; In hardware terms, the truck isn&amp;#039;t much different from the latest trucks and passenger cars Daimler is putting on the road. A stereoscopic camera reads lane lines.

&gt; In his book Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future, Martin Ford writes, &amp;quot;While the trucks may indeed soon be able to essentially drive themselves, the staggering destructive potential of these vehicles probably means that someone is going to remain in the driver&amp;#039;s seat for the foreseeable future.&amp;quot; That&amp;#039;s Daimler&amp;#039;s line, too,.

&gt; With time, autonomous features-both in trucks and in passenger cars-will prove themselves far safer and more efficient than the human driver model.

Because of that, the different schools - elementary, junior high, high school - have to start at different times so the buses can get back to the neighborhood for each group. SDCs or small self driving buses would help this issue, and all the schools could start at about the same time. 

Parental supervision may be a problem, but install video cameras and that should minimize most behavior issues. As for choking, or other emergencies, this could still occur at home while the parent is in the other room. I'm not sure having an adult, especially if they are not trained (and I'm not sure how many bus drivers are trained in basic emergency medicine). If these self driving mini-buses are specific for students going to school, they could have emergency/drive to closest hospital buttons that a child would press in an emergency. This would probably be the best resolution to an emergency - i.e. drive to hospital or local EMT dispatch location.

Weather doesn't change in 3 seconds, and all environmental conditions are detectable with current technology. But like I said earlier, level 3 will be here one day and you'll be proven wrong. For some reason you also believe the car will simply not function if the SDC function isn't active. I know people with convertibles in Michigan that can't open their top 3 to 8 months of the year. Or people who own motorcycles and scooters. I had 22"" wheels on a Suburban up there that I had to take off and replace with snow tires every year. What's the difference? Either way it's a function of your car that's unusable temporarily because you chose to live in a shitty part of the world. People don't seem to mind not opening their convertible tops and don't mind changing to snow tires, so why would they really mind if the road is covered with snow a few days out of the year? The shit get plowed eventually anyway, so you're talking about a narrow window of time where the snow is actually falling. It's not safe for anybody to drive in those conditions, so the car never would on its own. That's a limitation, but one that I'm sure people can live with. Geez, you're making a big deal about a limitation of a technology that has a million other benefits. As if it only has one type of sensor for seeing the road. My car has 3 and it's nowhere near self driving. You sound like people talking about how dangerous the automobile was and how nobody would ever be able to afford it.

351,StarManta,"The basic question is, what percentage of shipping costs go to the driver? I didn't know, honestly, so I googled it, and found [this infographic](http://www.thetruckersreport.com/infographics/cost-of-trucking/). It says that 26% of the cost of shipping goes to the salary of the drivers.

What about the other costs? Well, let's assume that self driving trucks are more efficient, especially if they are allowed to cluster together and draft off each other as /u/unmisunderestimated suggested. Fuel is 39% of the total cost of shipping, and he suggests that 30% can be saved this way. Multiply those, there's another 13%.

Finally, insurance is 4% of this cost. It remains to be seen how self-driving will affect insurance rates, but I've always believed this will be a huge change. I'll optimistically say that that 4% will be cut down to a 2%.

So, if you exclude the cost of the self-driving system itself (which, over time, will get cheaper and cheaper until it's negligible), you have 26% + 13% + 2% = 41% reduction in shipping costs, in the long run.

This assumes that the system uses a very similar model to what we have today, though. There's no reason this has to be true. For example, a self-driving, electric truck using a chassis design similar to a Tesla could have the shipping container attached directly to the top of the vehicle, eliminating a) gas and b) the need for a cab. I'm no expert, but I think that combining the purpose of the cab into the ""wheel"" part of the trailer could dramatically reduce maintenance costs. Being electric could obviously reduce fuel costs, and the trucks could use a Supercharger-style network to charge themselves. Since you don't have to pay a salary to a guy waiting for the car to charge, this doesn't cost much money, it only slows down the speed of the shipment by probably 10-15% - this is generally much less than you have to stop and wait for a driver to sleep overnight.

(Yes, batteries aren't cheap, but big rigs are already pretty expensive (generally at least $100k) and with the Gigafactory singlehandedly doubling the world's production of batteries, those will be plummeting in price over the next few years. The more you drive an EV, the more you save in fuel expenses, and nothing gets driven more than a big rig. A semi consumes $70k of fuel per year - you could throw $200k worth of batteries into a truck and come out ahead in the long run.)

If we combine electrics with self-driving in this way, we could probably ship things for 60-70% less than what we pay for it today.",1430960284,cr0wcly,t3_353p8r,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2015
352,ObiWanBaloney,I work for a trucking company. Once self driving trucks become common we won't need anywhere near the number of office staff either. Most of them exist because of humans.

Driving is a pretty hard job so you'll lose even more drivers when many refuse to work for the new pay levels.

357,Zakalwen,"There's already been some great replies, a few points to add to them:

1) The hours of service rules seem maddeningly complicated at first glance, they'd be almost completely done away with using SDV. No need for rest breaks, a SDV can potentially drive 24 hours a day. That could almost double the time a truck is on the road allowing more deliveries to be made in the same amount of time (upper end say 50% more deliveries though obviously relies on people being able to receive the goods. Perhaps with self driving forklifts to load and unload this wouldn't be much of a problem).

2) In many cases I don't think you can completely get rid of someone in the cab. If you have an important package to deliver to a difficult to access area (i.e. blood for a hospital) you might need to include a courier in the mix. However as all they need to do is walk the final few steps expect this to be a minimum wage job (hell sounds like not a bad one for uni students in summer)

3) Having said that I can easily see how most delivery people would be eliminated. A package delivery car could arrive outside your house/flat/work and ring you to tell you it's arrived and where it is. To access your package you'll have to type in a confirmation code or swipe the card you used to order for a compartment to open with just your package.",1430994158,cr18v9p,t3_353p8r,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2015

&gt; You spent time at Google—what’s your view on self-driving cars?

&gt; I sat close to that team and I’m friends with a lot of them, so I have a sense of what they’re doing. But I was not contributing directly to them.

&gt; I think self-driving cars are a little further out than most people think. There’s a debate about which one of two universes we’re in. In the first universe it’s an incremental path to self-driving cars, meaning you have cruise control, adaptive cruise control, then self-driving cars only on the highways, and you keep adding stuff until 20 years from now you have a self-driving car. In universe two you have one organization, maybe Carnegie Mellon or Google, that invents a self-driving car and bam! You have self-driving cars. It wasn’t available Tuesday but it’s on sale on Wednesday.

&gt; I’m in universe one. I think there’s a lot of confusion about how easy it is to do self-driving cars. There’s a big difference between being able to drive a thousand miles, versus being able to drive anywhere. And it turns out that machine-learning technology is good at pushing performance from 90 to 99 percent accuracy. But it’s challenging to get to four nines (99.99 percent). I’ll give you this: we’re firmly on our way to being safer than a drunk driver.

Another expert in the maybe 20 years away camp.  So many people here seem to think Tesla is magically going to give us self-driving cars in the next few years, or Google less magically (unlike Tesla, at least Google has a significant in-house research program).

* You get sued for product defects 1000 times because people got injured in the vicinity of you SDCs.  That costs you $Y (most of this is attorney's fees, or settlements.)  They don't need to win to cost you money.

$X - $Y = Motivation.

$X, so far as I can tell, is $0.  There is no reward for a car company that saves lives.  Now, if there is a financial benefit for the company, I'd love to hear what it is.

$Y is hundreds of millions for the first car company to produce a level 3 or 4 SDC.  You cannot expect them to take this on for free.

This is all in line with previous claims, from before they were required to report any incident, that their cars had driven so many miles with no self-driving at-fault accidents.

Bringing media attention to self driving cars involved in accidents makes it seem like they are too blame, even that is not the case.

Planes land on a strip that has no other obstacles, they have enough room to maneuver. And still, the human element is there, ready to take charge if the auto-pilot screws up. And if the auto-pilot screw up, the human element can decide to abort the landing and try again, or can correct the error and proceed with it.


Cars don't have that luxury.


&gt; The manufacturer will be at fault. They will defend their case with copious evidence that they were not at fault.

Have you ever heard about plane crashes? Let's the cases when the pilot is at fault, or when the pilot intentionally crashes the plane. We are left with a huge number of crashes where they have investigations that conclude in manufacturing errors, or computer errors, or engine fatigue/failure, etc.

The manufacturer is clearly at fault in those cases, yet I have never heard of them having to pay.

Same will happen with the cars. Some guy somewhere will make a decision, write it in software, it will kill people, it will be deemed ""acceptable"".


&gt; We prosecute humans all the time for manslaughter with cars. 

Exactly. Can you prosecute a computer? Or in your little delusion, being killed by a computer is far more acceptable than being killed by another driver?

391,lawrensj,"wow, talk about close minded.

so i'm going to break down your arguments 1 by 1 so i don't have to do it again.

&gt; people enjoy owning things. I for one would adore a self-driving car, but I'd hate to rent one from some third-party company

this is called a cab, and using Uber as a definition, you are in the minority.  CERTAINLY in the cities where there is now a majority of the population and that trend has every reason to continue.

&gt;Why should I be beholden to there being a low demand for cars?

because thats how market work.  supply and demand my friend.

&gt; I have medical conditions that require medication; should I run out on a rainy day, I'd in all likelihood call up my rental place and say ""I need a car to get me to the pharmacy"", and they'd say ""due to high demand, we can't get you a car today"". Uh, fucking no, I need this medication.

OR, uber delivers, and an autonomous car will deliver it near instantly.  its a matter of costs not of number of cars.  its called surge pricing for a reason. and because no human will be involved it will be cheaper.

&gt;I absolutely would not sign up for any agency that meant the car that drives me to work might have been scribbled on by some badly-behaved toddler before me.

again see uber.  how it gets implemented is another story.  surge pricing for nicer vehicles seems all but inevitable.

&gt;  . I absolutely would not sign up for any agency that could deny me access to something that I genuinely need as a tool in the modern world, simply because someone else that I've never met has had a particularly busy shopping run.

see you are really rubbing me the wrong way.  you assume that they won't have extra?  you assume they won't plan for peak?  you assume so many wrong things, i am having a hard time keeping the ad homs down.  they will send you a car if you request it.  maybe they intentionally keep stock low so they can increase prices, but competition will beat them, assuming we don't allow a monopoly over the situation, which we probably will.

&gt; I cannot physically drive a standard car because of my medical conditions. Should I be prevented from accessing cars for going to a national park, because I should be punished for not being able to access a ""luxury""?

again someone will be happy to rent you the car you need.  if you think that owning a car for going on select trips to national parks (which i live next to mind you), is cheaper than renting a car for a day here and there, i have a some snake oil to sell you.

&gt; I know that most of the people I know who want self-driving cars would also be up in arms if they weren't available to them for private ownership. 

you have no data, and more than likely given your response, you're in the 35+ category.  i'm going to go with a solid 45.  THAT SAID, i never said we were going to have a choice in the matter.  but hey, keep a hold of your car, until insurance rates spike due to the drop out from the rest of the market due to SDCs.

&gt; I don't WANT to have to rent something that I should have a right to own outright.

and who cares what you want?  the corporations will, for a price, but what makes you so special? unless its large sums of money, you don't really have a say, you are a data point in a sea of data. like i said, it will be a luxary for the rich.  if you can't see how ownership of things is slowly slipping from our hands, largely due to the politics and economics of what i have assumed your generation to be, then you are blind. (edit i hope thats not your medical condition, i apologize if it is)

Because you, like everyone, eventually buy a car too big for what you regularly need. That one time a year when you need to pack in 5 people and luggage requires you to buy a gigantic SUV that burns a ton of gas and spits out a ton of CO2. Then the other 364 days a year, you use that SUV to haul your ass to work, wasting that gas, polluting the environment.

I think the growth will be significantly slower in other areas, particularly if the cost of the technology ends up being high. Vehicles are expensive and infrequently replaced, which I think will somewhat limit their rate of adoption compared to say smart phones or digital cameras. I think we're looking at a transition period of decades. Once the vehicles are released and pricing is established and initial demand can be seen it will be easier to narrow down.

Also it seems that privately owned manually driven vehicles and shared self driving vehicles are the only options you're considering. I think many people in this forum overlook the appeal that privately owned self driving vehicles will have to a fair chunk of the population.

It wasn't their inherent size or age that made them obsolete, it was their lack of vision. I just don't agree that the car companies lack the vision to see SDC coming.

&gt; Morgan Stanley&amp;#039;s research shows that cars are driven just 4% of the year, which is an astonishing waste considering that the average cost of car ownership is nearly $9,000 per year.

&gt; A full 60% of US adults surveyed stated that they would ride in an autonomous car, and nearly 32% said they would not continue to drive once an autonomous car was available instead. But no one is more excited than Uber-CEO Travis Kalanick recently stated that Uber will eventually replace all of its drivers with self-driving cars.

&gt; As most autonomous cars are likely to be electric, we would eliminate most of the 134 billion gallons of gasoline used each year in the US alone.

About 1.3M people die each year in traffic accidents. In the US it's about 30,000 people a year.

Is self-driving cars can cut that number in **half**, then you've accomplished a great thing. If self-driving cars can save 15,000 lives annually in the United States, and 610,000 around the world, you should take that benefit without hesitation.

At the same time it means:

**15,000 people will die each year in self-driving car accidents.**

The public, and regulators, will **have** to accept 15,000 people dying in self-driving car accidents. If they don't, they will have to accept 30,000 people dying in human-driving car accidents.

I realize people result readily accept higher risk when they have the illusion of control, and fear safe situations when they don't have control. E.g. people will gladly drive in a car every day (with a 1 in 30,000 chance of dying), but lose their minds when one person in 300,000,000 had Ebola.

413,PaulGodsmark,"This is a well thought out and logical argument, but for the fact that increasing automation makes drivers more error prone. So the author is offering the situation where the vehicle is mostly automated (NHTSA Level 3) but needs a human when things get complex.

Firstly that means the human will become de-skilled and need to take over in the most complex situations that require the greatest skill.

Secondly, almost the entire benefits of autonomous vehicles are lost because the driver has to remain in the loop. So private ownership of vehicles continues - average vehicle occupancy of 1.2 continues. Vehicles being left idle 95% of the time continues and occupying valuable real estate whilst parked.

But something surprising happened: ""Even though people had sworn up and down 'I'm going to pay so much attention,'"" and there were cameras watching them too, ""people do really stupid stuff when they're driving."" Basically, ""the assumption that humans could be a reliable back-up for the system was a total fallacy!"" Teller said.

That's the entire reason I want SDCs in the first place is so I don't have to be in control.

(AP) — The latest version of Google's self-driving car — a pod-like two-seater that needs no gas pedal or steering wheel — will make its debut on public roads this summer, a significant step in the technology giant's mission to have driverless cars available to consumers in the next five years.

This prototype is the first vehicle built from scratch for the purpose of self-driving, Google says. It looks like a Smart car with a shiny black bowler hat to hide its sensors, and it can drive, brake and recognize road hazards without human intervention. It has more capabilities than the prototype Google introduced last May, which was so rudimentary it had fake headlights.

The new pod isn't designed for a long trip, or a joyride. It lacks air bags and other federally required safety features, so it can't go more than 25 miles per hour. It's electric, and has to be recharged after 80 miles. And the pod can only drive in areas that have been thoroughly mapped by Google.

At first, it will likely even have a steering wheel and gas pedal — current California regulations require them. Those regulations also require a driver to be able to take back control of the car at any time. But Google is lobbying for more flexible regulations.

Google will initially build and test 25 pods, mostly in neighborhoods surrounding its Mountain View headquarters. It will eventually build between 50 and 100, and will broaden testing to sites that are hillier and rainier.

The ultimate goal, says Google co-founder Sergey Brin, is computer-controlled cars that can eliminate human error, which is a factor in an estimated 90 percent of the 1.2 million road deaths that occur worldwide each year. Self-driving cars could also improve traffic congestion and transport the elderly and disabled.

Google shocked the auto industry in 2010 with its announcement that it was working on a driverless car. Brin insists Google doesn't aspire to be a car company, but wants its technology to be adopted by automakers.

""We want to partner to bring self-driving to all the vehicles in the world,"" Brin told a group of journalists and community members gathered earlier this week to take rides in the prototype.

For now the traditional automakers are pursuing their own self-driving technology, but with less ambitious timeline of 10 to 15 years for a truly driverless car.

Chris Urmson, who directs Google's self-driving car project, says the slow-moving, friendly looking prototype — his young son thinks it looks like a koala because of the nose-like black laser on the front — is a good bridge between the company's current test fleet of 20 specially outfitted Lexus SUVs and the more advanced, higher-speed driverless cars of its future, which might not even look like anything on the road today.

""This vehicle is really all about us learning. This vehicle could go on a freeway, but when we think about introducing the technology, we want to do that very thoughtfully and very safely,"" Urmson says.

Convincing drivers that driverless technology is safe is one of the hurdles the company must overcome. Earlier this week, in response to questions from The Associated Press, Google acknowledged 11 minor accidents in the six years it has been testing autonomous cars. Urmson says the company is proud of that record, and notes that Google's vehicles have completed more than 1.7 million miles of testing. He says all but one of the accidents were caused by drivers in other cars; in the only incident caused by a Google car, a staffer was driving in manual mode.

Consumers question whether they can trust self-driving cars to work all the time, who will be liable if there's an accident and how self-driving cars will interact with regular cars, says the consulting firm J.D. Power and Associates. In a 2013 survey of U.S. drivers, J.D. Power found only one in five was interested in a fully autonomous car.

Urmson says Google needs to do a better job of educating people about self-driving technology and updating them on Google's progress. It's building a Web site to teach people about the technology, and the site will feature a monthly report that will include details of any accidents involving Google cars. The site will also have a section where people can send feedback when they interact with the cars.

The prototype cars — assembled in suburban Detroit by Roush Industries — have the same array of radars, lasers and cameras as Google's fleet of Lexus SUVs, which allows them to share data. If one car's camera spots orange cones and construction signs, for example, it will alert all the others to slow down in that area or reroute around a lane closure.

Dmitri Dolgov, the head of software for the self-driving car project, says Google's software has gotten much better over the last year at classifying objects, like trees and mailboxes, and predicting behavior of pedestrians and other cars. For example, Google's cars will slow down if they sense that a car in the next lane is speeding up to cut in front of them. And in one recent test, a Google car paused when a cyclist ran a red light. Another car, driven by a human, went ahead and nearly hit the cyclist.

The system isn't perfect. On a test drive, one of Google's Lexus SUVs seemed momentarily confused when a mail truck partially blocked its path. Later, during a demonstration drive in Google's parking lot, the prototype — without a wheel or pedal — braked when it spotted a row of folding chairs. It had to figure out that the chairs wouldn't move before it proceeded.
",1431709294,cra63wi,t3_362ty6,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2015
418,michelework,"
Dolgov says it's impossible to predict everything its test cars might see, so they're programmed to act in the most conservative way when they confront something unusual, like the time a Google SUV stopped and waited while a woman in a wheelchair chased a duck with a broom.

Google isn't alone in developing self-driving cars. Mercedes-Benz, Infiniti and other brands already have advanced driver assistance systems, like lane keeping and adaptive cruise control, that can pilot the car on the highway with minimal input from the driver. Unlike Google, automakers think self-driving cars will arrive feature-by-feature instead of all at once, giving people plenty of time to adapt to autonomous driving.

But Urmson says that approach is ""fundamentally wrong.""

""We believe that's like saying, 'If I work really hard at jumping, one day I'll just be able to fly,'"" he said.

Egil Juliussen, the principal analyst of infotainment and advanced driver assist systems for the consulting firm IHS Automotive, says Google's ""moon shot"" strategy is difficult and riskier than just adding features to existing cars. But he thinks it could ultimately be successful. Google could make self-driving urban pods for universities or urban centers, for example, or sell its technology to automakers.

Brin says the company is still refining its plans for self-driving cars, but he's excited about their potential.

""Our goal is to create something safer than human drivers,"" he said.

States have been falling over themselves to explicitly legalize the technology, with only minimal constraints on developers. The public hasn't yet been convinced of the superior safety of AVs, nor should they as AVs *have yet to be proven as safer than human drivers.* For example:

&gt;For most new technologies, it’s not the data people are interested in, but the anecdotes. In 1.7 million miles logged by Google’s self-driving cars, the company reports only 11 collisions, all of which were minor and all of which were the fault of a human driver. But the fact that a computer was involved in steering one of the vehicles will scare people away from the technology, despite all logic.

The public and regulators are very interested in the data. The problem is, there's very little available. Google's crash rate is similar to the typical driver. His main argument seems to be that because Google claims they were never at fault, then they must have been safer. First, we are taking their word about fault. Second, the ""fault"" is less important to me than overall crash rate. If Google is at-fault in one crash over a million miles, that's safe compared to the typical. But if they crash 20 times in a million miles yet were never at fault, that's either incredibly unlucky, or more likely the vehicle is doing something that invites these crashes. Either way, don't talk about how people are illogical and are only interested in anecdotes when all we have are anecdotes and the data is far from convincing.

&gt;But most [analyses](http://mctdirect.com/preview.php?id=201504212013MCT_____REG_NEWS15408106_0) indicate that computers are nearly always better than human drivers where safety is concerned, and they’re only getting better.

That's a horrible source.

The author goes on to list things that were considered bad at one point, but that no one seems to mind or care about today, implying that AVs will follow a similar path.

&gt; - War and violence are readily accepted as a fact of life by most Americans, and if people were rational, everyone would drop what they’re doing to stop nonstop violence happening around the world.

&gt; - The National Security Agency’s comprehensive multi-billion-dollar spying efforts are less overt these days, so what’s to worry about?
&gt; - Where today are all the people who once opposed plastics and equal rights for minorities?

We protest against war and violence, all the time. The NSA is getting hammered in courts. And what were the recent police protests about if not equal rights for minorities? Finally, the author fails to acknowledge counter examples where a technology has a clear benefits yet societal fears have delayed deployment, e.g. nuclear power.

&gt; According to the American Trucker Association, there are 3.5 million professional truck drivers in the US, and an additional 5.2 million people employed within the truck-driving industry who don&amp;#039;t drive the trucks.

&gt; They&amp;#039;re just the first ones to throw them into a truck and allow truckers to sit back and enjoy the ride, while the truck itself does all the driving.

&gt; Wirelessly linked truck platoons are as simple as having a human driver drive a truck, with multiple trucks without drivers following closely behind.

429,qurun,"&gt; **Total distance travelled** increases under all of the scenarios we studied. Overall car kilometres travelled over the course of the day rose 6% in the TaxiBot system with high-capacity public transport and **nearly doubled (+89%)** in the AutoVot scenario with no public transport.

&gt; Similarly to all-day travel, **car-kilometres travelled at peak hours** increase compared to the base case in all scenarios considered (Table 6). For the TaxiBot scenario with high-capacity public transport, this increase is relatively low (9%). For the AutoVot scenario without high capacity public transport, the **increase is significant (103%)**. While the former increase remains manageable, the latter would definitely not be.

&gt;  In this scenario, **road occupancy increases by 40 to 50% for all road classes**, with the strongest growth occurring on local road networks. This implies poorer performance and possibly congestion. It may also mean a change in the nature of local street traffic resulting from the presence of additional traffic on what were otherwise quieter, less-used roads. Such an increase in traffic could have a negative impact on the attractiveness and livability of local streets, as it reduces their availability for non-transport use.

&gt; These results suggest that shared self-driving fleets may face some transition issues due to the presence of legacy fleets. Unless increases in travel at peak hours are managed, **it may be difficult to make a public policy case for self-driving fleets based solely on freed space and congestion benefits in the presence of legacy conventional cars.** 

&gt;  These findings suggest that shared and self-driving fleets operating in parallel with private conventional car fleets may lead to **even higher parking requirements than today** in the absence of bus services.  

Note that they are also assuming that people will tolerate up to an extra 15-20 minutes travel duration for each trip (5-10 minutes wait time plus 20% extra travel time up to a 10 minute maximum).

But consider that 10,000 miles a year at 40 MPH average is 250 hours or 10.4 full days that I am engaged in driving and unable to do any other productive activity (safely). Let's say my time is worth $20 per hour and a robocab travels at 40 MPH on average. I could add 8 cents for 67 cents per mile.

Even though I purchased an inexpensive car and maintained it well, I can't think of a single cost category of mine that can't be trounced by fleet ownership of cars. The only expense a robocab company would have that I don't is R&amp;D and supply of sensors, computers and actuators that make a car self-driving.

EDIT - just realized that a robocab company would also have the expense of re-positioning an empty car to its next pickup. Not sure what the magnitude of this expense would be, but it potentially eliminates any parking fees. Guess it is dependent on how well coordinated the fleet is.

2ND EDIT - if I sell my car today I should be able to get $5,000 for it. My price point should be 54 cents a mile or 62 adjusted for my time value.",1431973797,crd6ggz,t1_crc0ufh,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2015

The big issue is drag at higher speeds, and all the engine optimization in the world isn't going to affect that. You can make cars more aerodynamic, but that creates two issues: Many optimizations sacrifice customer comfort undesirable in general use vehicles; and more specifically you need to create significant downforce to keep cars on the road at higher speeds. An F1 race car has a higher drag coefficient than a Hummer H1. 

And I just saw your tl;dr so maybe the above is irrelevant, but I'll leave it. I will say that one area self driving cars can help with drag is by platooning, but at this point I would hesitate to predict how much. ",1432156023,crfn92m,t1_crfmevl,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2015
461,thang1thang2,"&gt; I will say that one area self driving cars can help with drag is by platooning, but at this point I would hesitate to predict how much. 

It's an interesting concept, but I don't see it affecting much because nobody is going to care unless it's in deep urban areas where you can rely on it over 50% of the time. It also has the interesting effect of making someone ""pay"" for being at the front of the line. There would have to be some sort of system to sort out who's in the current ranking of a platoon to make sure everyone spends a certain amount of time breaking the wind and at that point why bother worrying about it or calculating it into energy prices at all? It'd just be easier to go off of non platoon numbers all of the time and see any potential savings as a free gift.

&gt; The big issue is drag at higher speeds, and all the engine optimization in the world isn't going to affect that.

That was basically what I realized in the math past my tl;dr. I should've put that up above as well. Even with the math with electric cars that I did (assuming they're perfectly linear engine wise at high speeds) it's still a ridiculous amount of energy you pay for ""only"" 3.333x the speed.

Basically 200 mph is 3.333x faster than 60mph and a tesla gets around a 300 mile range with ""normal driving"" (we'll say 60mph for ease), so 300/3.333 is 90 miles, but you'll only get around 56 miles of range going 200 mph with the math I did. Your range is almost halved, just from air drag alone (since electric cars are close enough to linear output to count).

Gas engines will fare even worse as we see with a car going from ~25 mpg at 60 mph to ~3.5 mpg at 168mph. A 2.8x speed increase, but 7x gas usage increase. Electric is a hell of a lot better with ""2x gas usage"" increase, but the range currently won't justify it at all. Of course, at 3.5 mph the porche is only doing a 42 mile range, so I guess you can say electric cars are already superior in that respect...",1432156906,crfnsqh,t1_crfn92m,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2015

It doesn't solve the real issue just a very specific example people bring up as a problem.  And TBH, passing other cars is not the real issue here.

When the car is designed to do something like stay in the lane and not rear end the car in front of you, who is at fault when the program fails?  When the car for whatever reason, loses sight of the lane markers and cries for driver help too late?

Right now it's the driver.  He takes the blame.  Which is fine with normal cruise control.  But when steering is added to the automatic functions, driver are going get complacent.  They are going to give over too much to the car.  Then when the car alerts them something isn't working (hopefully) as well as intended, the driver will not have any situational awareness.  He will not know how to react in an emergency because he doesn't know what is nearby, or where the empty space is around him to swerve too.  A driver suddenly being put on the spot to take in all their surroundings, judge the emergency and then react is going to take 3-5 seconds for anything other than just slamming on the brakes (maybe making things worse seeing as you have no idea about the world around you).  At 80 mph, that is a long time.

Google has already shown that after the initial phase or getting used to an auto-driving car, people give over TOO much trust to them.  They completely tune out to the world outside their car because it becomes irrelevant.  Humans are easily distracted *without* any automatic functions on the car.  This will only become more or a problem as self-driving cars become more and more common.

-   You would also expect the cars to be able to self diagnosis even far better than today.   They will have enormous data to mine and figure out what is wrong with a lot of accuracy.

473,naturalredditor,"There is one thing that hasn't really been discussed and that is the ability to maintain a self driving vehicle. As part of a fleet where an operator uses one vehicle type or so, when a vehicle needs to be taken in for checks or to be fixed, etc, the user does not suffer. A vehicle can be taken off the road just like that. The engineers and mechanics, etc, benefit from economies of scale and one or two exact designs. They know the exact inner workings and time spent on the vehicle is minimal. They can swap out parts with ease. 

For personal ownership, for legal reasons manufacturers and the autonomous tech developers will not want average Joe or average Joe mechanic tampering with the vehicle. Even if the damage is completely independent of the autonomous systems, it will likely be recalled. The problem here is to where. You either have a group of mechanics and engineers repairing one or two vehicle types or a whole host. If they are specific to the vehicle then your vehicle will be out of action for some time. There is no way that say Tesla as an example will have a repair shop in Ten thousand locations across the US. With more mechanics and engineers at each location than they know what to do with. With an abundance of parts and resources at each location. The vehicle will be sent to a more regional and centralized 'shop'. 

In the mean time you need transportation. So we get people having to use a back up vehicle or heaven forbid a shared fleet vehicle. I don't think a manufacturer would be stupid enough to allow that to happen. You are just asking for your customers to ditch you for the shared fleet model by doing that. You will be sent a replacement vehicle or even go without. Is this replacement vehicle even autonomous? Meanwhile your car is spending a long time being repaired and this centralized 'shop'. 

In comparison you have a shared fleet of 1000 vehicles. If 100 are out of action there is simply 10% less vehicles in operation. It doesn't have much of an impact on you the customer at all. The vehicles will be repaired/maintained within the vicinity. You simply get on with your life.

Where as for a personal car owner, they may have to send their vehicle off to somewhere countless miles away. In many cases it can't get there on it's own or with you driving. It has to be collected. It also has to come back to you. The 100 vehicles have to be replaced with 100 vehicles in the meantime. The whole process is incredibly inefficient compared to the fleet model. 

To be blunt, maintaining dozens of types of personal autonomous vehicles is going to be an absolute ball ache. I don't think anyone has comprehended just how much of a ball ache it will be. Even with vast improvements to the sector, such as the ability to additive manufacture parts or for the vehicle to run self diagnostics, etc, because it is smart. It is going to be a huge ball ache taking apart a vehicle carefully and accurately. There was a video posted the other day showing how it took 1400 man hours just to retrofit a vehicle to be autonomous. At $40 an hour that is $56,000 in man hours alone. 

I think it is going to be very expensive to conduct repairs on an autonomous vehicle. As part of a shared fleet the decision is simple and easy. You just scrap the vehicle and use a new one. But for a personal car owner, what do you do? Does you or your insurer spend the multiple thousands on repairs and countless man hours or do you get a new vehicle?

Well, at least repairing anything involving the autonomous systems--many repairs will go exactly as they go now.

If anything it will become easier to repair a self driving vehicle. If the vehicle is still mobile it can drive itself to the repair shop while you're at work.

An autonomous fleet trip would obviously cost a fraction of that. 

Less frequent repairs, more convenient, and cheaper alternate transportation. It doesn't seem like an issue to me.

As I told someone else, I live in SF with no car. The sacramento county fair is this weekend, and it's two hours away (120 miles, probably). Totally doable if I had a car. I could do it on a tank of gas.

An uber each way would be hundreds. I'd say over 400 bucks.

So in my mind, the question is: **Is it worth a 400 bucks to go to the fair this weekend?**  

The answer is pretty much no even though it technically is still significantly cheaper than owning a car.  

But if I owned a car the answer is a no brainer. I'd be going to the fair.

479,ihahp,"&gt;No you don't. Most people are completely oblivious to the rate of depreciation of their vehicle. 

Exactly. What they're aware of is their monthly payment and insurance every few months. That's it. So it feels pretty much like an all-you-can-drive fee. Yes, gas is extra. But gas feels ""free"" for errands around town, and is significantly less expensive for a day trip than renting a car is. 

my point of **ubering to the fair is cost prohibitive, using a car that I already own is not**, perceptually. Regardless of the real numbers. It's a perception thing. 

&gt;stop using today's figures for a cab ride in which the human element (driver) accounts for over 50% the cost of your ride directly and indirectly.

I used the only known metric we have at the moment, but in my original post I commented that I hope they can get the price down, or people will still want to own, in order to do trips like this.  

&gt;Do yourself a favor 

What's your problem? Do you have some sort of agenda? Go back and read my original post. Some people think we won't own self driving cars, and I questioned that, and I cited some perception. And yes, I used present day prices, but I also said in my original post that I hope self-driving cars have all-you-can-drive price plans. 

Why does my opinion bother you so much?  why do you think self-driving-cars just *have to be rented, instead of owned*, and my posts make you tell say shit like ""do yourself a favor""?

But my long standing prediction is that once all cars are self driving that they can lose most of their safety gear which makes up a huge portion of the weight of a car. Thus electric cars become much more reasonable as 200+ HP isn't needed along with anywhere near the energy storage.

Thus as batteries get cheaper and the massive drop in car weights and sizes that electric will absolutely be the future.

But everyone here in SDCs have been making lists of those who lose their jobs due to SDCs and that list is just getting longer and longer. Beyond the obvious such as taxi drivers and the second level of obvious like insurance companies, there will be a very large but almost entirely forgotten group such as physiotherapy people who treat people damaged in accidents or companies that make that powered stuff sprinkled on accidents to mop up the oils. It's not that those businesses will go away, just that there will be a sizeable drop in revenue. The key being that there are a zillion little businesses that either exist because of accidents or have a notable part of their revenue derived from them.

It will also be interesting to see how many businesses turned out to depend on bored drivers as opposed to bored passengers. As a bored driver needs some distraction but not too much. So sipping on a large drink while listening to talk radio is about as much as is safe. A lone bored passenger of a SDC can play video games, sleep, eat full course meals, watch movies, read books, etc.

Thus I can see something like the drive thru just dying or morphing into something entirely different.

So there are two predictions: The drive-through selling the simple meal will go away and drive time talk radio will die. 

Also the era of the insano in car entertainment system is about to begin. Basically car as livingroom.

&gt; A truly useable self-driving car is going to have to be part of a complex ecosystem of technologies: hardware, software, automated services, and real-world support. Though companies like Volvo will be doing a good job making sure that occupants are safe while they're driving, Google has a huge lead in making sure that you'll be able to tell your car where to go and it will actually get there. Developing an operating system for self-driving cars that integrates the hardware, software, and networked services will be a huge task, and any car company that goes it alone will probably botch it. Lastly, once cars are advanced enough that they're able to ply the streets unoccupied, or with occupants who can't drive, such as children, there will still be thousands of circumstances every day where human beings will have to step in and make manual adjustments or judgement calls. Just as you can call for roadside assistance with a dead battery or flat tire today, cars of the future may have to call for a human being to help it understand whether the obstacle in its way is a boulder or a plastic bag, or why it's lost traction, or what to do when it's maneuvered into a driveway that now has a gate that won't open.

Nobody is going to be taking your steering wheel from you any time soon. If you're comfortable endangering your own safety and that of others you'll have that option for decades. Even then you'll still be made safer by *other* people using self driving vehicles. Personally I can't wait to be able to do other things while I'm driving.

28,deck_hand,"I don't see why a ""fly by wire"" control system wouldn't work very well with these spherical tires.  I can think of several control systems that could be used as human input into the steering mechanisms to allow people to ""drive"" the vehicles, while maintaining very precise control over the system.

I've used a ""space ball"" 3d controller that allows one to control a ""virtual flying camera"" in three dimensions.   A less complex controller would work as well with a car like this in 2 dimensions.  I could envision a normal steering wheel that would allow yaw control, while foot pedals allow for thrust control, while a side-mounted joystick could be used for ""slew control"" for sliding into a parking space.

It would be trivial to include ""anti-collision"" systems on the car to avoid running into things, where the anti-collision logic within the directional control systems in the car push back on the force-feedback controllers to help the human driver avoid hitting things.  The car could refuse to drive into objects, even if the human driver attempts to force it to do so.

This would be a melding, somewhere between ""self-drive"" and ""manual drive"" that would feel like a manually driven car to the operator, but would retain all of the crash-avoidance advantages of a self-driving car.

We wont actually need to own a car outright, but subscribe to a car sharing service. The maximum peak will occur at morning and evening commute hours. That will determine the number of cars in the fleet. 

A shared fleet also allows a variety of car options. Instead of owning the largest size car you think you might sometimes use, the car you utiliyze will be appropriatley sized for length and speed of journey, passenger count and type of journey. 

This is where the greatest efficiency is gained.

* Going to Ikea or similar big box store for shopping? A self driving pick up or small box van is delivered.
 
* Going out to dinner with your spouse to celebrate an anniversary?  Send a posh two seater. 
 

We will see a fraction of the cars on the road today. Most people utilize their car maybe 10 percent of the time, if that. 
Imagine how many cars just sit parked along your streets. Now imagine them all gone. Look at all the space allocated for parking idle vehicles. All that can be re purposed in a more meaningful way. 

Since your commute patterns are already known by Google via your smartphone in your pocket, Google can already strategically place the right number of cars in the right location to ensure that a car is always a minute away.

40,solidh2o,"A few thoughts:

1) While I look forward to an uber-like service replacing my car, I see myself having a self driving car for probably 5-10 years before whatever infrastructure is needed proves itself and is put in place.  In this time you'll still see a traffic decrease because the rubber banding effect ( in theory) should be mostly eliminated from rush hour, shortening commutes. 

2) I could very easily see a sort of mass transit system that looks like a subway, but requires no track, running in circles.  You get in a car form your house ( that's on a gps limitation to outside the city to get commuters), then get off when you get to a hub, ride the hub to the nearest point to your office and then get on another small car, or walk to your office from there. I don't think any simulation has been run, but you might be able to limit routes and run circles for various cars and minimize travel times for everyone while maximizing car efficiency.

3) VR is probably going to coincide w/ the self driving car changes, it could lead to a lot more people working from home.

4) If you (like me) think that technological unemployment is around the corner, commuting might be decreasing in 10 years anyway.

This will all boil down to when I primarily use a car (rush hour or not) and how often I use a car. Various studies have pegged various costs to owning a car. 8000 per year is one number bandied about. I think that an infrequently used cheaper car could be gotten down to 3000 per year. Maybe lower if self driving cars are small and insurance is cheap. So the cost will be 10-20 dollars per day.

Assuming that self driving taxis are much cheaper and people use roughly that amount or less then it will be whichever is more convenient that will win.

Personally I love the idea of driving downtown and just stepping out of the car and not worrying about where it goes next. Or having the capacity for my whole family to be in all different directions at once. 

Even things like camping trips would be cool where the car drops me off at one place. Then 8 days later I call a taxi and it picks me up somewhere totally different; where I didn't worry about what it did for those 8 days.

Those technologies were developed and became common. They were amazing, changed our lives in a great many ways, some of which we couldn't have dreamed of before we had them. It's well within our technological capacity to be paper free now. Yet, last I heard, we were printing more than ever. Go figure. 

There is a cautionary tale there. We have a tendency to believe that just because something will become possible, and it sounds high tech and cool, that it will become so. We completely buy into predictions for ""10 years from now"" while forgetting that so many predictions from 10 years ago haven't panned out the way we thought they would. 

When I challenge some of the predictions offered with such certitude I think some view me as a luddite. I'm in no way challenging that self driving cars are coming (although perhaps not as quickly as some will hope). In fact I think they will be one of the most momentous and transformative developments in the history of the world. There will be amazing benefits, many of which we will predict and a good number nobody can even imagine now. 

All I claim is that some of the predictions will not turn out to be practical for a variety of reasons, and some that are will still not be adopted because humans are not always rational nor practical. Also, with every significant change, no matter how incredible overall, comes new problems and challenges. These are lessons I and countless others have learned the hard way; lessons many people obviously still haven't learned.

&gt; If you read the papers, you'll see the technology is coming in maybe three years or 30 years. I'm here to tell you, it's a bit of both. The first is the idea that this technology is going to come out incrementally and when it does come out, we're going to want it to be better than human drivers.""

There is a lot of information there. The first conclusion is that the ultimate level 4 experience (from Google) is a long way off, as that would be on the far end of the ""3 years to 30 years"" range.

You can then make another conclusion that Google will be putting out product well before the ultimate level 4 experience, on the lower end of the ""3 years to 30 years"" range. This would be what I call ""restricted-use-case level 4"".

This could mean level 4 only on freeways, which Tesla could be getting close to. There would be lots of interest in this.

Another possibility is a car that will only drive within a restricted route with various weather/light restrictions. There are plenty of applications for this, but they probably wouldn't be of great interest to the general public as personal vehicles.

So when you call for a taxi (via app), the system will figure out whether a self driving car can take you from the pickup point to the destination, and that will determine what kind of car arrives.

Google will be forced to do this because others will be doing it.",1457770680,d0wzu1k,t3_4a1ukz,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2016
59,[deleted],"This whole modern evolution of the self driving car begin on the kind of roads you describe in the DARPA Grand Challenge 10 years ago. Self Driving cars are not like Scalextric. They don't have to stick to an exact pre-defined route. 

Autonomous vehicle suites are superior to humans at sensing their surroundings. They have quicker reaction times. The likes of DeepMind are superior to humans at path projection. Computer vision is on the cusp of outperforming humans. 

Some of the problems you describe have yet to be thoroughly solved. I come across them often in the UK. Most people using this sub would have a panic attack using a narrow country road. It isn't simple for self driving cars. They either need to be programmed to or most likely will have to learn (think DeepMind) how to navigate such situations. Because often the solution becomes an off road scenario. That testing could be taking place on private property. Google have shown video clips of a couple that have occurred on Californian roads. But the main reason they want to test their vehicles on the Isle of Man is to solve this problem. 

What is important to understand is how these vehicles will be rolled out. For Google it will come in 3 stages of full automation. Mapped zones for fleet vehicles in optimum weather conditions. The vehicles simply won't operate on any road that the project team deem to be a problem. Think Urban LA. 

Stage 2 is the same but in less than optimum weather conditions. So places with heavy rain, snow, fog, mist, etc. Think Ann Arbor, Michigan or Washington Seattle.

The analogy would be if I was on a plan that lets me travel a certain distance for $10/month. If I go to my local small vegetable shop, who are too small and new to the business to be able to pay anything to car service providers, the car drives at its 'normal' slow speed (shaped by the car company based on my plan). If I go to the big brand supermarket, even though it is a bit further, the supermarket has made a deal with my car company, so I get there a lot faster - and it doesn't count against my monthly quota.

I suspect that if the market does become consolidated to a few players, this sort of deal will come into existence (big hotels already have free airport transfer shuttles). However, there is hopefully less potential for an oligopoly with self-driving transport than there is with Internet, because cars are inherently mobile. The risks may be more around control of parking, and also vertical integration (if there is not an economy of smaller companies making parts for a self-driving car, or at least selling assembled self-driving cars, and only big companies that handle the entire supply chain to make and rent out self-driving cars, the barrier of entry to the market could be even bigger than broadband).

82,PaulGodsmark,"&gt;It's relatively easy for hackers to take control of the GPS navigation systems of self-driving cars, Cummings said.

I am not clear why this is such a big problem for a system like the one that Google and GM appear to be following. They rely on detailed maps stored on-board for precise navigation (SLAM) and only use the GPS for overall route navigation and route optimisation. That is - the GPS helps them to choose the best road to be on for a route plan, but is not a safety critical system.

So if the GPS general location fails or is spoofed and doesn't agree with the precise mapping location then the system will recognise this and, I speculate, can either complete the journey using on-board mapping, or advise the control centre of a discrepancy and finds a safe place to stop whilst the issue is resolved.

85,PaulGodsmark,"&gt;**At Baidu, we plan to put commercial, self-driving cars on the roads by 2018.** But the way to make them safe is not to make them act just like human driven cars—in fact, the limitations of today’s technology mean that’s not feasible. Instead, we should make modest changes to our infrastructure, program these cars to behave as predictably as possible, and teach the public new ways to interact with them.

In a [previous online post](https://www.quora.com/When-will-self-driving-cars-be-available-to-consumers?redirected_qid=66704500) Andrew Ng gave a more detailed view of what that 2018 date might mean:

&gt;First, I think the approach of building a car that can drive everywhere is very challenging, and is the wrong first goal to aim for. Autonomous driving's biggest problem is addressing all the corner cases--all the strange things that happen once per 10,000 or 100,000 miles of driving. Machine learning is good at getting your performance from 90% accuracy to maybe 99.9%, but it's never been good at getting us from 99.9% to 99.9999%. **I think it is more promising to start with a different goal: A shuttle/bus that can only drive one bus route or just in a small region.** If we can make sure that route's road surface and lane markings are well maintained, that there's no construction, etc. then we're within striking distance of making that truly safe. This then lets us slowly add routes and gradually grow the regions in which we can drive safety.

Also autonomous cars--privately owned or shared--may increase the amount people want to and are willing to drive, especially if prices also fall.

114,CallMeOatmeal,"&gt;The tech is evolving fast. We'll definately be able to make reliable SDCs by 2020 or a couple years after.

It's evolving at a relatively constant pace. Don't forget, ""modern"" self driving research has been going on since the mid-1980's with Carnagie Mellon's Navlab and the Eureka Prometheus Project. The grand challenges in the 2000's were another major milestone, with most participants utilizing Veldyne's lidar unit. And then of course Google's purchase of 510 systems in 2011, and the evolution of deep learning have been other points where we saw a big bump in capability. It's easy to look at Google doing 1.5 million autonomous miles and say ""we're almost there"", but you need to consider the conditions of these 1.5 million miles, and how many times the human needs to take over (see Google's disengagement report). The long tail of full level 4 autonomy is a difficult nut to crack. We'll get there eventually. I just don't think it'll be 4 years. I'll buy 10 though. 


&gt; Legislation is going to be the big hindrance.

I actually disagree with this one (at least int he U.S.). I think the NHTSA under Anthony Foxx's leadership is showing great foresight and planning, and while some states (like CA) have passed some legislation that seems to stifle innovation, there are 49 other states, and many of them are surprisingly open to self driving cars. 


&gt;We're 5 years away from the technology, but we may be 50 from legislation that makes it practical. There's no way to know with lobbying.

At least in computers, automated tests are standardized (they need to be able to be run as something approaching a gold standard) and continuously updated as features change and issues are identified.

Ideally, the test suite would be comprehensive, testing a slowly increasing range of circumstances (from curves to broken traffic lights, from submerged roadbed to oncoming traffic) in a slowly increasing range of conditions (e.g. day, night, sun-in-eyes, day-fog, night-fog, light rain, heavy rain, night rain, faraday cage, gusting wind). You might be assured that your car would face all of the circumstances under all of the conditions, but the order would be randomized.

Defining standards also allows us to define what tests to apply to each kind of vehicle, since a self-driving downtown taxi with a top speed of 25mph has different criteria than a multi-role cruiser which needs to handle downtown and freeway traffic, and that potentially has a different set of criteria than a self-driving road-train.",1458592501,d18ah6d,t1_d188cea,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2016

&gt;  So our cars are going to try hardest to avoid hitting unprotected road users, cyclists and pedestrians.Then after that they're going to try hard to avoid moving things. Then after that, they're going to avoid things that don't move in the world. And we'll be up front about that, and you can make the choice that given the incredibly slim probability that you'll ever be in one of these situations, are you OK with that. And then you can use it or not. And that reduces that ethical dilemma down to something that's actually tractable and solvable and implementable.

This allows people like her to guide science grants away from super geniuses and to people like her who are capable of ""leading"" a team. Then she might let some of her money go to the super genius so that it makes her look great. 

The second is that she stated that she wants a ""clear certification process"". On the surface this sounds great. Except certified to do exactly what? This is all so new that nobody really knows where any of this is going. This would be like having a bridge certification process when we don't fully know what a river is.

Sorry Twitter 140 characters will cause people to skip punctuation to fit in their thoughts. Sorry snapchat, people do want to store their photos.

At this point I can describe a certification process seeing that there won't be 9,000 companies all trying to get approved. A state (It can't initially be federal as this needs competition between states) engineer will drive with a car to see if it even vaguely appears to be road worthy. Then it will be approved for testing on the roads as long as the car has some kind of driver and emergency override that will at least bring it to a halt and preferably on the side of the road. 

Then after many miles of zero drama driving the engineer will look it over one more time and then either give it a thumbs up or down.

I suspect that what she is talking about will take 10's of thousands of man hours, many many trips to Washington (and zero to California) will have a panel of ""experts"" who are paid very well and have huge expense accounts for attending conferences all over the world and far away from any actual self driving cars, and when they are done the ""clear certification process"" will run many thousands of pages, will have contradictory and vague requirements that allow them to shut down any project they want, and most importantly gives her power and money without having to do any science or actually solve any problems.

The cool part is that people's phones could also be looped in. So a car that has enough time to make it would stop and pick a few people up. Plus in an all self driving car world, there would be no panicked bottlenecks; things like opposing traffic lanes would just all become outbound lanes.

Even cars that encountered things such as ruined bridges or trees in the road could be quickly routed around the problem with subsiquent cars not even being routed that way. Also emergency services could respond to the worst of the worst. If the most important escape route were cut off by something like a tree they could be sent there to remove it.

Also multiple options could be put into play depending upon the speed at which the disaster was coming. If the wave was going faster than the cars could get to the best spot, then a not so great but best spot could be the backup plan.

For instance in my old city I could drive for about 15 minutes and would be high enough for all but a disaster movie level Tsunami. But 8 minutes away was a huge fortification on a hill. Highest point by quite a bit short of the 15 minute drive.

Another key would be for people to be able to report that they were encountering something dramatic. So a bridge being out, a watermain break, etc would be rapidly sent out to incoming cars. Thus as part of a 911 call there would be the option for the dispatcher to block off an area or evacuate an area.

150,skgoa,"I can't tell you who I work for or what I do exactly, other than that I'm an automotive software engineer. I.e. I work on software for electronic and mechatronic systems that typically up in cars or other vehicles. With a few notable exceptions^1 the automotive industry *is* the ""self-driving car industry"". They/we are the ones who build cars and the components/systems they assembled from. All big OEMs^2 and suppliers are working on automation. Tens of Billions are being spend, hundreds of thousands of people are working on automation-related projects all over the world. This is includes sensors (RADAR, LIDAR, FLIR, cameras etc.), actuators (electronic steering etc.) and everything in-between. 

&gt; So if you do, how did you get in or what background do you have?

I studied computer science at a pretty prestigious university in Germany. I worked to afford my living expenses and thus had considerable work experience for a student. A year before graduation I applied for a student position at my current employer and got hired for a) my programming experience and b) knowing how to deal with certain technologies that are common in the greater IT world, but are just now getting attention in the embedded space. I also wrote my master's thesis there. It's difficult to find good employees and german law makes it difficult to get rid of bad ones, so having demonstrated my competence for a year pretty much guaranteed me the full-time job post graduation.

&gt; Are you happy with your job? 

Extremely.

&gt; Is it more of a research or a development job? 

I've struggled for a while with how to answer this question without violating my NDA. I'm just gonna say: more dev.

&gt; Do you see these cars coming to the markets in the next 3-5 years?

If you mean the kind of fully automated electric 2-seater pods without steering wheels that you summon from a fleet service, as many people in this sub seem to imagine: no, no chance at all. If you mean highly automated cars that are ""on autopilot"" for 99% of the trip and only have to be monitored by the ""driver"": yes, that seems realistic. 

What we are going to see is an ever more expanded envelope of driving situations and driving tasks that the cars can handle. You can already buy from any premium OEM a car that steers itself and keeps an approrpiate speed, but only in a limited set of situations (i.e. on the highway). The generation of cars that is comming out right now expands this to many more situations, but will still not work on tiny, congested inner-city streets or on rural roads without any markings or in bad weather etc. They add new driving tasks as well, e.g. automated parking. This development path will continue to encompass an ever higher fraction of all miles driven by cars.

1) The likes of Alphabet, Apple or NVidia are often lumped into a different group, even though Alphabet and NVidia are (trying to) become suppliers and Apple is allegedly trying to become an OEM. It's important to note that the automotive divisions in those companies have hired tons of people from the automotive industry to do automotive work with the same tools in the same way everyone in the automotive industry does as well. Trying to make a distinction between ""tech"" and ""automotive"" is pointless IMO. You could just as legitimately claim that Apple aren't in the smartphone industry, because they started in the PC space. Or that VW is a sausage maker that just has an automotive division, for that matter.

2) OEM = car manufacturer. Yes, this is an incorrect usage of the term OEM, but the car manufacturers can do and say whatever the fuck they want. The companies that would be called ""OEM"" in say the computer industry are instead call suppliers. ",1458725586,d1aa6ra,t3_4bjyb2,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2016

162,[deleted],"This increases maneuverability. Therefor it makes self driving easier. This type of vehicle is also prime candidate for an autonomous vehicle only zone. Once it is shown to be a superior vehicle model then that's the way the market will go. Google compared to everyone else went for something they saw was down the road while everyone else initially behaved in a linear fashion. It's now more clear than ever why their model is superior even in the medium term. Because you won't be getting in a fully autonomous personal car and driving it where you want anytime soon.

 Zoox are going for that step beyond Google. Google's vision could occur within 2 years. They have built a car that can exist in today's environment. Zoox have a vision of how this environment can and will change and are building a vehicle for it. The quadrant design. (more efficient to build, repair, swap out parts and allows for more internal space). Bidirectional (easier to maneuver, pick up and drop off people and flourish in a non fixed infrastructure environment. Imagine as an early example of change being an empty lane or road suddenly changing from South to North bound or perhaps there is a jam of some sort. Instead of having cars stuck because you can't ask hundreds or even thousands of people to reverse their cars, all the vehicles go the opposite way.) More than 2 seats (ride sharing). 

Let me put it this way. In the morning people head typically to a concentrated area in the morning. In the evening they head back the way they came. But cars often don't make the exact same journey. Often they have to turnaround via a detour or navigate a one way system first. A daily commute for a lot of people isn't A to B and then B to A. It is A to B and then B to A via C. 

Organisations like Google are sat on a mountain of travel data already. Imagine an area in a city somewhere. It being autonomous vehicles only. In such a place road infrastructure could be managed by a single entity. Google DeepMind for example. In real time it could be changing the direction of lanes and roads. Controlling intersections and so on. No car today, not even the Google car is built for such an environment. The Zoox car will be. 

Such a zone could exist this decade. They most certainly are not putting the cart before the horse. They are not like today's multinational car manufacturers. They don't need to design a vehicle for the present mass market. ",1458854525,d1cahfu,t1_d1bs4id,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2016

165,Catbeller,"As I noted before, the only study covering all self-driving tests showed that the cars are in more accidents than human drivers would be. That being established (though denied!), what may be happening is that human drivers are smart enough to not let the cars hit them, or hit the SD car that suddenly gets in the way. But as the submissions show, the robots are not doing well. It's a basic limitation - the SDCs are basically complicated toasters. They fail (a hell lot more than toasters do), and when they do, people tend to take the blame - another guess - because the car striking is usually held responsible for the accident, no matter how bloody dumb the struck car was behaving.",1458959232,d1dryvr,t3_4bro1z,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2016

169,Kardlonoc,"&gt; Having a HQ (probably multiple around the world in different times zones) so that humans can basically be a call center for mostly SDCs is a pretty obvious idea that I never thought of.

There is a lot dyanmics that are going to change if SDC's get off the ground.

Stuff Uber and Lyft and incorperate these vechs pretty easily and get money directly from the consumer without the neeed of a driver.

Public transportataion can include cars now but also buses can become self driving as well. 

Lastly what I think is interesting is that if you own a SDC you can create a ""commune"" or group with other local SDC drivers so you can have a vech always on call. Like... when you are at work your SDC doesn't need to sit around a parking lot waiting for you but could drive someone else around.

What if there's something actually up with the cars and they start slamming people into bridges and vehicles at 70mph? People will die, and unless the corporation is guaranteeing it can bring people back from the dead they can't fix that. Even if you don't die, being in an accident then having the surgery paid for by insurance is undeniably worse than just not being in the accident in the first place, so it's really not a good option for consumers. 

And if it's not a good option for consumers, less consumers are going to buy them - you probably couldn't pay most people to get in an untested machine that can easily kill them, let alone get them to pay for it.
In turn, it means the cars don't sell well and they won't get much testing or adoption, while the public perception of self driving cars will be that they're death machines- regardless of whether they actually are.

There's also the fact that they'd open themselves up to massive liability. Your cars might be flawless but they're still driving on roads full of bad drivers, and since they have to fight to be found not liable in every single case they would spend a *lot* of money on lawyers to fight the inevitable claims from people who hit one and claimed it didn't wasn't following the law perfectly.

Companies will not release them to the public, the public would not by them, regulators wouldn't allow it if that is what looked like was happening.  Instead I am saying let companies do the testing themselves until they feel the technology is ready for prime time and then let the company, not regulators, make that call.

As to liability in the ordinary course.  Yes.  They will be opening themselves up to a lot of liability - which is why they will have to make sure the care is very, very, very safe before it is released.

No.  The first truck only leads when it and the following trucks are in self-driving mode.

Your first link is for worldwide new phone sales. Sure, in 2010 a fair number of new phones to new subscribers were not smartphones - if we're including less-developed countries.

You then provide US data, but for *all owners* (i.e. market share), not new phone sales or new subscribers - which means a 2-5 year lag.

Also very problematic is the fact that after 2008 industry analysts (including the data in your links) began to distinguish ""smartphones"" from ""feature phones"". This gives misleading results. Among new phones, smartphones were already at parity with ""feature phones"" by 2011, while the dumbphones of 2001 (those that could not access the internet, send email, or take pictures or video) were already nearly extinct among new mobile phone sales by 2010.

So the analogy I was drawing stands. By 2010, virtually nobody in a developed country was buying a Nokia 1110 - the equivalent of a human-driven car. Those were the phones I was talking about. The best-selling mobile phones in 2010 in developed countries were [all smartphones or feature phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_mobile_phones#2010), the equivalent of Level 4 self-driving cars. Very few analysts in 2001 would have predicted this, given the [visions of ""futuristic"" phones like those in The Matrix Reloaded](http://i.imgur.com/UlhtBIf.png) that prevailed at the time.

There is a trend in the media these days to assume that in the future everyone will want to live in a high rise downtown and that this is supposed to go hand-in-hand with an imagined notion that suburbs are unsustainable.
 
To the contrary, self driving and electric cars could be just as much or more of a boon for people in suburban and rural  areas. Cities suffer from plenty of issues that have nothing to do with cars. If anything, it's the suburbs that suffer from the need for cars the most and would benefit the most from having that requirement lifted. 

Downtown living is very appealing to young kids and especially college age kids. I moved away from home to the downtown of a big city at seventeen because I was so eager to live downtown and I loved it at the time. However, just like Little Jackie Piper, little boys grow up and their desires change.  It's just a fact that people get sick of cities fairly quickly. Sure, there are always going to be exceptions to the rule but for a lot of people the allure doesn't last. Hanging out in coffee shops and bars hoping to meet some new friends is extremely cool when you're in your teens and early twenties but as people get older that's not always enough to keep them downtown and there are plenty of issues besides parking that people like to get away from after living in the heart of a city for a few years.

Indeed, I'd go even further the other way and say that if self-driving cars are also going to be electric cars as many have suggested then you'd expect people to go from the suburbs into seriously rural areas precisely because that would mean we had entered a time when going off-grid was feasible. You could just run your house off of your car battery with solar panels. 

What with the popularity of tiny house concept and the hassles that they face in any kind of incorporated areas much less urban areas this seems like an easy prediction to make. One of the major issues you see over and over in /r/TinyHouses is the desire to go off-grid in rural areas but the problems of large scale electricity storage.  

Imagine how appealing it would be to the many over-educated under-employed people who don't want an oversized mortgage on an oversized house to bail out to the country and live off-grid but also be able to be downtown after sleeping in the car the whole way. Best of both worlds but no financial constraints. To me if you want to see what is most likely you've got to look at the financial issues involved. Urban living is expensive for many reasons not just because of parking and the suburbs have their own traps.

This is almost certainly overly optimistic and not the case. The current hardware (sensor suite + compute stack) required to enable a vehicle to be anywhere near fully autonomous is *very* expensive, and not suitable for use even in today's luxury cars.

I agree there are lots of advantages to having the full hardware suite on every car, but they are also very serious about margins on the Model 3.

On the other hand if only 50% want it then Tesla would be taking a big margins hit if the L4 hardware costs $1000 more than the base hardware.

L3 self-driving for $2500 would probably be quite convincing for most people, and L4 is a no-brainer I think.  In addition to this that the first year or two of production is going to be skewed towards well-optioned cars.

The cars of the future, Fei-Fei Li of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory told me, could function as “guardian angels” that quietly keep tabs on what we’re doing behind the wheel—and step in to save us when we screw up. For instance, they might learn to anticipate obstacles in the roadway, like a children’s ball bouncing into the street, and brake automatically to avoid them. Or they might sense when we’re growing tired behind the wheel and alert us before we fall asleep.

&gt;Li told me she doubts we’ll be ready to cede the wheel to fully driverless cars anytime soon.

No. But they should. The problem is it cant be regulated. But self-driving cars can. Look at self-driving trains - regulations keep them at least 90 seconds apart.

- Reduced safe driving distance between cars due to fast reaction times of computers

Did you know that many transit rail systems used to operate at faster speeds and with higher frequencies 80 years ago than they do today? 

You really think the various safety agencies like NHTSA arent going to mandate safe following distances? The fact is, today it is impossible to regulate following distances because youre talking about 200m drivers and millions of police officers.

I suspect the stats on the few cars will be astronomical and show that if the number was 100% that road deaths would drop to a freakishly low number. As the percentage of SD cars grows it will become clearer and clearer that the only deaths are being caused by manually driven cars.

This will be like the smoking arguments except with much clearer statistics. It will pretty much be:

Deaths caused by manually driven cars. %99.999999
Deaths caused by SD cars %0.000001

This will then have every person who loses a loved one in a manually driven related accident to lobby with extreme passion for self driven cars.

The insurance issue is so overplayed. There are any number of perfectly adequate and ""ethical"" solutions. 

&gt;For example, a hacker could broadcast a false warning about an incident up ahead, causing traffic to suddenly start to move slowly unnecessarily. In fact, a hacker could potentially cause traffic to stop completely by making vehicles think that there is an obstacle in front of them, leading to traffic stopping on busy roads for seemingly no reason.

If you read up on V2V security systems proposed there's nothing ""easy"" about it. And as soon as any V2V vehicle sees the information is false your token will be revoked, rectifying the problem, and you may well find yourself arrested as well. All to cause a temporary slow down at best? Ain't saying it will never happen, but it's not the kind of thing I lie awake at night worrying about. 

&gt;but the biggest issue for me is the fact that driving is fun.

288,cecilkorik,"Well, for one thing, this already happens on highways every winter. Sometimes on a massive scale. It happens due to weather, it happens when people break down or there is an accident. There are lots of reasons for traffic to become stopped that are unresolvable without outside intervention, or sometimes even with it. People are trapped for hours, or even days. Yes, it sucks. Sometimes people die. Emergency services respond to hand out supplies to people and help people who need help, but there's often little else that can be done besides waiting in your car for the weather to pass, the accidents to be cleared, and the road to be reopened. The driver, despite having a steering wheel and a license, is completely powerless to escape.

However most of the time we don't even notice these traffic stoppages in our day to day lives. Why? Because emergency services who try to deal with them as expediently as possible. They'll get a tow truck or wrecker out there and get the road cleared, they'll get police out there to get things moving, whatever is needed.

Now, what you're describing certainly is a possibility. Deadlocks of that kind can happen despite the best efforts of software to avoid it, and it is a common failure scenario for multi-threaded applications, nevermind the kind of distributed process at work in a self-driving car network. So it certainly *might* happen at some point.

So the operative question is: will this sort of situation happen more or less often with self-driving cars, and if it does happen, how quickly will it grow out of control and how quickly can it be fixed? You seem to be implying it will happen more often and take longer to fix, but personally I think the opposite is true. I don't think it's likely to happen as often as it already does, the reduction in accidents alone will take care of that. And if it does happen we have a massive network of emergency responders, tow trucks, and other resources that would be able to respond and get the situation cleared just as fast as it currently does. But it could be even faster than that. Especially in the case of a software-related jam, we could have folks in a control center somewhere, similar to air traffic controllers, watching all the cars on the road. Alerted to trouble spots, they would be able to take manual control of a few vehicles to move them off the road and clear the jam, or call emergency services if the car is broken down or damaged, or whatever else might be needed.",1460693085,d23lnuf,t3_4eurpi,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2016

A $100-300 million system is going to be quite small, so will take very few cars off the road. To make any meaningful difference, a large investment in light/heavy rail would be needed. So yes, if you look at it from just a congestion perspective it wouldn't make sense.So why do cities build streetcars? The two main reasons are to reduce the number of cars in a neighbourhood and to encourage new development/urban regeneration. For instance, the South Lake Union Streetcar in Seattle runs through an area that was previously very run down. The streetcar was built to help encourage new development and allow new residents/workers to use public transport rather than drive. As a result the neighbourhood is less car dependent and more transit/pedestrian orientated than would be otherwise. I doubt it has done much to reduce car-based congestion in Seattle, but it has created a far nicer built environment in this one neighbourhood.Instead of looking at streetcars as a transport engineering tool, you should really see them as an urban planning tool.

One is the actual driving; navigating through their immediate vicinity, staying in a lane, avoiding obstacles, etc. The other is the long range navigation of actually getting to a destination. That one basically works the same as current gps navigation apps. If the primary driving software had to make a turn because a road is blocked, the secondary navigation will reroute, the same as your nav app does if you miss a turn. 

My chances of getting stuck in standing still traffic have decreased tremendously since I started to use Waze. If there is an obstruction  and people start reporting it, Waze will start rerouting other users. This helps the users getting rerouted, obviously, but also helps drivers staying on the main route, as it eases the congestion and let's the jam break up faster.

They are trained and provided with basic resources to contain the incident. They also set up high-vis triangles and direct traffic around stalled, damaged, and disabled rigs. They solicit local help to quickly clear roadways. The best a fully self-driving rig can do is phone home and call for a tow truck while crude oil spills out all over the road.

That is based on speculation and not on published data. **Edit: I mean the part where this implies its limitations comply with the level 3 definition**

&gt;The driver is expected to be available for occasional control, but with sufficiently comfortable transition time.

That's the key here. Comfortable transition time doesn't mean professional drivers disengaging in a matter of 1-2 seconds while monitoring every minute detail of the hardware and software diagnosis system.

Google has not released data from normal drivers using their cars on the highway **while not constantly** reading on a laptop screen for symptoms of hardware/software discrepancy, only data from professional drivers using tools that will not be available to the end consumer, and which use contradicts the definition of level 3. A car is not level 3 unless proven otherwise, and the data on the reports don't indicate that those are level 3 cars.

If you read the more detailed document by the NHTSA

http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/rulemaking/pdf/Automated_Vehicles_Policy.pdf

you'll find that the reference to Google is not there and that this is added to the definition of level 3

&gt;The vehicle is designed to ensure safe operation during the automated driving mode. An example would be an automated or self-driving car that can determine when the system is no longer able to support automation, such as from an oncoming construction area, and then signals to the driver to reengage in the driving task, providing the driver with an appropriate amount of transition time to safely regain manual control. The major distinction between level 2 and level 3 is that at level 3, the vehicle is designed so that the driver is not expected to constantly monitor the roadway while driving.

So, clearly, professional drivers constantly monitoring for software/hardware discrepancies or, as in the case of the event in october, disengaging due to **unwanted maneuver of the vehicle** does not fit NHTSA's level 3 definition. The car must recognize that is not able not handle a specific situation and alert the driver with enough time in advance to take control.

Google clearly states

&gt;In events where the software has detected a technology “failure” -- i.e. an issue with the
autonomous technology that may affect the safe operation of the vehicle -- the SDC will **immediately** hand over control to the driver; we categorize these as “**immediate** manual control” disengagements. In these cases, the test driver is given a distinct audio and visual signal, indicating that **immediate** takeover is required.

and then

&gt;During the reporting period, Google’s fleet of SDCs experienced 272 such disengagements. Our
test drivers are trained and prepared for these events and the **average** driver response time of all measurable events was **0.84 seconds**.

So, they are NOT testing their vehicles under ""level 3 conditions"", therefore they can't say their cars are level 3 (and they aren't). Have they proven that they are level 3? No public data shows that. Could it be possible that they are level 3 anyway?

About a year ago, London design studio Map picked up a job from Honda. The brief called for a design for a self-driving Honda car that could, in some not-so-distant future, take passengers around the world. But the circumstances of the commission were unusual, for two reasons: (1) Map is a small firm that typically works with upstart entrepreneurs, and (2) Honda didn’t even want anything tangible or buyable from Map. The automaker wanted beautiful ideas—a concept that gazed dreamily into the future of transportation.

“Honda. Great Journey” is the result of Map’s work. It’s a gorgeously crafted brand campaign that stars seven physical prototypes, each the size of a remote-controlled car and photographed in vivid, diorama-like landscapes. Stitched together, the images depict the travels of autonomous vehicles as they retrace the world’s longest route of human migration from Nairobi, Kenya to Manaus, Brazil.

Map collaborated with Japanese studio Mori, Inc., and the firms were initially tasked with creating one concept vehicle, but the final dossier includes seven. “Once we started looking at the different terrain,” from Africa to South America, “we thought if something has to go through desert and then water and snow and ice, it’s going to be quite an interesting vehicle—like a Frankenstein monster,” Marshall says. “We weren’t really confident we could pull it off.”

Early on, Marshall and his team toured the Honda collection, a massive warehouse of archived material two hours outside of Tokyo. The collection is home to Honda’s robotics, as well as experimental vehicles powered by fuel cell technology and solar panels. After seeing the range of technology available to Honda, Marshall and his cohorts decided to create a suite of environment-specific vehicles. The Safari Drifter, for instance, incorporates Honda’s robotic lawn mowers, so that the vehicle can cut its own tracks while driving through the Savannah. The Mountain Climber, on the other hand, has robotic legs that it can deploy from its underside, should it encounter debris from a landslide.

The vehicles’ groovy looks all channel the boxy body type of a camper RV from the 1960’s. Marshall cites a slew of reasons for this. For starters, big windows and enough space for a bed would establish these vans as travel vehicles. Its owners can see the world around them while driving during the day; at night, while the vehicle intelligently takes over, they sleep. The other reason is more psychological: many consumers don’t yet know much about self-driving cars, and people are often most afraid of what they don’t understand. “We wanted to pick up the design DNA from vehicles Honda had in the 50’s and 60’s, while deploying these futuristic technologies,” Marshall says. “If we had made the vehicles themselves look overly futuristic or aggressive, they would have been perceived as science-fiction or fantasy.”

For the most part, when people talk about self-driving cars, they talk about how they’ll play out in cities. Researchers at institutions like MIT and the Illinois Institute of Technology are already speculating how autonomous vehicles will change traffic infrastructure; the first Google AV to crash did so in Mountain View, California, and involved a city bus. Honda is taking a different tack, by injecting some wanderlust into the conversation.

&gt; Clearly tech and auto companies stand to gain, but many other industries could face serious upheavals unless they are able to adapt to the many changes self-driving cars will bring to the market.

&gt; Observers believe driverless cars will make automobile transportation a whole lot safer, and McKinsey predicts they could reduce US auto accidents by 90%. While this might save insurers money on payouts in the near future, demand for insurance will ultimately decrease as risks of a car crash drop.

&gt; Plus, it&amp;#039;s entirely possible that the hardware aspect of driverless cars will quickly become commoditized, since the cars will be less dependent on mechanical components than they are presently.

&gt; While Tesla says its technology is Level 2 autonomous - a combination of two technologies designed to make driving easier - some automotive industry experts, including Ford CEO Mark Fields, believe Autopilot is a Level 3 technology.

&gt; Because the driver is theoretically freed up to work on email or watch a video while the car drives itself, the company believes it is unrealistic to expect the driver to be ready to take over at a moment&amp;#039;s notice and still have the car operate itself safely.

&gt; Volvo&amp;#039;s Drive Me autonomous car, which will launch in a public pilot next year, is a Level 4 autonomous car - this means not only will it drive itself down the road, but it is capable of handling any situation that it comes across without any human intervention.

Sure. And 40 years from now it will be perfectly legal for you to build a car. But that car you build today can't be driven on public roads unless the driver is licensed. To be licensed you have to pass a test and prove that you're a competent driver. 

And if you believe the government will allow unlicensed software on the road you're delusional. The software will be tested exhaustively to ensure it is competent at its task. So build your self driving car in the future, nobody is going to stop you. Drive it on private property all you want.

I disagree, and you haven't been able to elucidate one meaningful difference between the two concepts.

You're free to believe you'll be able to modify it however you like, but I'd bet every cent I have you'll be disappointed.

393,Ol0O01100lO1O1O1,"&gt; Angry? on the internet? no.

Your comments indicate otherwise. 

&gt;Sure I did. one applies to a person and the other does not typically apply to a person. You don't ""certify"" people that is simply not the word you typically use (in this context mind you) the license ""certifies"" that you are able to operate a car. the fact that I can use both words in the same sentence and have them not be the same thing is point me. win.

I've used that analogy over and over again on this forum and you're the first person to ever have a problem with it. I get that it could be confusing, but you asked and it was resolved. There's no conspiracy to try and make you feel like an idiot or something--it was a misunderstanding and it was resolved. You should have let it drop a long time ago. 

And, in fact, it wont surprise me at all if they actually use the word ""license"" to refer to the process for approving automated car software in keeping with a century of tradition. 

&gt;Don't have a choice. when people give unclear vague replies that appear to use odd words in odd context I don't have a choice.

You don't have a choice but to lose your cool? Bullshit. Again, I don't care if it was the world's worst phrasing on my part (and again, nobody else seems to have a problem with it). You're still inventing some kind of evil intent and being an ass over nothing. Every time somebody says something that you don't understand do you turn it into a fight? If so I feel really sorry for the people in your life. 

&gt;we went from talking about self driving car software to talking about me having a drivers license. (again context is everything)

You asked where you draw the line, I specified what is a very clear place to draw the line. The driver, whether human or computer, must be licensed (feel free to substitute certified if you have to be anal about it) to operate the vehicle. As soon as you alter the driving software, it is no longer licensed. 

There was no change of subject. 

&gt;you broke context and refused to clarify and kept playing words games.

Really? Go back and read my response again. It did not break context. It did clarify. There were no word games. I cleared up any confusion. You're just inventing stuff to complain about now, and the proof is that you won't be able to support your claim with anything I actually said. 

&gt;I do not recognize any law that tries to control what I ""personally"" do with my own personal property. 

OK. It's not my job to try and force you to follow the law... and this will almost certainly be the law. Your actions are totally on you. 

&gt;There is no provision in the constitution that permits then to make such restrictions (short of me harming others) therefore any such restrictions are illegal (9th and 10th amendments)

The same provisions that allow the government to require a license for a human to operate a vehicle on the road. 

&gt;I also do not recognize DRM and don't recognize any restrictions on what I can do with my purchases regarding DRM. the DMCA is not US law. its illegal enforced us decree. (as per the constitution)

I really don't care what your personal interpretations of the law are. I don't mean that hatefully, I just truly don't care. 

&gt;I am a reflection of you. if you stop being hostile I stop being hostile (being obstinate is hostile in this context)

OK, I actually laughed out loud at this. 

&gt;Besides that I don't think I am being hostile. cagey and caution?.

I'll be happy to quote some of your comments, given your apparent difficulty determining what is hostile. 

&gt;Just look through my post history and the inane arguments people come up with.

No. And stop taking out your frustrations with other people on me.

There are many complications merely in the interpretation of sensor data alone that it seems they are ignoring, and they technically *can* since most will not necessarily be a safety issue, but it will cause practical problems.

Tesla is more realistic in their goals than Google is in my opinion, they can try new things and offer performance that couldn't be made safe without supplementation from the driver. That's the way it's gone in aviation, because we still run into safety issues (albeit much more serious safety issues than in automobiles but regardless) all the time despite enormous investment into precise and redundant, often triple-redundant infrastructure on the ground. Autonomous cars don't even have *that*, they have to rely completely on the ability of the onboard computer to solve problems just with sensor data, and it's not nearly ""intelligent"" enough to interpret many things correctly.

434,ianuilliam,"I'm not denying that modern cars are massively better than horses and wagons. But the first horseless carriages were in the 1700s. It took almost 200 years, until the 1930s, for them to eclipse horses to the point where they completely replaced them. That was a very long iterative process. Yes, society has been altered in tremendous ways by cars.  But it was a gradual change. It took centuries from the first prototype until something that was acceptable by the public, and decades after that for it to really have profound effects on society. 

The self driving car revolution will occur over a much shorter time frame, because it is a much more disruptive technology. The difference between the first cars and the horse drawn buggies of the day was that you didn't have to feed and care for a horse, but instead had to buy fuel and maintain the car. The difference between cars and the first (fully) self driving cars will be that your commute now becomes extra time to sleep, work, read, browser dank memes, etc., versus hours of your day wasted. Multiple people being able to share one vehicle by being able to send it back home after arriving at their destination. Elderly, youth, or disabled people who cannot drive having freedom of mobility without having to rely on someone else. Trucks being able to run 24/7 instead of being limited by the number of miles or hours that the driver is able, or allowed, to drive. 

These are much more impactful changes than horse drawn buggies to horseless carriages, and it's a fact that more disruptive technologies have drastically faster adoption rates. Even if it takes, as you suggest, 10-15 years for adoption to hit the critical mass that will lead to the revolution we are ""pining for,"" that will be one of the most rapid adoptions of new technology in human history.",1462371261,d2sfh0q,t1_d2sdet8,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2016

444,DaffyDuck,"&gt;Half of all buyers...wont pay for autonomous driving

Napkin math for USA with some assumptions:

Accidents attributable to human error: 94%

Average annual insurance premium per car: $1200

Insurance premium percentage dedicated to payouts: 70%


Saved per year assuming 90% reduction in payouts to self driving car owners: $756

Average life of a new vehicle: 8 years

Saved over vehicle life: $6048

If the self driving gear costs less than around $6000 you'll probably save money just based on insurance alone.  It'll probably work out even better because the estimated 25% overhead in insurance should shrink as claims decline and if automakers like Volvo start insuring the vehicles, they may decide not to take much profit for the insurance.  So if you reduce overhead by 10% and profit by 3% that's another $1100 over the life of the vehicle.  Lots of assumptions here but it's not outlandish.

446,EauRougeFlatOut,"&gt;self driving cars will be that your commute now becomes extra time to sleep, work, read, browser dank memes, etc., versus hours of your day wasted.

This only happens once the technology matures. Like I've said elsewhere in this thread, if fully automated control of these vehicles were realistic for consumer applications in the near future it would have happened in civil aviation already. Airlines want SO badly to save money on pilot wages, and if they could do away with the right seat and have the captain be the redundancy, they would do it. Boeing would have it in the works right now. I'm not saying they're not looking into it, but the technology is nowhere near where it would have to be to field it even for customers paying $200+ million *per aircraft*. And that's in an industry where nearly everything is done by a procedure, pilot training is basically programming a human brain to work as a machine, and we have enormous infrastructure allowing automation already. If anywhere is ripe for the fully-automated revolution it's in aviation, and it hasn't happened yet, which doesn't bode well for an optimistic automation timeline for cars.

For the foreseeable future, self driving cars will require oversight and occasional manual input from a driver, the same as in aircraft. The automotive industry by the way has a long way to go in the realm of automation even just to get to the level of aviation, let alone all the way to eliminating all human oversight. It'll be quicker for them since they can program cop-outs like having the vehicle just stop immediately if the computer gets confused, but that in itself is dangerous and impractical.

&gt;I'm not denying that modern cars are massively better than horses and wagons. But the first horseless carriages were in the 1700s. It took almost 200 years

&gt;The difference between the first cars and the horse drawn buggies of the day was that you didn't have to feed and care for a horse, but instead had to buy fuel and maintain the car.

Alright, you *are* being disingenuous. You're completely neglecting to mention the difference in speed between cars and horses, the difference in carrying capacity, the difference in maintenance and fuel (food) costs, the difference in convenience. Dare I mention sanitary concerns?

And also, if you want to start with the ""cars"" invented in the 1700s then you should also start with cruise control when talking about automation. For reasonable people, the beginning of the automobile revolution was just before 1880 with the Otto Cycle and the contributions of Maybach and Benz.

&gt;These are much more impactful changes than horse drawn buggies to horseless carriages, and it's a fact that more disruptive technologies have drastically faster adoption rates.

Everybody taking a taxi everywhere from now on, driven by a human or not, rather than driving their own car, is quite obviously not a more significant leap forward than the taxi/car itself. It won't be a more significant change in our society either. A lot of people don't realize what a difference high speed mass transportation did for our society, but I'll put to you that there is nothing that correlates more closely to society development than the speed it can communicate or transport ideas or goods. Maybe one day driverless cars will improve our ability to do that, but for a very long time the benefit will be purely one of convenience and efficiency. Unless you live somewhere like LA where the place has practically no public transportation, is too big to get around by foot, and yet too packed for fast transportation by car (which btw is unlike most US cities, or 1st world ones for that matter), driverless cars will not vastly decrease the amount of time it takes for you to do things like the first automobiles at the beginning of the 20th century. The adoption rate will be curbed by that fact alone - even before considering the downsides of not owning your own vehicle, the fact that the technology will take potentially a decade to mature, the legislation and legal difficulties, public perception nonsense, etc.

I'm tired of this argument. You're arguing with a proponent of self-driving vehicles because I'm not enthusiastic or optimistic enough about their deployment schedule. The fact is that I have a lot of experience with vehicle automation, more than most people who read this subreddit, and I have seen the way this whole trend has gone over the last 30 years. I'm telling you the difficulties with it, the technical and practical challenges, that Tesla and Google haven't even reached yet. They're still in the early stages of even getting cars to behave under human oversight, and you best believe it's a *very* big leap from where we are today to full automation. Bigger than it was to get from adaptive cruise control to here. So we'll see what happens, but I'm trying to be realistic about the timeframe and the outcome.",1462392044,d2svgzr,t1_d2sfh0q,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2016

With the self driving car, the entire city will be available for delivery for nearly free. You can setup your kitchen in the cheapest space in town if you want. The best food wins.

There's also going to be a lot of business out there for construction contractors. I think turning garage space into a rental suite or mother in law suite will be very popular. Some contractors will specialize in it and be able to quote a standard price for a one car or two car garage.

If self driving vehicles plow into other vehicles and pedestrians less or more frequently than human drivers that still tells you a lot even though nobody died. 

I would expect to see some kind of tiered licensing process. Demonstrate X hours of professionally supervised driving without incident to get a ""trial license"" that comes with whatever restrictions. Demonstrate 10X hours at that level to get a provisional license that allows you to sell/operate X number of vehicles (say 1,000 to 10,000).

Travelling with kids is already tough enough even owning your own car. Now imagine you have to order from a car service. Unless a decent chunk of self driving vehicles are going to be carrying around 4+ car seats, you're going to have to wait longer than most for a vehicle that has the car seats you need--remember different sized kids require different car seats. Unless the seats are permanently installed you're going to have to install them, which can be time consuming. Then you're going to have to adjust them; again taking more time. After you make a 10 minute stop at the store you're likely to have a different vehicle so you get to repeat the process. Kids make a huge mess in cars, so at the end of every trip you're going to have to spend 10 minutes cleaning up with screaming kids or get hit with cleaning charges. 

And instead of keeping changes of clothes, diapers, snacks, blankets, toys, wipes, strollers, and everything else in your vehicle at all times you have to lug it with you everywhere you go. And do you really want your kid in a car seat 20 other kids have drooled on, shit in, and rubbed peanut butter all over that day? 

If you've got two screaming kids are you going to want to stand around waiting even a few minutes when demand is high waiting for a vehicle? 

Even if fleet service is cheaper--and I don't think we'll see *nearly* the price advantage, if any, that many on this forum envision comparing equivalent vehicles--are you not going to be willing to pay the extra for the convenience of your own vehicle? 

The difference may not be as great for the rest of us, but there is still significant utility in having a vehicle that is tailored to your needs; where you can store stuff you may need as well as temporary items like shopping bags; that is always available for your needs. 

Even things that may be grouped under ""emotional attachment"" may have real world benefit to people. Things like demonstrating wealth or personal style--human beings aren't some homogenous, faceless block. 

Finally I think people make a lot of miscalculations when comparing the two modes. For example they assign all the benefits of self driving, electric cars to fleet service exclusively, without allowing the fct you can reap many of those benefits with privately owned self driving electric vehicles. They utilize studies showing how efficient homogenous fleets can be (without realizing such simulations *frequently* overstate benefits) while talking about the advantages of having any kind of vehicle you want on demand without realizing such diversity of choice impacts efficiency. The fail to realize that if you just need a specialized vehicle occasionally it is still affordable to rent that for the occasion even if you own. The list goes on. 

All that being said I still think fleet service is going to be *huge*, I just can't see it being universal. I'd guess anywhere from 25-75%, depending on many factors we just can't know yet. ",1462807792,d2yobgs,t1_d2xz48z,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2016

487,tidderwork,"&gt; But nobody will actually own personal cars at all. Meaning nobody ever needs to park at their destination anymore.

You were doing great until those sentences. There are SO many reasons to own a personal car, self-driving or not, that will never go away. 

Consider weekend shopping. What am I supposed to do with the $300 worth of home renovation supplies I just bought as I stop at the liquor store and grocery store on the way home? Am I supposed to carry hundreds of pounds of stuff around the grocery store while I pick up mixers and ice? Is the car supposed to just drive around the store (wasting energy/fuel and polluting) while I'm inside? Am I supposed to let the car drive me all the way home, and then drive me back in to town to buy ice and mixers?

What about people that carry around personal items (umbrellas, chargers, entertainment devices, changes of clothes, drugs/medicine, reusable shopping bags), work items (tools, papers, equipment), and survival gear?

Where am I supposed to put my dinner leftovers, heavy coats, and other stuff when I take my wife to dinner and a movie?

Where are my visiting associates supposed to keep their briefcases and bags while we go out for a beer between meetings at different buildings?

These questions don't even begin to touch on the personal needs for specialized vehicles or the fact that millions of people live in rural places. I regularly need a vehicle that is 4WD and fitted with all-terrain tires, can tow a boat, can double as a camper, can be scratched/beaten/dented, has external lighting capable of illuminating an outside work space at night, and be readily available throughout the day/weekend/week. At what point will it be cheaper to rent a vehicle with those characteristics (including the wear and tear I put on it during my use) than to own one? And who would want to use it after I'm done with it? I know I'd be upset if I rented a vehicle and it showed up with scratched paint, dented fenders, a bent bumper, mud on the carpet, the smell of deer urine soaked in to the seats, and cigar smoke layered on everything.

Self-driving cars do not eliminate a person's need to carry stuff around during the day. It just eliminates the need to hold a steering wheel. There will always be parking lots, and a need to store vehicles that aren't occupied but are still ""in use."" 

It's fair to say that the vast majority of everyday travel that people do can be satisfied by a car-sharing service. It's a ridiculous leap to think that ALL private vehicle ownership will go away, or that vehicles will never need to be parked.

Why would a self-driving car be incredibly expensive to insure privately? It should be far cheaper than insuring my current 6500 lb meat missile. The prevailing wisdom suggests that insurance rates for any self-driving car will drop to almost nothing regardless of ownership.

492,DaffyDuck,"&gt; As SDC's become more common, insurance and purchase prices will go up. That will perpetuate it's own cycle as less people buy them because of the price.

No, insurance will go down for privately owned SDC's.  Can you provide some sources that support your claim?

http://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1099572_how-much-cash-will-an-autonomous-car-save-you-more-than-1000-per-year

&gt;non-SDC's will slowly become prohibitively expensive. It's going to happen. Owning a car will become a hobby or luxury due to it's expense. You can want a place for your umbrella all you want. But your not going to pay $5K a year just to keep it nearby all year round. More likely people will just buy a second umbrella and keep it at the office.

This seems a bit naive.  I think we all agree that private ownership will be reduced, it's a question of how much.  My car costs me about 44 cents per mile including gas and insurance.  The estimates I've seen for self driving taxis go as low as 50 cents per mile.  That would not work out for me.

Also, I expect SDCs to offer more privacy.  As a realist, I know what that means and personally I don't want to sit on a seat that the previous passenger jizzed, peed, or puked on.  What I think will **actually** happen is that shared cars will have camera and audio surveillance to keep passengers in line and to protect the owner's investment while privately owned cars will offer more privacy than current cars (like completely tinted windows).

Also, the auto manufacturers are incentivized to get people to own their own cars so they will continue to provide good reasons to be a car owner.  I think we'll see a lot more car sharing at the family level.  Families that have 2 cars may decide to just have one.  Kids won't get their own car at age 16 anymore.  Etc.

28,fricken,"The weird thing is that Levandowski had a huge role to play in developing a great deal of the IP Google owns around Streetview and self driving cars. The other thing is Google has paid Levandowski handsomely for that IP.

Levandowski has sold 3 companies to Google since he began there, working on Streetview in 2007. Google bought 510 systems (Levandowski's Lidar company), Anthony's Robots, and some other company (it hasn't been disclosed AFAIK) for a combined $500 million. 

On top of that, there is the purported [Fuck You Money](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-13/one-reason-staffers-quit-google-s-car-project-the-company-paid-them-so-much) Levandowski and other veterans of the Self Driving car project received for reaching important milestones. Levandowski was possibly close to being a billionaire even before the Otto acquisition. 

Google made Anthony Levandowski stinking rich. Did that buy his loyalty? No. He ran off to Uber. I don't see how any Alphabet exec, no matter how impartial, could interpret that as anything less than an out and out betrayal. 

And while everything has been twisted out of shape in the media feeding frenzy, Uber's cars in San Francisco actually came out of the starting gate working really creepily well, all things considered. The SF cars were working much better than Uber's Pittsburgh cars put together by the people Uber had hired before Kalanick appointed Levandowski the top 
 general of Uber's autonomy division. [A bunch of top roboticists have left Uber since Levandowski joined.](http://www.recode.net/2016/12/12/13920558/uber-self-driving-cmu-top-engineers-leave). There's something fishy going on. It happened so fast. 

With regards to criminal charges, if Alphabet really wanted to do that, they would have to hand the case over to the FBI, they would lose control over it, and all kinds of skeletons would come out of the closet. So I'm betting Alphabet would prefer to settle out of court, and whether or not they can settle out of court depends on whether or not Uber feels like fighting this out to the death.

30,Drogans,"&gt; Going to the end. Could Alphabet and this lawsuit really end Uber?

Easily.   Waymo's suit could scare off the investors Uber needs to survive.  Even if external investors continue to pour in money, the suit will prevent Uber from using the self driving car tech they've spent billions on.  It will put Uber years behind their competition in self driving.

Uber requires constant external investment in order to subsidize both riders and drivers.  It's been estimated that these subsidizes average around 40%.  That's simply unsustainable in the longer term.  Sooner or later, Uber needs to sell its products for *more* than the cost of production.

Uber can only sell its products below the cost of production so long as the external investors keep dumping money into the company.  Once the investor dollars stop (or greatly slow down) Uber has two choices, stop the subsidies, or run out of cash.  

If they run out of cash, they die, so the subsidies will go first.

First they'll lower driver subsidies, Uber drivers will receive less pay. This will push drivers to competitors like Lyft or out of the market entirely.  This won't be enough to stop the hemorrhaging, so they'll then scale back rider subsidies, raising the fees to user Uber's services.  This will move riders to companies like Lyft, traditional taxi cabs, and their own vehicles.  These will slow down Uber's cash burn rate, but the cash will continue to burn, and their market share will dwindle. 

When Uber runs out of cash, the company dies. 

&gt; New leadership could be installed, much of which would presumably come from Alphabet 

If Alphabet can decapitate the entire executive suite, including Kalanick, it would raise the possibility of a deal.  In that case, one imagines Alphabet would then effectively be running Uber.  

Kalanick and his cadre would likely fight to the death to keep this from happening, so it seems an unlikely outcome.

&gt; They're still raking it in hand over fist

Read that Bloomberg article again.  They make clear in the final paragraphs that Uber is losing big money.  They are reported to have lost 800 million in 2016 Q4 alone.  That's simply not sustainable.

IMHO - Alphabet does not **want** to own Uber.  Why would they?  The Uber brand is tainted with the sins of their ""bro"" culture.  Uber's special sauce isn't special at all.  Google (Waymo) could whip up a ride-sharing software platform in a month or two, they probably already have one in testing.  Uber's self driving car platform is a stolen product with no value to anyone.

The devastating allegations in the lawsuit suggest Alphabet doesn't want to own Uber.  It suggests that want Uber dead.

* Waymo begins building kits that can be retrofitted to any production line car (or at least major models)
* Uber offers two tracks for their would-be drivers - be a driver, or be a car host who allows their car to be retrofitted (at a small investment fee that you could pay through revenue generated by your vehicle)
* Waymo / Uber provides mobile hot spots as a part of the retrofitting package; this is provided free of charge to consumers if they accept Google-served advertising.

44,sircier,"I read the link you provided, I find it a lot of hand waving and sometimes even outright stupid. Take this paragraph for example:

&gt; When retrofitting an already existing vehicle with a windshield, a steel plate could be mounted behind it, insulating driver and passengers from flying glass in the event of an accident. Taking this one step further, all inner surfaces, including the steel plate, could be padded, removing the necessity for potentially dangerous and unpredictable air bags.

I have several issues with this:

* I don't want to be in a steel box. I want to be able to look outside, certainly if I don't have to drive myself. To look at a beautiful sunset or a spectacular mountain view for example, not to mention the claustrophobia this will introduce.

* You'll have to show me that replacing all airbags with padding is equally effective at decelerating a person in case of an accident. One of the main advantages of an airbag is that they are small when not used and only become large when needed. Padding would add a lot of volume and mass.

But these are only details, it does not cover why SDCs would be impossible. In the post before the one you linked, u/doktorgosh goes into detail why it wouldn't be possible. The arguments are the same I've heard from non-believers before: bad weather conditions, poor roadmarking and technical malfunctions. This shows, in my opinion, a lack of faith in humanity. As u/doktorgosh mentions, tons of money are being pumped into solving these issues. Experts are being bought out of universities and into these companies. CPUs and GPUs are being developed especially for this purpose. These people have invested massive amounts of money and want a return on their investment. That requires the legislative hurdle to be cleared. Lawmakers will set standards that self driving cars have to achieve (better than human capabilities, roughly 1 death per million driven miles).

I would rather use a human-driven taxi as well, because current self-driving cars are not proven to be better than humans. The non-lidar Teslas have been swerving out of their lanes and there was also a death. Lidar-based cars have much better track record, but common consumers really have no idea what lidar is, or how to judge the safety of any self-driving car. They understand their ignorance, and take the precaution of waiting. 
  
The first successful self-driving taxis should help consumer image and regulations.  

The main hurdle is *proving* superior safety. Imagine a super bowl commercial: Mock highway covered in black ice, snow blowing sideways, semi trucks falling over every which way. Then a self-driving car drives around all the chaos and destruction effortlessly, detecting the wheel slippage, predicting where the semis will fall, and maintaining proper traction the whole time. Cut to a quiet interior shot of kids playing on ipads inside, nobody watching the road.

51,Drogans,"&gt; You saying they worked with Levandowski to steal is not an accusation even being made.

Of course the accusation has been made.  It's all fully in evidence.

Levandowski *is* alleged to have met with Uber while still a Google employee.  He *is* alleged to have planned Otto as an interim, technology holding company, to later be purchased by Uber.  He *is* alleged to have perused Otto funding from Uber while he was still employed at Google (which is theft, as he was still bound to his employment contract with Google).   Most importantly, he *is* alleged to have negotiated a transfer of Google's technology to Uber, while still employed at Google. 

Here is just one of the many passages relating to these allegations: ""Levandowski was spotted at Uber’s headquarters sometime in January 2016, shortly before he left to form Otto. “I asked Mr. Levandowski about this, and he admitted he had met with Uber, and the reason he was there was that he was looking for investors for his new company,” Droz testifies."" http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/10/14884666/alphabet-waymo-google-uber-lawsuit-testimony-block

&gt; Uber may lose the use of the Lidar. There are plenty of sources for Lidar.

The *head* of Uber's self driving is the primary individual implicated in the theft.  Everyting he touched within Uber's self driving program will be suspect, and he likely touched *everything*.

Most of Uber's self driving technology will be fruit of the poisoned tree, and the onus will be on Uber to prove any given technology has not been derived from that stolen from Google.  It's likely an impossible feat. 

They would need to wipe out their self driving division and start from scratch.

&gt; Kill Uber? Bankrupt Uber? Not a chance. 

Not liking a truth doesn't make less untrue.  

&gt; Uber doesn't even need their own SDC program as they have auto partners who have their own programs.

Maybe if Uber had 5 years.  They don't have 5 years.

Who are their other auto maker partners, other than Volvo?  Who else?  From most accounts, none of the auto makers have neared the technological competency of Waymo.  They're years and years behind.  Uber cannot afford to be years behind, as they're burning money at a rate of $800 million per quarter.  

&gt; Uh, no. Uber spends to grow. If the investments stop, they just stop growing so aggressively,

Yes, but that business model assumes the firm will receive continued funding while in the unprofitable growth phase.

55,Drogans,"&gt; Driving this suit all the way to an extreme conclusion to ""send a message"" would not be rational .

Perhaps, but by that logic, filing this suit in the first place made no sense.  By far, the safest move to secure Google's equity would have been to have quietly demanded a settlement, never filing suit at all.

Google didn't do this.  They didn't even file a mild suit.  They filed a full bore suit, including what appear to be criminal allegations.

This isn't the kind of suit one files when angling for a deal.  This is the kind of suit companies file when they're trying to destroy the other party.

&gt; It's far less in their interest in trying to build or patch together something on their own. 

The market that Google (Waymo) intends for their technology has changed over time.  It is not even abundantly clear what Wamo's intended use for their tech is any longer.

More than a few analysts suspect Waymo **does** very much wants to run a ride sharing rival to Uber.  The thesis is that Waymo will sell SDC hardware to any and all auto manufacturers at a price lower than the automakers could acomplish themselves.  In exchange, all Waymo powered vehicles will be mandated to use the Waymo self driving network, if the vehicle owners wish to use a self-driving network.

This would be perfectly legal, as Waymo would only be licensing the software.  The licensing terms would make use restrictions clear.

&gt; Driving this suit all the way to an extreme conclusion to ""send a message"" would not be rational .

Disagree.  Alphabet has only around half a billion of actual cash invested into Uber.  They may believe that's a small price to pay in order to stop the seemingly rampant theft of Google's intellectual property. Google may also feel that Uber was likely doomed either way.

Simply by filing this suit, the ""extreme conclusion"" you suggest may already be fated.  If external investors are scared off by this lawsuit (and they should be), then Uber is already a dead man walking.  Google need do nothing but keep the lawsuit running to assure Uber's death.

If so, wrong again.

It is most certainly being alleged that Uber conspired with Levandowski to steal Google's technology.  It's not proof (yet) but the allegation has certainly been made, under penalty of perjury.

Quote: ""This conversation did not surprise me. Mr. Levandowski had previously told me, in or around the summer of 2015, that he had talked with Brian McClendon, an Uber executive involved with their self-driving car project. We were having dinner at a restaurant near the office, and he told me that it would be nice to create a new self-driving car startup and that Uber would be interested in buying the team responsible for the LiDAR we were developing at  Google. ""

""Later in January 2016, a colleague told me that Mr. Levandowski had been seen at
Uber’s headquarters in mid January. I asked Mr. Levandowski about this, and he admitted he had
met with Uber, and the reason he was there was that he was looking for investors for his new

60,Drogans,"&gt; Uber customers don't have brand loyalty, so investing as a customer acquisition cost is an ineffective strategy unless the functionally kill their competitors. 

Exactly right.

The strategy only works if Uber can become a de facto monopoly.  It may have been a possibility at one point, but as each day, and each successive scandal emerges, the likelihood becomes ever more remote. 

Which raises the question, if Uber no longer has a realistic possibility of achieving a near monopoly position, what is the point of continuing the subsidies?  At a guess, the only present day rationale for continuing the subsidies is retention of market share.  Were market share to sharply drop, so would the sky-high valuation and the continual external investment Uber needs to survive.

&gt; This makes all of his work suspect and potentially unusable. 

Agreed, and interestingly, Uber's leadership has been quite public in their belief that if Uber falls behind in self driving, the company will be left behind.  We should fully expect this to be Uber's defense to Waymo's injunction demand.

Using Uber CEO Travis Kalanick's logic, if (when) the courts *do* take away Uber's stolen self driving tech,  the company will be doomed.

62,Drogans,"&gt; This is big but it strikes me that Intel are desperate. 

Agreed. They're over-spending while they have the money in hopes that one of these gambles will emerge into a large revenue center.  

Intel's market dominance and stunning margins are coming to an end.  They're now facing challenges from ARM and AMD in the data center, ARM running X86 Windows, Macs likely moving to ARM, and AMD in the consumer space.  Market share erosion will take time, but their sky-high margins will fall more quickly.   It's only a matter of time until Intel's revenues tumble.

ARM is the future.  Intel cannot compete against the cooperative money and mind share of all of massive organizations co-developing ARM.  Of course ARM isn't open source, but ARM's licensing fees are so low that it's the closest approximation in the CPU space.  

If Waymo and / or Apple become the primary OEM self driving car system integrators for auto makers,  Intel may realize little gain from this purchase.  This because Waymo and Apple should have little to fear from Intel / Mobileye on the patent front.  The Alphabet companies and Apple each have enough patents to play the game of mutually assured destruction.  Were Intel to demand licensing fees from Waymo and Apple customers, they would risk retaliatory litigation from the two largest public companies in the world.

- You never, never, ever, leave your lane

So when the situation is:

&gt; A kid is coming from the right side and your car cant break fast enough

Then the kid *is* getting run down.

- swerve into the oncoming lane? No
- swerve into parked cars? No

--------------

The car shall not leave the lane unless it is safe to do so. The car shall not make ethical decisions. 

Autonomous cars do not need ethics or morals.

In the contrived situations (contrived because we've decided that it's impossible stop in time, and there's no safe place to go), the answer is always:

&gt; [They're getting run over.](https://np.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/27n3q7/would_a_google_car_sacrifice_you_for_the_sake_of/ci2nbi4):

I'm not saying that like it's a good thing, or something we should strive for.
 
Of **course** the car will slam on its brakes. But the hypothetical is that the car cannot stop in time. The child will get run down. 
 
Which is exactly what would happen if i were driving. I would do the best I can, but the reality is i'm not going to drive into an incoming tractor trailer, or onto the sidewalk.
 
The child is getting run over. 

In the end it is an unfortunate accident. Because the car was autonomous doesn't change that.

--------------------------------

There's a concept that people are going to have to get used to with self driving cars. 

Self-driving cars are *much* safer than human drivers. Each year 30,000 people in the US, and over a million worldwide, die in car accidents. If everyone switched to self driving cars, and we could cut that number in **half**, that would be an **extraordinary** success. 

Here comes the part that people need to get next to: 

- 15,000 people a year in the US, and 500 thousand worldwide, would still die in a self-driving car

You have two alternatives: 

- 30,000 people a year die in car accidents 
- 15,000 people a year die in case accidents

The lower number is better. Saving 15,000 lives is what we want to do. The lower number is what we want. 

&gt; We **want** 15,000 people a year to die in self driving cars. 

Self driving cars don't have to be perfect; nor will they ever be. They just have to be better than humans.

A car is not allowed to leave it's lane unless it is safe to do so. That means:

- a car driven by a human is not allowed to leave its lane unless it is safe to do so
- a car driven by a computer is not allowed to leave its lane unless it is safe to do so

You don't avoid accidents by causing accidents. The head-on accident is better than the side-swipe accident. And hitting a stationary car, is better than having a head-on collision in the oncoming lane. *(i.e. the devil you know beat the devil you don't)*

And besides: you don't leave you lane unless it is safe to do so. And you **don't** drive onto a sidewalk or into a building.

If you are faced with the decision of:

- hitting a family of four, or
- driving onto the sidewalk and hitting a homeless drug dealing murderer pedophile

You run down the family of four.

You don't leave your lane**.**

66,aagoodey,"Stating the cost is not really the same as boasting, and these are very different products. Google have done some work to resolve one of the price problems early on in the self driving game, which was the high purchase cost of a high resolution dynamic lidar unit for R&amp;D, which has, among other investments and intelligent approaches, saved their project money (let's say, $10k per car x 100 cars... that's $1m they can spend on other stuff - that's sensible, because that saving can equip those cars each with several other sensors). They've done that because their attitude to the project has not been constrained by the same structures and traditions that exist in most other industrial supply chains.  In automotive, for example, it's pretty rare that car manufacturers do their own R&amp;D like that... when they do, it's largely because they are dominant giants or unusual disruptive forces (Tesla, Google, etc) - there are a few companies that are small and nimble, and intelligently run, like McLaren, for example - but like most big race-connected organisations, they have a long history of making their own bits (if you're interested, Red Bull F1 have done a great series of YouTube docs including one which follows the life of a single bolt). Anyway, back to the topic... The existing automotive technology supply chain really is set up for bulk manufacture of production units, so the $100-$250 price point that I talk about so often is really not the same.  A few of those companies do offer individual R&amp;D units for that sort of cost though.
It's also worth pointing out that should Google/Waymo suddenly need 10,000 of their LiDAR units made, they would immediately go to one of their existing partner manufacturers to provide fulfillment, then that unit cost would also plummet.

Yes, like almost any device maker, fewer moving parts, fewer warranty repairs, lower costs.  That said, moving parts can be made with extreme reliability.  Refrigerator compressors for instance.  They cost a few dollar to make and tend to reliably function for decades.

If dynamic LIDAR units retain their vast technically superiority to the phased array (non-dynamic) units, wouldn't the car makers grudgingly accept the reality that they'll need a moving unit?  

$1000 for a dynamic unit with superior performance, or $750 for 3, $250 phased arrays with far worse performance?  Every dollar counts, but so does minimum performance.  If the phased array units can't meet minimum performance requirements, might not the dynamic units actually see commercial production, at least until the solid state units are technically competitive?

$1000 for a single component is a lot, even in a premium vehicle, but if that component allows level 4 self driving, it would likely be an acceptable trade off.

I sympathise that it's upsetting but if full SDVs enter the market then it's only ethical that manual driving be phased out. The right to a hobby shouldn't outweigh other's right to life. There could still be track days and places where it's legal to go and drive manually, so long as no third parties are endangered.

&gt;the manuals that probably will be left will be driven by people with great car control and better than a computer.

The thing is even if SDVs are only a bit safer than the average person they'd have the benefit of being reliable. Even the best drivers in the world make mistakes and unless we come up with a far stricter system of evaluating driving (like rigging the remaining manual cars with sensors to continually judge the skill of the driver, adding penalty points for every minor mistake) it's just safer to make the switch.

&gt;In all honesty though I don't see this happening in my lifetime self driving is going to go wrong imo

I don't think anyone in the field or those supporting it would claim that SDVs aren't going to have accidents, especially at first. But if they have fewer accidents than humans then more lives, property and money is saved. That's a great justification to keep going.

&gt;I bet it'll get hacked aswell that'll kill and injure people.

That's assuming it can be hacked. A simple way to stop that would be to not include the ability to make software updates, or to do so for only very minor things. In other words the core self driving software is isolated.

Do you mean the proposal is stupid? There is a hell of a lot of money and support suggesting it isn't.

It's their largest leg, accounting for around 60% of their annual sales.

The Bosch directors must be terribly conflicted.  They're facing two massive, somewhat unrelated, but quickly developing challenges.  One is self driving, the other is electric vehicles.   Each seem to threaten a wide swath of Bosch's automotive product lines.  Together, they produce an existential threat to the company.

Bosch is a huge OEM supplier, so an intentional delay could, possibly, hold back the reckoning.  The obvious risk is that if Bosch slow-walks development, it could allow competitors to jump ahead.  

It's not surprising that Bosch isn't on board with a quick move to self driving electrics.  It threatens far too many of their silos.",1489787091,df2iimw,t1_df2c9fc,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2017

96,manicdee33,"I do not use LiDAR to drive as it stands. My driving is entirely based on stereo vision (and even then, lack of such is not going to stop people driving), with sensors that can simultaneously handle edge detection, pattern recognition and image flow.

Ultimately it should be possible to produce an autopilot which is just a couple of cameras and a landmark database which can navigate a vehicle as safely as a human can. No need for LiDAR, RADAR, ultrasonics, or other fancy high resolution mapping tools or proximity sensing hardware.

The fixation with LiDAR is due to boffins who started out on the assumption that a self driving car will necessarily need higher resolution maps of the real world than humans would ever have need of. This idea that high tesolution maps are needed is going to hold back serious development for a couple of decades until the ""high ressers"" eventually die off and their cult following dissipates.

What a self driving car does need is:

 - means of determining which surfaces are navigable (especially useful for flooding, toadworks, accident scenes)
 - means of estimating a route through navigable terrain
 - codification of road rules to clarify which navigable terrain is allowed under what circumstances
 - guesture recognition for emergency services and roadworks amongst other scenarios
 - overrides so passengers or remote supervisors can instruct the vehicle on where to go

There are tools such as polarimetric and non-visible-spectrum cameras which will be more useful than LiDAR for determining navigable terrain (i.e.: warning of water, ice, other hazards, detecting compressed and manufactured surfaces).

Then there is guesture recognition for things such as police manually signalling at controlled intersections, lollipop holders at roadworks, etc. LiDAR will not help with this.",1490066140,df7b5da,t3_60l2xj,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2017

By not using LiDAR Tesla have made the machine learning portion more difficult, which means all else being equal, they will go to the market later than if they uses LiDAR.

The thing is Tesla is forced to make this trade off since they want the current model S to be ""self-driving ready"", and there is no LiDAR solution cheap and small enough on the market yet.

You can have a self-driving car just by stereoscopic computer vision. But the goals are so vague, the rules and the size of the problem are so big that it will require massive amount of computation, learning that the progress of producing that car will be slowed.

Using LIDAR (and sonar for that matter) is to programmatically figure out certain problems and have the quick solution to it. Humans have a problem with [this situation](http://www.woostercollective.com/post/3d-optical-illusion-painted-on-street-to-make-drivers-slow-down).  A computer running with just computer vision has even a bigger problem. Just using sonar is a very easy solution.

So, what Apple would need to do is find a higher margin area of self driving car tech that they could reasonably improve upon and make more user friendly than anyone else. I could envision a fully integrated camera/sensor system that merges seamlessly with the entertainment system of the vehicle to provide visible feedback of the working sensors. But more importantly (and where money can be made) is to make the car a rolling entertainment center since you won't be driving. Build larger and more screens into cars, provide 4G connection, and have everything link up smoothly with your suite of Apple products.

151,ZorbaTHut,"&gt; Ownership is never going away

Sure, it's not going to go away entirely. But I suspect it'll get a lot less common. And if you don't like that answer, pick one of the alternates.

&gt; How can it drop you off if the road is no stopping?

Very few roads are. Even fewer food-heavy roads are. And it can always nose into the driveway to drop you off. (Or into the alley, since apparently there is one.)

&gt; See above. The lot is the only access. Now what?

First, the BBQ store is long since out of business.

Second, the worst-case scenario is that it drives past, notices that the lot is blocked off, and asks you for a new destination. You, being a human, can point it at the Jiffy-Lube lot.

It's not like stepping into a self-driving car requires you to instantly get a lobotomy.

&gt; No, actually, it has to be perfect when it comes to safety.

No, it doesn't. And it never will be. It is literally impossible; there will always be freak accidents that it can do nothing about.

&gt; Great, they know theres a gap between the buildings. The area beyond the gap is private property. How do they know where the alley leads, and who is allowed to use it? They can't see the lot from the road, nor can they understand if it is for customer use, employees, residents, etc.

""How do they know where the alley leads""?

Really?

Maybe it leads into a transdimensional pocket that goes to Zimbabwe! Or maybe it goes straight forward, and you can see whether it turns (it probably doesn't), and you can also see its path on Google Satellite, and also remember *you're talking about an alley that leads to a parking lot* so they can just drive down it and see where it goes, then back out.

And again, humans aren't stupid; it is entirely plausible to imagine a little interface that asks you which parking lot is usable. Even if we utterly ignore the fact that machine learning can quickly figure out which parking lots are considered acceptable, it's *still* good enough to just, y'know, ask the person sitting in the car.

Seriously: Stop looking for problems and start looking for solutions. I can come up with a billion ridiculous little special cases (""oh but what if there's a fly on the sensor"" ""what if it's really hot and the parking lot asphalt is shiny"" ""what if a cosmic ray hits the computer and flips a bit""), but each of these problems is solvable with only seconds of thought.

Next time you have an objection, think for, like, thirty seconds, and see if you can find a solution that's reasonably effective. Doesn't have to be perfect. Just has to be good enough.",1490639643,dfh8m3g,t1_dfh8515,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2017

154,Colossal_Caribou,"Uber is investment banking transplanted from New York to San Francisco. That being said, their self-driving operations run pretty autonomously from the parent company.

Depending on where you work, you'll really be entering those cultures, rather than Uber's culture.

Because of this, I wouldn't worry as much about the culture as I would if I were joining Uber proper.

Yes, my assumptions are indeed in the target market for self-driving cars. It would be pretty silly to choose a different target market.

&gt; AKA: fleet ownership will work in places that taxis are already viable - NYC, Chicago, DC. Omaha, Dallas, Memphis etc? Nope.

Meanwhile, Uber et al are cheerfully moving into all of those cities. Maybe they know something you don't know?

Now you click the little interface that says where to park, and it remembers for next time.

&gt; I now have to pick a new destination on a screen while speeding along because we can't stop.

So what? You're not driving, you're just using a screen. How long, exactly, is it going to take for a U-turn?

And next time it'll remember where the parking lot is. Hell, the place you're describing doesn't have an obvious place to park, and the system will know that in advance - it'd probably just ask you where to park before you leave. (Or on the way.)

Finally, ""a human would have handled this situation instantly""? You're describing a situation where it's impossible to stop on a road and there's only a small sign directing you to another parking lot. I have missed signs before when driving. Not all humans are going to get this perfectly right on the first try.

&gt; However, if a non-freak collision results in a fatality, the full liability falls on the billion dollar company, vs today where it falls on the driver and their $2,000 estate.

Companies deal with fatalities all the time. If rare fatalities destroyed billion-dollar industries, then we would have no mining, no logging, no manufacturing.

Did you know that office chairs are occasionally fatal? And yet office chairs still exist. You're drastically overestimating the corporate danger of the occasional injury.

No longer will it be acceptable to have a company's technicians pore over logs and provide an interpretation: it will be necessary for the cars to keep real time logs of what the interpretation of sensor data was, what stuff was seen that shouldn't be there, what wasn't seen that should have been there, the actions the SDC considered, which option was chosen and why.

To get into the track of producing SDC companies will start improving their driver assistance features — some will pursue the MobikEye route of integrating a third party with their vehicles, others will pursue their own designs. Driver assist will start with the features some luxury car marques are already providing: smart cruise control, self parking, and other convenience features.

Eventually these features will expand to take over the mundane driving tasks: driving from home to office and back on well marked roads with other traffic will become common soon (next 3 years).

Other features will be invented to take advantage of internet connected vehicles: if you want to arrive at 8:40, and it is currently 7:50, the car will plan a 50 minute route complete with holding patterns to get you to your destination as close to exactly 8:40 as possible. This will be one possible due to ""V2I"" being subsumed into the Internet, with traffic signals effectively publishing their schedule for the next ten to fifteen minutes, traffic counters providing real time updates of volumes, registries for cars to share route planning statistics (not actual route plans because those were used to kidnap the King of America's kids) etc, so the car will be able to predict to about twenty second accuracy the arrival time for any trip.

This route planning will be useful for manually operated vehicles too, regardless of the prevalence of SDC.

Another feature will emerge due to the gradual quietening of cars as they go electric and comfortable: beam forming microphones and the cameras required to use cars as mobile conference rooms. The passenger seats in minivans and large sedans will have ""office upgrade"" options to switch out the three person fold-flat back seat for comfortable executive lounge and conference facilities. Personal limousine services will come down a price bracket or two as people find that ""Netflix and chill"" is less intimate than ""Tesla and chill"".

Along with these will be ""feature detection"" aka ""pothole avoidance"" where cars being driven by humans will look for unexpected steering (swerves, biases towards one side of a lane) amongst users of a particular stretch of road then use that to adjust self driving cars on the same network, and perhaps even automatically report maintenance issues to the appropriate body.

While these features are arriving, SDC creators will be exploring heuristics for better driving: for example to stay in the middle lane of a three-lane carriageway in an urban environment where some on-street parking is allowed and intersections have no dedicated turning lanes.",1490767746,dfjrxqc,t3_61ywxb,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2017

To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised to find SDC creators combining add features such as boxing-in bad human drivers, or otherwise mitigating their bad driving habits (even to the point of filling the lanes so that overtaking becomes impossible). It might come to the point of SDCs automatically reporting erratic behaviour and the respective authorities tightening the road rules to start removing people's licences for ever more minor infractions:

 - failure to use an entry ramp correctly
 - slowing down before entering the exit ramp
 - tailgating
 - failure to indicate before turning

&gt; Uber is restarting tests of self-driving cars, three days after pausing the program following a crash of one of its vehicles.

&gt; A few weeks ago, AAA released survey results showing three out of four U.S. drivers are afraid to ride in a self-driving vehicle.

&gt; &amp;quot;What Americans may not realize is that the building blocks towards self-driving cars are already in today&amp;#039;s vehicles and the technology is constantly improving and well-trusted by those who have experienced it,&amp;quot; said John Nielsen, AAA&amp;#039;s managing director of automotive engineering and repair, in a statement.

185,Drogans,"Keep in mind, this isn't a criminal matter (yet), this is a only civil action.  

Pleading the fifth in a *civil* matter is extremely unusual, to say the least.

One has to suspect that the head of Uber's self driving division pleading the fifth wasn't anywhere on the agenda of Uber's army of lawyers.  His pleading the fifth seems unlikely to help Uber in any way.  In truth, it could do active damage to the company's prospects and ability to raise further rounds of investment.

This exercising of constitutional rights was likely to have been an action recommended by Levandowski's personal attorney.  It would not be surprising to learn that Uber's counsel vehemently opposed this plan, but given no other choice, went along.  

The other big fallout of today's festivities was the Judge's pronouncement that he is inclined to give Waymo the preliminary injunction they've asked for.

Yes, and the end could come as soon as a week from now.  

The judge suggested that if Levandowski continues to plead the fifth, he will grant Waymo's request for a preliminary injunction.

Once that happens, Uber will be forced to cease most or all work on their self driving program.  Their self driving talent will quickly abandon ship, and the investors who'd been promised self-drivng was Uber's path to profits may leave as well.

&gt; The blame is squarely on the left-turning Honda CRV driver who hit the Uber car. Demler said, “Legally, I understand that the CRV ‘failed to yield.’”

&gt; Fault or no fault, however, the Honda CRV driver “actually took more action to avoid the collision than did the Uber in self-driving mode,” Demler believes.

&gt; “It is totally careless and stupid to proceed at 38 mph through a blind intersection. The Volvo’s self-driving system failed to execute proper and safe driving behavior,” he added.  “We’ve all been there, but any human would know better.

192,Drogans,"&gt; Gonzalez [defense lawyer] suggested Uber's strategy would be to convince the court that Uber was ""not using any of these things"" Waymo says he stole.

Judge Alsup didn't seem convinced by that argument.  He indicated he's going to rule in favor of Waymo's injunctive request unless Levandowski produces the requested information.  Levandowski isn't simply an employee at Uber, he's the head of Uber's self driving program. (at least for now)

Even if Levandowski were to remove his plea, Uber would have a difficult time arguing they didn't use the stolen tech.  This because of the way in which Google learned of the theft.  In that, a Waymo supplier was tasked to make a product for Uber that was nearly identical to an existing Waymo product.

One imagines Alsup will want Uber to explain how the products were so nearly identical if Uber wasn't privy to Waymo's trade secrets.  Uber will be hamstrung in explaining this without Levandowski's help.

193,Drogans,"&gt; why aren't there a large number of competitors? 

Because both Uber and Lyft subsidize rider fees and driver pay.  They're selling the product under cost, and they're doing this with the large amounts of investor dollars they have.

A new entry would need to charge higher rates simply to break even.  Either that or raise large amounts of investor capital and play the subsidy game.

When self-driving ride sharing services get going, they should be able to compete at Uber and Lyft's rates while still earning a profit.  This is why Uber has been so focused on being the first to market with self driving taxis.",1490987457,dfnv69s,t1_dfnkkwc,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2017
194,jpflathead,"&gt; Understood, but Uber programmers need to learn that once and the ""next generation"" will know. It's a pretty costly lesson for each new generation of human drivers to learn things by totaling cars.

Well most important thing first, neither of our cars was totalled! After a dreadful month, my insurance company called me to tell me my pocket rocket was all fixed up!

*Understood, but Uber programmers need to learn that once and the ""next generation"" will know.*

That's not true for several reasons:

+ depends on testing and working against regression
+ depends on the nature of the fix. Did it fix a specific situation, or was it a general fix?

My very shallow understanding is that Google and Uber differ in self driving cars and testing: Google is making a car able to drive itself in *any* situation, Uber is making a car able to drive itself in specific situations in well mapped cities.

A fix might be narrow or broad. A narrow fix won't fix the problem when the car is in a similar, but different situation.

In the meantime, 

*It's a pretty costly lesson for each new generation of human drivers to learn things by totaling cars.*

It's one thing, and not a good thing, for me to learn how to drive through an intersection by t-boning a car and needlessly risking lives.

Neither route ends well for them.

&gt; According to a Google document filed in court yesterday, Levandowski created ""competing side businesses"" as early as 2012 while he was still working for Google. That's when Levandowski is said to have incorporated a company called Odin Wave LLC, with a physical address at a building he owned in Berkeley, California.

&gt; Odin Wave submitted an order to a hardware maker asking for a ""customer-fabricated part"" similar to what Google used in its self-driving cars. Google employees investigated Odin Wave, noted the connections to Levandowski, and questioned the engineer about it, but Levandowski denied having any ownership, according to Google lawyers.
&gt; Google claims Odin Wave later merged with another LLC called Tyto Lidar, which ultimately became part of Otto—Levandowski's startup that was later acquired by Uber for $680 million.

&gt; Levandowski not only started work on his competing self-driving car business while he still worked at Google, he tried to recruit more Googlers to join him, according to the filing. He worked together with a partner who also was at Google and whose name is redacted from the filings. However, as TechCrunch notes in its review of the new documents, the work history described matches that of Otto cofounder Lior Ron.",1491334039,dftux7b,t3_63gdjc,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2017
215,Drogans,"&gt; Odin Wave submitted an order to a hardware maker asking for a ""customer-fabricated part"" similar to what Google used in its self-driving cars. 

So Levandowski was caught twice in *exactly* the same way?  

The instance above occurred in 2013.  While he was working for Google, his secret company was reported to Google by a supplier when they noticed the Odin Wave components were strikingly similar to Google components.  

Then again, in late 2016, a Waymo supplier ""accidentally"" sent the plans for an Uber part to Waymo.  A part that was nearly identical to a Waymo part.  The 2016 component incident appears to have been the primary trigger for Waymo's devastating filing against Uber.

Given recent developments, investors in self-driving startups run by former Googlers need a guarantee that they're not buying into a company over which Google could assert complete ownership.  In dealing with those like Levandowski, a personal guarantee that lacked commensurate penalties would probably not be worth the paper it was printed on.

If the startup founders were willing to pledge their personal assets as a guarantee of their non-theft, the terms would certainly be enforceable. If they didn't steal tech from Google, they'd have nothing to worry about.  Any who were thieves of Google's IP would be unlikely to sign, protecting the investors.  

Neither side would ever expect or desire the clause to be executed.  It would simply act as a filter.

The first public road examples might run routes between specific drop-off points at airport terminals and nearby hotels, and those seem more likely in 2019 or 2020.

Regulations aren't nearly the impediment many suggest.  Localities across the western world are fighting each other to be the first to approve self driving cars for their roadways.

The massive ramifications of this point can hardly be understated.

Levandowski remains the head of Uber's self driving division to this very day.  Everything Levandowski touched could be considered fruit of the poisoned tree.  And when it comes to Uber's self driving program, Levandowski likely touched **everything**.

&gt; But we can pretty plainly see that they aren't using their lidar technology. 

The LiDAR is the eyes, not the brains.

The brains are the autonomous software stack.  If Uber is prohibited from using their self driving software stack, they're going to be set back to square one.

A settlement is often the way these cases end, but there are suggestions this isn't Alphabet's plan.

If all they wanted was a settlement, why not go there before filing suit? After all, Google Ventures has a large amount of equity in Uber.  They could also have filed a less damaging suit, holding back the more damning evidence in exchange for a settlement. 

No, these actions suggest Alphabet is out to see Levandowski in a jail cell and Uber in bankruptcy.  

Why?  Perhaps because Levandowski's theft was so outrageous and blatant that Alphabet felt they needed to send a message to all other former, or soon-to-be former Googlers.  

Also consider that Waymo's emerging business model would seem to make Uber their most direct competitor.  Uber has told their investors that self driving was the way Uber could *finally* sell their products at a profit.  If Uber has to start over in self driving, new investment will dry up, their self-driving workforce will leave, and Uber will no longer have the funds to continue the current level of ride and driver subsidy.

2) i could be wrong again (as i was above) but i don't see Germany ever (at least for the foreseeable future) allowing AI's to take full responsibility, leaving the human to tend to other matters. This is a huge deal as you are technically still required to be in the driver seat, paying full attention to traffic &amp; vehicle controls. 
Labor is very expensive in Germany so any business looking to create driverless delivery/taxi services etc. wont be able to proceed. Not to mention that ""owning"" a vehicle could be eradicated if vehicles were autonomous altogether. Everyone could be on a low-tier lease and just hit a button on their app to fetch an available vehicle. Lastly, the design of cars would be massively different if it no longer required a ""driver"" as you can imagine. 

All in all, its a nice move in the right direction but not a gamechanger. Aside from improved safety, what changes for the end-user? You still need to get/own a driver's license (which happens to be around 1.500 € to 2.000 € in Germany), own a vehicle, sit in the driver seat and be ready to take over the wheel at any moment, and find parking yourself.

258,Drogans,"&gt; I'm afraid the whole shitshow will slow down a lot of progress from both of these major players.

This case absolutely risks mortal damage to Uber's self driving ambitions, but Wamo's work will likely see no slowdown.

Waymo seems far more hamstrung by business problems than technical problems.  They need to figure out their go to market model and quickly execute upon it.

&gt; So all that is to say a shame Levandowski fucked up so royally and generally comes off as an asshole

Given his plea, the court could certainly prohibit him from doing any self driving work, for Uber or any other group.

&gt; suing Einstein for inventing the theory of relativity

Levandowski is no Einstein.  

The theory of relativity wasn't *work product* for the Swiss patent office.  Levandowski's self-driving efforts while working for Google's self driving division were work product.  

While at google, he started a secret self driving company.  When that company was found to have paid a Google supplier to make copies of Google's hardware, Levandowski was asked by Google if he owned the company, he lied that he did not.  He then reportedly conspired with Uber, while still employed with Google, to transfer Google's IP to Uber.  And of course, stole rafts of Google documents.

By the end of this case, Levandowski will be lucky if he still has a penny to his name and isn't occupying a jail cell.  Brilliant or not, his conduct has been ethically banrkupt at best, and feloniously criminal at worst.

259,polezo,"Lol, you shot down that Einstein comparison hard. I never said it was a perfect analogy, but the point of sharing it was to say that it's clear this guy contributed a lot to the field. I don't think that he's an Einstein, but that his contemporaries are willing to make that comparison shows he was pretty influential to say the least.

And all of that is not to defend him at all by the way. I think he likely fully deserves what's coming. Just commenting on the fact that many in the industry see him as one of the biggest pioneers, so if he ends up in jail or otherwise unable to work in the field for some time, it's not necessarily a small loss. 

&gt;Waymo seems far more hamstrung by business problems than technical problems. They need to figure out their go to market model and quickly execute upon it.

But that's the thing--they don't necessarily *want* to go fast to market. By nearly all accounts they want to have fully self-driving--sans steering wheel or anything else for the driver to take control, so the car has to be ready for *ANY scenario*--so that's why they're taking their time. Shit is just really fucking hard to account for weird driveways, rural roads and other situations. I agree that they're probably feeling more pressure to release something sooner now that there are so many more players, but I don't think they're going to deviate from the path of completely automated first, so it will likely be some time before they fully have their business model fleshed out.

That's also allegedly why Levandowski left--because he was frustrated by the fact they weren't going to bring something to market for years. He wanted to push for integrating systems into existing cars, and producing self driving cars and trucks that work in extremely well in specific scenarios and areas (but not necessarily everywhere). He went to Uber because Uber absolutely *has* to go fast to market. Their business model is barely sustainable without self-driving, so they are going to iterate as fast as they possibly can.",1491938800,dg4rx83,t1_dg4qith,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2017

Uber may have a different way of describing it, but it seems quite likely that they're going to get smacked down, hard.

Additionally, firing him could trigger a golden parachute, while removal by court order may not.  

Either way, it seems only a matter of time until Levandowski is removed from Uber.  Once that happens, it will be interesting to see if Uber immediately sues Levandowsk.  It may depend on how much Uber's executive staff knew of the alleged theft.

The answer to ""can we build a self driving car?"" is yes. They already exist and work. They just need more work and more data before they can be 100% trusted in every situation. 

The basic answer to most of your questions is that they have advanced sensors to detect everything going on around them, from moving cars, to parked cars, to cars driving erratically to pedestrians, trees, animals, etc. And they have sophisticated software that identifies those things and knows how to react (keep driving, slow down, stop, turn, etc) 

Also regarding something being broken: there are other ways to detect whether a system is broken or not besides physically looking at it.

The question I have is how much better than a human we're going to expect it to be before it feels ""acceptable."" Machines also have access to other spectrums like infrared and night vision, and can look in all directions at once.

&gt; But that is interesting now that I think about it. How would empty cars know what to do in an unpredictable situation such as a traffic jam? People make mistakes, so what will it do? Someone fucks up on the road, what will it do?

Not sure, but the more self driving cars there are, the more they can network to keep each other safe and stay up to date with traffic data.

&gt; There's construction on the road or some other anomaly.
Road construction often has police cars at the front end of things, so some kind of signal could be included as part of standard issue for highway patrol cars in addition to whatever other safeguards the vehicle in question has.

&gt; Police sirens? Can they detect that.
My phone can listen to pretty much any song on the radio and tell me what it is in a few seconds using Shazam, which came out in 2008, and current text to speech engines are also fairly accurate these days. Compared to that, a consistent sound like a siren should be a cakewalk.

&gt; What do they do if a lot of parked spots are taken, will they know to park at a different spot?
I expect having my car drop me of at my destination then sending it off to go find street parking is going to be a pretty normal thing. They may need to update parking meters to communicate wirelessly, but if you don't need to be near your car anymore then there isn't as much of a need for them to keep people moving along anyways.

One opportunity created by self-driving will be the ability to *reduce* the speed limit on side streets to something more reasonable (15-30kph).

In the short term, there will be very little change in road infrastructure as human drivers will continue to need lines and  signs (most of that data will come to SDs digitally).  I believe that the first change will be dedicated SD lanes either supplementing or replacing HOV lanes.  There will need to be some improvement in the way that road work, detours and closures are indicated.  Some roads and situations that are specifically dangerous by design will become apparent as the statistical signal emerges from the noise of human error.

352,palthainon,"* Fewer parking lots - People are fine with uber and lift so it only stands to reason that self driving cars will bring that cost down much more, reducing the need to buy and park a car. Perhaps using subscription models along with pay per trip. Parking lots in down town areas are valuable real estate, it'll just require cities to remove parking minimums, which is happening anyway.
* Drop off points will become far more crucial to retail stores.
* Bus stops may get amped up as it becomes possible to run many smaller buses that go all different directions. Key routes will become more like metros as it becomes more common to travel to large car than metro trains (this is more of a guess, but its nice to think of)
* Bikes and pedestrians could be treated either way: 100% response from vehicles means that being a vulnerable road user elevates you to dictator of what all cars do. There may be heavier fines for jaywalking but crossing streets will be infinitely safer. Or perhaps cars will be more often routed away from side streets giving more room for vulnerable road users to exist without the threat of cars. Perhaps more of the lanes can be reclaimed for bikes, mopeds, and pedestrians since traffic can be managed more easily. (Delay/slow down key vehicles for 2 minutes to reduce traffic  that normally goes on for hours)
*  Fewer road signs. Road signs are for people and the transition to full automation means the vehicle will already know where every road goes for the next few hundred miles or so.
* Lanes can be digital - you don't need to paint lines if the cars know exactly how much space they need and what part of it they need to take up. Road paint may become redundant on highways.
* No more speed bumps
* Congestion pricing - this won't be visible in the traditional sense but it is a tool to reduce traffic now.

358,jaxbotme,"I'll chime in a bit. I've always been against what Tesla is doing, because it feels like they're trying to invent the cell phone before we invent the PC. Meaning, what they are doing is technically possible, but the people with the biggest budgets, the best equipment, and the best researchers haven't cracked the problem, so I'm skeptical that they can do so with less tech and lower budgets (Tesla isn't over the hump yet where they could spend fuck-you money keeping engineers on the project, like Waymo allegedly did).

I think what they are doing is technically possible, and could be the future. But when we haven't even cracked the AI part of this, it seems silly to be trying to do more with less. Also, LIDAR is useful for more than just classifying objects. It's used for localization when GPS fails, down to the exact lane. It gives you instant velocity readings by angle, so there's no guessing based on stereo camera feeds how fast an object is moving, or how trying to find stationary objects with radar. It's a useful sensor in a larger sensor suite.

As for what Tesla is currently doing...

&gt;Also, Tesla is already taking people's money ($3,000) for ""full self-driving capability"".

No way, not going to happen. They might make a car that can drive 90% of the time and throw back to the driver otherwise (and we know there's a schism about whether that's a good idea), but it's simply *not possible* to make an L4 with what they have, in my opinion. Here's why:

- No rear radar. It is not possible to make a lane change safely if there's a large speed differential between your car and the approaching car, and while I guess you could guess the speed using the stereo cameras, I'm skeptical that would work at long distances and high velocities.
- No side radar -- same issue, but take a right from a stop sign onto a aertial road.
- No color vision except red -- so there's no way of knowing if something is a blinking yellow.
- Afaik (correct if wrong) no microphone array, so no chance of detecting sirens
- And everything you mentioned about mapping

So yeah, I think it's reasonable to be skeptical about AP2 ever being 'fully autonomous'. I think we need to know what Tesla meant by that term and what they're really promising. It's definitely not L4.",1493334332,dgue0by,t3_67ydqz,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2017

361,glbeaty,"Yeah, Tesla's R&amp;D expenditures for 2016 were $834M, with presumably only a fraction of that going towards self-driving tech. I don't know what Waymo's budget is, but Google spent $3.5B on its moonshots in 2015. In 2016 this dropped to $1.9B. I'd certainly hope self-driving consumed more of this than the other ~~loser projects~~ moonshots. It famously paid some Waymo employees ""fuck you money"".

Though Mobileye's R&amp;D only cost them $65M in 2016, and they got bought out for $15B. So it seems possible Tesla could be employing Mobileye-caliber people, though if so I'd suspect most would rather strike out on their own than work for peanuts at a larger company (hence Waymo's salaries). Just like medical scientists with hot new drugs tend to start new companies where they can potentially rake in hundreds of millions or billions.

But there was this one anecdote:

&gt;One of the first major public investments in self-driving technology came in 1991 when Congress passed the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). That law authorized $650 million to develop technology necessary for driverless cars to operate on an automated highway. The early renderings of a driverless system imagined “smart infrastructure”, with roadways and vehicles outfitted with sensors and hardware that would guide an automobile along a programmed path. The culmination of this endeavor was a 1997 demonstration of a vehicle test fleet with operators not using hands or feet driving 7.6 miles of Interstate 15 in San Diego.

395,try_not_to_hate,"I don't believe either of those points are true.    
  
first, the 81c per mile is the lowest estimate I found.  MassDOT puts bus maintenance cost at $3.45-$12.42 per mile (I've seen higher).  even if we take the absolute best case scenario, at 0.81c/mi, that's still two SDC transit vans per 100kmi.  if you consider the low end of the mass-DOT numbers (which is a real number, from a real municipality) you get 8 transit vans (more capacity than the bus).  you also have to consider that a bus does not go 1Mmi without major overhauls, which are expensive.  you're also forgetting the higher efficiency of a SDC taxi, they don't have to make every stop, only the necessary stops.  
  
  
for the second point, there are absolutely cars that drive all day.  Taxis, delivery vans, etc. on top of that, SDCs would not need to drive all day.  you would only have all vehicles deployed at peak times, and would rotate the rest of the time.  
  
  
so, you can buy 18 passenger vans for the cost of a bus, approximately 5 times the total capacity of a bus.  on top of that, every 100k miles, the bus costs you enough buy 8-30 new passenger vans.  that's 3-12 times the capacity of a bus. so, both initial cost and maintenance cost come out ahead for self driving cars/vans vs buses

396,Drogans,"Imagine all the vehicles taking commuters into a city in the morning, then needing to return to the city center each evening, riderless, to pick up the city workers and drive them home.

Current city commuters take public transit or leave their vehicles parked in the city.  Self driving vehicle owners won't want or need to pay expensive, city parking fees.  The cars will be able to drive themselves to previously inconvenient, but cheap parking to await the afternoon return trip.  Additionally, some small proportion of the commuting vehicles will circulate the city during the day taking riders to and fro.

The congestion as these vehicles arrive and depart cities each morning and evening could easily be worse than current traffic.  The rush will happen in both directions.   This will be enhanced by the likelihood that self driving carpools could be far superior to existing public transit.  Self driving carpools or mini buses will not require riders travel to reach a station, and could even be cheaper.  Self driving vehicles will pick up riders at the doors of their homes, and drop them at the front door of their workplace.

TLDR - Musk is probably right.  Self driving cars stand to be cheaper, safer, and be far more convenient than mass transit.  The downside is that it will necessarily increase congestion.  ",1493767047,dh1v3np,t3_68qnz1,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2017

But aside from strict technological aspects the transition to fully autonomous, road ways if ever completely done, will likely succeed faster and smooth as a gradient transition.

A self driving mode allows people to activate the system for commutes but maintain the freedom to take control for casual drives or any reason. Not ideal but a product more likely to reach a wider audience sooner.  The more people it reaches early the more young people get acustom to the idea and potentially view human driving as a hassle.  In any case like being less interested in driving than the generation before them.

Seperately car insurance companies offer discounts based on perxentage of drive time spent in autonomous mode.  This can be monitored similar to progressive safe driver devices.  This gets people choosing the self driving mode more freely for personal gain.

Other industries with strong unions like public buses may be much slower for political reasons. Delivery drivers that do the unloading and even shelving and manual inventory may not make sense economically until very nimble robotic workers. 

Other than very high end the family car may be the slowest to transition. There are significant extra costs and the infrastructure to maintain delicate sensors.

&gt; We have level-two self-driving cars. They can drive on the highway, follow the white lines on the highway, and there’s really no need for any person to be seated and controlling any of the instruments.

The only thing that requires a human to be available for long stretches of select roadways is the law, not the technology.

This 'brain' can then be calibrated to operate on most any vehicle platform - as the essential driving task of 'don't hit anything, follow the rules and be safe' is the same for any vehicle operating in the public realm.

So with Uber facing business disruption if they don't have autonomous vehicles first, then the acquisition of Otto made sense, as the 'brain' tech could be translated onto their principle business stream ( taxi-like vehicles). Any LiDAR tech would probably have been icing on the cake.

So I am not overly surprised that the trucking side might not be being pushed aggressively, as the development of the 'brain' tech will initially be used where it is needed most - on the taxi-like vehicles. It also happens to be easier to get the maximum deep learning benefits from a large fleet of vehicles which is much more cost-effective with smaller vehicles. But once the 'brain' has been sufficiently developed it can be re-calibrated for other vehicle platforms, like trucks, when needed at a later date.

This is not news. 

After the mass layoffs, it was clear they were abandoning self-made vehicles in favor of a self-driving software / hardware platform to be offered directly to vehicle makers.

Had Apple made their own vehicles, it would have put them in direct competition will each and every one of the world's auto makers.  In response, the auto makers would have been strongly disincentived from allowing Apple devices or services any level of integration.  Even had Apple managed to grab 5% of the vehicle market, they'd have locked Apple services and device integration out of the remaining 95%. 

While Apple could likely have managed the technical challenge of building their own car, from a business perspective, it was hubris for Apple to have even considered it.

Prior to Apple's change of direction, Waymo had already adopted the platform sales model - and likely for the same reasons.   Had Google / Alphabet / Waymo manufactured their own vehicles, they would also have risked auto maker exile, a scenario that advertising-reliant Google could even less afford than Apple.

Not sure which FP is apporpriate

These are expensive though
&gt; The V100 will first appear inside Nvidia's bespoke compute servers. Eight of them will come packed inside the $150,000 (~£150,000) DGX-1 rack-mounted server, which ships in the third quarter of 2017. A 250W PCIe slot version of the V100 is also in the works (probably priced at around £10,000), as well as a half-height 150W card that's likely to feature a lower clock speed and disabled cores.

A typical current LIDAR spins at 10Hz, which means that it could be 100ms between the object appearing within range, and the object being perceived for the first time.

Given that the laser returns are often noisy, computer probably needs at least 2 spins to be reasonably sure there is something really there and start braking (braking when you aren't sure makes for a very unpleasant ""scaredy cat"" ride).

Let's dissect a frame of an intersection, randomly taken by dropping a street view pin into LA: https://i.imgur.com/A7Y21co.jpg

This scene to us is fairly mundane, but to a computer this scene is very complicated, especially with only cameras. The first really hard thing is this bus. If you look closely you'll see there are red stop lights reflecting in the windows. We as humans know naturally how reflections work, and that the people and the stop lights in that bus window aren't real. We don't need to treat any of that info as semantic info in our scene. However, we **do** know that bus is real, and we can't go hitting it. 

This scene also has other complicated visuals. Construction that we as humans understand means the lane isn't open. That bike parked in the corner doesn't have a person on it and thus won't ride into our lane. Computers aren't as good at reasoning like this. They don't have an understanding of the natural world, and don't know the obvious ""oh that's a reflection not a red light"". Of course you could probably create a system that fixes each exact issue, but there are 1000 more issues like this that could come up. 

These semantic understanding issues can be fixed by using multiple sensors: Lidar would show the bus there, and not the pedestrians reflecting. This allows the system to treat the object as a bus even without understanding reflections. Radar gives us yet another tool for sensing the world, and again we can use it when we're not sure of another input. This is why people think Tesla is taking such a difficult route towards self driving, and why most major players are using many types of sensing.

It's worth noting that monocular distance estimation is an [active research area.](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5539-depth-map-prediction-from-a-single-image-using-a-multi-scale-deep-network.pdf) However, it's still inaccurate in many cases, and worse it's not well understood when the network will be wrong. This means for a safety critical system, people are understandably wary.

TL;DR The reason we can drive with our close together eyes is that we're wicked smart and comprehend a ton of things about the real world that computers aren't close to understanding.",1519976084,dv27v2b,t1_dv1134q,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2018

Quick definition from SAE:

&gt;	Level 3 (”eyes off”): The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a movie. The vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response, like emergency braking. The driver must still be prepared to intervene within some limited time, specified by the manufacturer, when called upon by the vehicle to do so. 

So pretty much as you just said, though just like you pointed out in your last paragraph, the system still needs driver's attention.

Not paying attention is really the goal of L4 and it's main difference factor (Hence the nickname ""Mind off""):

&gt;	Level 4 (”mind off”): As level 3, but no driver attention is ever required for safety [...] self driving is supported only in limited areas (geofenced) or under special circumstances, like traffic jams. Outside of these areas or circumstances, the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip, i.e. park the car, if the driver does not retake control.

&gt; Regardless of its hopes for a Waymo deal, Uber has an end-of-year internal goal for its own program of letting customers in the Phoenix area ride in Uber’s own autonomous vehicles with no person sitting behind the wheel—known as a “safety driver”—to take over in case of a problem, according to a person familiar with the goal. Uber wants to offer these rides using its Volvo car prototypes. The rides would be limited to certain routes in good weather, this person said.

&gt; But even if Uber succeeds, it will be behind Waymo, which has been testing such rides in Phoenix since last fall. Waymo is developing a robotaxi service in Phoenix in which customers hail a ride through Waymo’s app. The Phoenix suburbs are popular for self-driving car tests because they have a relatively simple grid-like street layout, good weather and friendlier regulations than California and some other areas of the U.S.",1520282763,dv8b9pt,t3_82860m,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2018

I agree with the statement, but don't see how that is relevant.

It's far easier to install control systems into a vehicle that by necessity, already has electronic control of all braking and acceleration.  Hybrids and electrics have this, most ICE do not.

It's likely that Waymo and the rest would have abandoned ICE entirely if there were greater availability of full battery electric vehicles.

Anyway i found [one of the articles](https://medium.com/@johnzimmer/the-third-transportation-revolution-27860f05fa91) I based my comments off of. He's a Lyft co-founder, so obviously there would be some bias there, but I think his points are solid:

&gt;Once this happens — once autonomous networks provide better service at a lower cost — our country will pass a tipping point. And by 2025, owning a car will go the way of the DVD. Until then, over the next five to 10 years there will be both driver and driverless cars on the road, which we call a hybrid network.


&gt;We are currently in the first of three phases, and will be until vehicles can be operated without any human intervention. That said, we don’t have to wait until autonomous cars are capable of handling all kinds of rides without human intervention. The second, or hybrid, period will be defined by a mix of limited capability autonomous vehicles operating alongside human-driven ones. At first, fully autonomous cars will have a long list of restrictions. They will only travel at low speeds, they will avoid certain weather conditions, and there will be specific intersections and roads that they will need to navigate around. As technology improves, these cars will be able to drive themselves in more and more situations. Hypothetically, Lyft could initially have a fleet of autonomous cars that completes rides under 25 miles per hour on flat, dry roads. Then, we could upgrade the fleet to handle rides under those same conditions, but at 35 miles per hour. And so on and so on, until every kind of trip can be completed by an autonomous car.

&gt;Some people assume that the introduction of autonomous vehicles will mean human drivers are no longer needed. **We believe that in the first five or more years following the introduction of autonomous vehicles, the need for human drivers will actually increase, not decrease**. How is that possible? Rides in autonomous vehicles will be less expensive than any options today and will lead to more people using Lyft for more and more of their transportation needs. As people rely on Lyft for more of their transportation, they are more likely to live car-free. And as more people trade their keys for Lyft, the overall market will grow dramatically. When autonomous cars can only solve a portion of those trips, more Lyft drivers will be needed to provide service to the growing market of former car owners.

&gt;Remember when cell phone coverage transitioned from 3G to 4G? The 4G networks were slowly rolled out, first covering only the largest cities and eventually growing to cover larger and larger portions of suburban areas. This ensures that people are always covered, one way or another. If you spend most of your time in a place that’s only covered by 3G or even 2G, you still have a network to rely on. But as soon as you step into a spot with 4G coverage, you automatically get to try it. Just wait for the upcoming launch of 5G. Future 5G networks won’t be introduced to the world by new companies, they will be rolled out on top of the largest existing networks around the world.


&gt;The introduction of autonomous vehicles will follow the same pattern, and will be the only way passengers are always covered. Safety is paramount, so any condition which remotely adds risk can be serviced through a hybrid network while the technology improves. If it’s snowing or raining we can turn off autonomous mode — and still pick you up. But all of this happens behind the scenes. For the passenger, autonomous will just be another mode of transportation. And no matter where you want to go, you’ll be able to enjoy safe and reliable service from Lyft.


So ya, obviously there's bias there, but I think he paints the most realistic vision for the transition period into a world of self-driving cars, taking into consideration the limitations of the technology and other pragmatic concerns. ",1520361892,dva25kq,t1_dva01sk,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2018

 An even smaller subset of ICE vehicles have steering that can be controlled by the ECU, this largely in vehicles with automated driver assistance systems.

Driver assistance systems like auto-braking, lane holding, and auto-swerving are growing in popularity, but today, are present in only a small subset of vehicles. 

These driver assistance technologies will become ever more common, perhaps a majority of new vehicles will have the technology in five years time.  But that's too late.

Here's the thing.  Not in the industry myself, but have had many conversations with those who are.  They tell me they're using hybrids because they are *far* easier to integrate into their self-driving stacks.

Functionality isn't affected by this, but yes. I don't really know about the smallest ones with just a couple cars, but companies like Tesla, Uber, Apple, Google and many others (even Shell) publicly announced that they'll ignore Trump's decision to exit the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. They all announced that they'll be investing shitloads of money into clean transportation. It kind of makes sense that they're sticking with hybrids and electric cars just for that reason. The future is electric, so why use ICE cars when your final production model will be electric?

&gt;They tell me they're using hybrids because they are far easier to integrate into their self-driving stacks.

Either you are lying, or they are. [Here](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/28/17061360/huawei-mate-10-pro-ai-self-driving-porsche-mwc-2018) is a simple tech demo where a standard ICE production car is being driven by a standard production smartphone. And it frikkin works! Imagine how well it would work with a real computer instead of a simple smartphone. 

&gt;Could a George Hotz style hack-a-car abuse the ABS and cruise control systems to create a dodgy, unreliable, mess of a self driving car?

He's a smart kid, so it's possible that he could come up with something functional, not dodgy at all. He probably won't make it sooner than a billion dollar company like Tesla, but then again, he's working on his own out of his garage and he already has something that kind of works. 

That's because you have just two things that you need to control: speed and angle. There's no sort of magic wizardry involved when you press the accelerator. There's no reason why it would be any different in a hybrid. I mean, hybrids use ICE engines to spin the wheels too, just like normal ICE cars.

Such a device could be used on sensors for autonomous cars to improve vision, by converting infrared light into visible light and allowing better vision in fog and darkness.

&gt; In addition, infrared sensors are not affected by sunlight, something that confuses today’s regular sensors.

&gt; An infrared sensor costs around $3,000, Sarusi said. A regular vision sensor used by autonomous cars costs $1-$2. So, by adding the nanotech layers, which cost around $5, Sarusi said, one can get an infrared sensor for about $7-$8.

&gt; “This technology will enable the creation of low-cost, down-to-earth IR sensors that can be used in mass production,” he said.

&gt; “This is a revolution because for autonomous cars, costs are important,” Sarusi said at a press briefing with journalists last week. Sensors are an essential component of self-driving cars, he said, and they need to be inexpensive.

&gt;I didn't realize you were suggesting banning them. How about this, motorcycles need to exist because have this thing called ""freedom"" where things aren't outlawed just because they don't conveniently fit into your idea of how thing should be.

There are endless limitations and rules governing what vehicles are street legal today. Freedom never has been and never will be absolute. If, as I suspect, at some point society finds there are enough advantages to allowing exclusively self driving vehicles on public roads then it will likely happen. And if enough people want to buy self driving motorcycles then somebody will make them, although that sounds like a nightmare to me.

If you want to be against that, that's fine, but there's no need to invent dubious technological reasons it can't happen. Just say you're against the idea on its merits. As long as enough people agree with you you'll be fine. 

&gt; SDCs are supposed to give us more freedom not less and if your only solution to problems is to take away existing options, you really don't deserve a place in the conversation.

I personally want self driving cars to succeed, but I'm uncomfortable participating in an experiment where the researchers have both a poor understanding of the risk, and use semantic loopholes to shift blame to operators whom they know will not or cannot be trusted to understand the limitations of the system. In liability a foreseeable misuse (even despite warnings in a manual) is still on the producer of the system. If even a small number of Tesla users think the vehicle is autonomous and can operate it as though it is, incidents should be the responsibility of the manufacturer, and such incidents should be classified as a failure of the autonomous vehicle. If Tesla etc do not want the incidents classified as such then they should be able to detect and prevent such use, or remove the system. ",1521500173,dvys3sv,t1_dvydmch,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2018

145,PetorianBlue,"&gt; I wonder how many statistically would have been hit if there were humans behind the wheel all those hours.

But...There were humans behind the wheel all those hours.  The safety driver.

So maybe a better question is, ""I wonder how many would have been hit if the safety driver wasn't there to prevent it.""  People like to say that ""autonomous cars"" have driven X million miles without a death.  But that's dishonest.  First of all, they're not including the Tesla deaths; which may more may not be justified based on the semantics of what a ""real"" self driving car is.  But also, they're cherry picking the good results.  Because all those cars had safety drivers that would take over when anything went wrong.  They are by definition only counting the miles where the car *didn't* fail.  That's 100% biased.  It's like saying you can sink 100 half court shots in a row as long as you don't count the shots where you missed.  It kinda makes no sense.

Again, it's a question of semantics, but I would say that until recently there have been 0 autonomous miles driven.

Only Waymo has an autonomous car running on public roads without a safety driver, and that just started so we have essentially zero data.",1521554542,dvzs356,t1_dvyaclv,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2018
146,PetorianBlue,"&gt; One death in ~~years~~ millions of km's! The technology has proved itself.

I really don't think that's fair at all.  I've said it before in a few places, so I'll just take bits of those comments...

There were humans behind the wheel for just about every single one of those kilometers.  People like to say that ""autonomous cars"" have driven X million miles without a death, but that's a really dishonest way to state the data.  First of all, you're not including the Tesla deaths; which may more may not be justified based on the semantics of what a ""real"" self driving car is.  But ignoring that for now, you're still cherry picking the good results.  Because all those cars had safety drivers that would take over when anything went wrong.  So you are only counting the miles where the car *didn't* fail.  That is biased.  You're tallying up all the good miles and presenting it in a way like those were the *only* miles.  It's like saying you can sink 100 half court shots in a row as long as you don't count the shots where you missed.  It kinda makes no sense.  Who knows how many people would have been run over if the human driver hadn't saved the day.

Again, it's a question of semantics, but I would say that until recently there have been **0** clean autonomous miles driven.  In order to really know how well an autonomous system performs, you have to be able to operate without a human catching all your mistakes.  Only Waymo has an autonomous car running on public roads without a safety driver, and that just started so we have essentially zero clean data.  All the other millions of miles, while they're not worthless in terms of showing that SDC's have potential, they are tainted and worthless in terms of saying how often SDC's kill people.

And a final note, even if everything I just said is complete bullshit, given that humans kill humans at a rate of about 1 per 100 million miles, ignoring the details of the ""quality"" of those miles, we are still nowhere near statistically significant to say ""the technology has proved itself"" if the barrier for proof is being as good or better than humans.",1521556095,dvztkrp,t1_dvy93eo,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2018

149,xcballer28,"Thanks, I try to only hop in when other people are staying calm, and I liked your points. 

I agree, that Uber does not have a good ""product"", but they do have a product. The reason I think the distinction is important, is because in the world of cars, there is never going to be a car, human driven or software driven that has a zero fatality rate. That's just not something I see happening in even the mid-distant future. And it is important to make distinctions like this when we are talking about what is ""good enough"" for testing, or commercial availability, or laws. We need clear lines that differentiate where and when different companies can operate.

So the difference between a bad toaster and a good toaster and a working toaster is important.

If a toaster toasts my bread, but also occasionally burns my house down, then it is working as intended sometimes and not as intended sometimes. And is also an absolutely horrible product that should come with warnings and regulations. It is a bad toaster.

If a toaster always burns my toast but never burns my house down, it is Never working as intended. It is safe, and in a lot of ways better than my house burning down, but it is a non working toaster. One might even not want to call it a toaster. It doesn't toast bread, so why would I call it a toaster? 

So if the Tesla isn't an autonomous car, and never claimed to be an autonomous car (horrible naming ""auto""pilot aside) it should not be counted in autonomous car fatalities. The reason this matters is because laws are going to be written for autonomous cars based on what people define ""autonomous car"" as. 

If you don't want to see the difference between tesla and uber because you want to say ""both tesla and uber need to be more careful with how they deploy untested technology"", that is fine and I agree with you.

But if you want to write laws governing how ""self driving cars"" should act or be liable in the future I think there is a very important distinction. One is a toaster that may or may not burn your house down and one is a ... ""paperweight that looks like a toaster?"" that may or may not burn your house down.",1521567182,dw05om6,t1_dvzqm51,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2018

151,madcuzimflagrant,"SHANGHAI—Chinese technology giants Baidu Inc., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings —dominant forces in e-commerce, mobile payments and social media—now are elbowing their way into autos, threatening established car makers.

These three companies—the so-called BATs—are plowing millions of dollars into electric-vehicle startups, car-sharing services and online retailers, as well as software platforms for autonomous driving and online car selling.

U.S. tech companies, notably Alphabet Inc. and its self-driving car unit Waymo, also are pushing into the auto sector. But the BAT companies have a big advantage in China, where tight government internet controls make it difficult for foreign enterprises to compete. For example, non-Chinese companies aren’t allowed to operate digital mapping systems needed for autonomous driving.

BAT-Mobiles
Chinese tech giants Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent have become major players in the auto business. Their interests span from electric-vehicle startups to smartcar software and online retail channels.  [There's an interactive graphic here]


That has prompted both foreign and domestic auto companies like Ford Motor Co. , BMW AG , SAIC Motor Corp. and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. to seal tech partnerships with the BAT firms. This month, Renault SA said it is aiming for a fivefold increase in Chinese sales by 2023 as the result of a deal to sell cars on Alibaba’s online retail platforms. Renault also said it would start using Alibaba’s connectivity software in its cars in China.

The threat posed by China’s internet giants was underscored when Li Shufu, the founder of Zhejiang Geely, announced last month that the company would invest $9 billion in a 9.7% stake in Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler AG .

“The competitors that challenge the global car industry in the 21st century technologically are not part of the automotive industry today,” Mr. Li said in a statement. “No current car industry player will be able to win this battle against the invaders from outside independently.”

Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent are betting that the auto industry is going to shift from selling hardware to selling services, with revenues derived mainly from selling subscriptions to features like shared autonomous vehicles and high-speed mobile internet.

“The BATs want people in cars using their online services. They see mobility as an on-ramp into their ecosystems,” said Bill Russo, an ex-Chrysler executive who now runs Shanghai consultancy Automobility. “So they’re all actively investing in mobility... This is a game that’s not happening anywhere else. It’s what makes China so unique.”

Baidu Chief Executive Robin Li has made developing self-driving cars a priority for the search and mapping company. “In future commutes, you won’t have to focus much on driving anymore,” he said, on the sidelines of China’s annual legislative session in Beijing this week. “You’ll be able to have hot pot and sing karaoke on the ride.”

Off the Map: The Rough Road Ahead for Self-Driving Cars in China
Chen Hong, chairman of SAIC Motor, China’s biggest car maker, speaking separately at the legislative session, acknowledged the tech giants’ threat but said traditional auto makers have an edge in understanding drivers and their needs.

Still, these auto makers need partners. SAIC has launched an internet-connected car powered by AliOS, Alibaba’s in-car operating system. Two big state-run car makers, Beijing Auto and Guangzhou Auto, are developing similar so-called smartcars with Baidu and Tencent respectively. Last year, Ford and BMW both said they, too, would launch smartcars using Alibaba’s software.

The BATs are also generously bankrolling startups that are making smartcars slated to hit the China market later this year.

Alibaba-backed startup Xpeng Motor’s new G3 SUV comes loaded with maps, music apps, Mandarin voice recognition and even a camera mounted on the roof, for buyers looking to post their travels on social media. Alibaba’s technology and its knowledge of the consumer, accrued over nearly two decades as China’s biggest e-commerce player, is helping Xpeng develop and grow quickly, said founder Xiaopeng He.

Traditional car makers need the BATs’ strategic insights in a fast-changing marketplace, said Freeman Shen, whose electric-vehicle startup WM Motor is backed by Baidu and Tencent. Unless auto makers work with the BATs, said Mr. Shen, a former Geely executive, “I don’t think they can survive.”

Baidu and Tencent are also investors in Shanghai-based NIO, whose debut electric vehicle has a voice-operated personal assistant, is able to park itself and comes loaded with apps provided by its two big tech backers.

The automobile is turning into a “mobile living space,” said NIO founder William Li. The passenger is a captive audience for internet services—hence the BATs’ interest in autos as potential channels for everything from online shopping to videogames to mobile TV.

All three companies have also invested in Didi Chuxing, China’s answer to Uber. And Tencent, hedging its bets beyond China, last year bought 5% of Tesla Inc . for $1.78 billion.

For now, auto makers and tech companies can coexist by marrying car-making expertise with software innovation. “When you put these two together you get a fantastic chemical reaction,” said Simon Hu, who runs Alibaba’s AliOS car operating-system division.

But as China’s tech giants permeate the auto industry from all angles, the big question is: How much of the sector’s revenues will they manage to commandeer? “The BATs have the bucks required to get into this game and stay in the game for however long it takes to win,” said Michael Dunne, a Hong Kong-based auto consultant.",1521573056,dw0cary,t1_dw07ovq,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2018

&gt;By Leslie Scism
&gt;Updated March 21, 2018 5:42 a.m. ET
&gt;As federal investigators begin to examine a pedestrian fatality involving a self-driving Uber Technologies Inc. car this week, America’s car insurers are watching closely.

&gt;Car insurers haul in roughly $230 billion of premiums a year, but much of that intake could evaporate in coming decades, say some consultants, assuming crucial breakthroughs in driverless technology that would eliminate the many wrecks caused by human error.

&gt;The potential hit to their bottom lines has property-casualty insurers in an arms race to figure out how they can design policies and price the risk of the vehicles that technology firms, such as Uber and Alphabet Inc., GOOGL +0.14% are seeking to deploy in huge numbers, according to industry brokers, executives and trade groups.

&gt;It isn’t clear that the death this week in Arizona would be an example of how liability would shake out for the industry. A person familiar with Uber said the firm’s test vehicles are insured through a commercial-insurance policy for a maximum of $5 million per accident. The insurer or insurers couldn’t immediately be learned.

&gt;The Uber accident highlights a likely broader trend to come in driverless cars. Under the current arrangement, individual car owners must buy liability policies to help cover damage in wrecks they cause. But in a possible metamorphosis, individuals would bear less financial responsibility.

&gt;Instead, the makers of the vehicles and their many complex parts will instead assume a bigger share—via product-liability coverage, consultants say.

&gt;“They are competitors, so understandably they often don’t talk publicly about this, but we do know insurance companies are engaged with developers, trying to help them reduce their liability exposure,” said Jim Whittle, associate general counsel for the American Insurance Association, a lobbying group representing some of the nation’s biggest property-casualty insurers.

&gt;Those possibly at fault for accidents: vehicle owners, manufacturers, suppliers, service providers and even data providers.

&gt;The shift from personal liability is also an opportunity for many of the nation’s biggest insurers eager to get in on the action of insuring autonomous vehicles.

&gt;“While insurance coverage for (autonomous vehicles) is not mainstream, there are companies that will provide policies,” said Maureen Brown, a vice president with Munich Reinsurance America Inc.

&gt;Munich Re does insure some “entities that are researching, testing, or developing hardware or software designed to move autonomous vehicle technology forward,” according to the firm.

&gt;As control of vehicles gradually moves from people to computers, exactly how the liability will shift remains to be determined, insurance brokers say. Uncertainties abound as to how autonomous vehicles will perform on roads with manually operated vehicles, among other things.

&gt;To test vehicles in any state, Uber and its rivals must meet financial-responsibility laws that obligate all car owners  to carry insurance. States require the coverage so that money is available to pay damage to victims of car accidents.

&gt;In Arizona, the minimum is $15,000 per person and $30,000 per accident.

&gt;Those minimums are far below what many people actually carry, set low partly to help encourage insurance purchases. When it comes to deep-pocketed corporate owners of vehicles, victims could sue for greater sums.

&gt;Indeed, should autonomous cars proliferate and if their safety record isn’t as great as many technology enthusiasts envision, car makers and the manufacturers of component parts can “expect to get to know their way around every courthouse in America,” wrote Randy Maniloff, an insurance lawyer with White and Williams LLP in Philadelphia, in an insurance-coverage newsletter.

&gt;Uber itself has made insurance a high priority in its driverless-car push.

&gt;The manager of its insurance programs, Gus Fuldner, is highly regarded in the profession of risk management. He won a “Risk Manager of the Year” award in 2016 from an insurance trade publication for innovations in managing the company’s risks as a ride-sharing company.

&gt;“He was the driving force that brought insurers, regulators and transportation network companies together in the U.S. to set a uniform standard for ride-sharing automobile liability insurance, a shift that has transformed the insurance industry,” an executive at a unit of brokerage and professional-services firm Aon PLC said in a public comment at the time of the award.",1521644715,dw1v75z,t3_862md3,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2018

Given that self driving cars right now are driving in geo-fenced areas and are not exposed to extreme weather, and have a backup human driver, I think that the death is quite significant.

I think that scenario ends in fatality a high percentage of the time with a *typical* (not best-case) human driver. It's hard to know for sure, though. LDR video makes it difficult to tell how visible she was, and we don't have context for how engaged the driver would have needed to be on the journey leading up to that point.

That being said, self driving cars are supposed to be superhuman in perception, if not in judgement. This is a technical failure on the part of the car, and of the safety driver as a failsafe system, and those are failures that Uber needs to address in terms of technology and process. 

*That* being said, we need to internalize that this will not be the last fatality like this. SDCs in testing are by definition not fully safe. Safety driver's mitigate this risk, as seen by the low overall rate of fatal accidents compared to miles driven. However, humans are fallible. They can be made less fallible by better process (the safety driver was visibly distracted, something that could be addressed by spot-checks of this footage as a matter of course). However, the risk posed by autonomous cars to the public remains non-zero. More people will die before this technology is perfected. That's essentially an inevitability. And, before we freak out and rush to regulate, we should remember that Amazon, UPS, and every trucking company and bus service routinely kills pedestrians every year. Cars are dangerous. Every company that uses them operates in a moral regime that includes human death. SDCs are not inherently different. We shouldn't regulate on the basis of panic. If different rules are required, then the fundamental case for them has not meaningfully changed since a month ago, and we should evaluate that case coldly and soberly.",1521703306,dw3ehmt,t3_8684to,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2018

&gt; ...  
&gt; 
&gt; Uber has invested heavily in driverless cars and has done extensive testing in Pittsburgh and the Phoenix area. It [announced a contract](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/11/uber-just-made-a-billion-dollar-deal-for-self-driving-volvos/) to buy 24,000 cars from Volvo in 2019—a signal it was serious about outfitting the vehicles with driverless sensors and software. But Uber's efforts have been bogged down by managerial chaos and an ongoing legal battle with Waymo. Experts we've talked to believe they're far behind Waymo.  

Waymo has regularly published information demonstrating progress over the past years, including:  

* May 2014 - navigating construction zones, railroad crossings, cyclists and hand signals: https://youtu.be/bDOnn0-4Nq8?t=23

Travis Kalanick himself, Uber co-founder and until recently CEO, admitted in testimony that Waymo is the leader in self-driving cars: https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/02/kalanick-agrees-google-was-and-is-in-the-lead-in-autonomous-vehicles/  

In contrast, Uber's self-driving testing in California got off to a rocky start because it initially tried to flout California's rules:  
https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/03/uber-rethinks-defiance-will-apply-for-self-driving-car-permit-in-california/  
&gt; On Thursday, the [*San Jose Mercury News* reported](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/03/02/uber-apply-for-state-permit-to-test-self-driving-cars/) that Uber applied for a permit to test its self-driving cars on California roads. In December, the company [said that it would not apply for the permit](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/12/uber-defiant-says-it-wont-apply-for-an-autonomous-car-permit-in-california/), but its Thursday announcement reverses this position.  
&gt; 
&gt; The news comes after a [very public spat](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/12/uber-tests-self-driving-on-san-francisco-roads-avoids-dmv-autonomy-definition/) between the ride-hailing startup and the California Department of Motor Vehicles. That spat ended with the California DMV [revoking registrations](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/12/california-dmv-revokes-ubers-self-driving-car-registrations-uber-cancels-pilot/) for Uber’s test vehicles after Uber refused to apply for permitting. Uber had claimed that its cars were merely equipped with Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS) and didn’t require permitting.  
&gt; 
&gt; Uber took its cars to Arizona, where the state assured the company that it wouldn’t have to apply for a special permit to test self-driving software.  
&gt; 
&gt; Late last week, the [*New York Times* reported](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/02/ubers-self-driving-cars-ran-through-6-stoplights-in-california-ny-times-says/) that in the short time that Uber was running its self-driving car pilot program in San Francisco in December, its cars ran through six red lights.  

Anthony Levandowski, former head of Uber's self-driving project, reportedly promoted a reckless attitude towards safety:  
http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/05/inside-uber-lawsuits-travis-kalanick.html  
&gt; Last summer, after a man died in a Tesla that was using the car’s Autopilot system, which allows for autonomous driving on highways, Levandowski told several Uber engineers that they were not pushing aggressively enough. “I’m pissed we didn’t have the first death,” Levandowski said, according to a person familiar with the conversation. (Levandowski denies saying this.)

Levandowski later left Uber due to Waymo's lawsuit, and Kalanick was forced to step down as Uber's CEO as well, but company culture can be harder to change.

The other consideration is security. If all the cars on the road use the same system, they'll all have the same attack vectors.

That said, it's questionable whether multiple systems would be much better on this front.

237,people40,"&gt; The bike is not in its path until the very end.  

First, I'd disagree with this assessment. The person was crossing from left to right, and managed to get to the right side of the car by the accident. So the person was in the path of the car for a while and had almost completely crossed the path of the car.

Furthermore, the car should be able to tell that it is on a collision course with something not immediately in it path. The road is 3 lanes wide and the car is in the far right lane. That means that for the entire time the person was crossing (5-10 seconds at least), she and the car were on a collision course. This should have been extremely detectable via LIDAR due to the lack of any obstructions. It would probably have also been obvious to an attentive human eye (even if darkness obscured her in the shitty dashcam footage). 

&gt;  This is an extreme edge case for an AI to interpret at this stage of development, in my opinion

I strongly disagree. It's a pedestrian crossing an empty street. She didn't jump out of nowhere, she crossed two lanes before getting to the lane the car was in. Lesson 1 for a self driving car should be stop if there is a person right in front of you. Lesson 2 should be stop if there is a person walking across your path who will run into.

255,CallMeOatmeal,"As of today they haven't announced a product, so there is no business model yet. We can speculate as to their potential business model based on their past comments. Right now it looks like the two likeliest possibilities for *initial* rollout are:

1.) Partnership with ridesharing apps. Aptiv/Lyft are testing this out now in Boston/Singapore. The idea is this: say you initially roll out a service in a small corner of a big city - this area will probably have low pedestrian traffic and simple, wide, well-marked roads without too many surprises. Easy for self-driving cars. If you need to travel within this small area, you pull up your Lyft/Uber app call a car, and a self driving car will arrive. But in the more likely event that you need to travel outside this area, you will be given a human-driven car, Human-driven rides will far out number autonomous ones initially, until the geo-fenced area is expanded to include more of the places people want to go. This model is based on the assumption that level 4 self-driving-cars will be very limited geographically in the initial phases. I believe this is the likeliest way this plays out because it provides the least friction for the end-user and is the easiest most realistic way to scale the technology rapidly. As far as how that deal works out monetarily between Waymo and the ride-sharing apps (I don't think their deals will be exclusive), I don't even think Google knows that.  
2.) Google/Waymo builds their own app. Either it's an exclusively self-driving ride sharing app, or they build it to compete with Uber/Lyft as well and offer human drivers outside of the geo-fence. I think this is possible, but they would have a far more difficult mountain to climb here. But it could work because self driving cars could be such a novelty that people are willing to use a separate app for it.


Of course, this is all based on the first few years of rollout. After that, I expect to see any and every business model under the sun be attempted. But don't expect self-driving cars to be significantly cheaper than regular ride-sharing in the first few years. We won't see significant cost reductions for riders until there's lots of competition and market saturation. Remember, prices of many things are not based on cost, but what people are willing to pay for them. In the first few years, people will be willing to pay the same for a regular Uber and a self-driving Uber because the technology is new and exciting.

And initially, the SDCs will be geofenced so Uber provides a one-stop shop to either get an SDC or a human driver depending on location.  But over time, as the geofence becomes less noticeable, and as people are constantly getting into an Acme SDC and bombarded with Acme advertisements stating as much, it suddenly becomes really easy for Acme to write a ride-hailing app.  And all Uber can say is, ""But...but...we're Uber!"" because they bring nothing valuable to the table anymore other than their name.

No, we don't. We need to make sure we fight against that urge that SDC must be infallable, or that they must be better than humans in every situation.  They **don't** need to be better in every situation, they will **never** be better than humans in every situation. We only need them to be better than humans in **most** situations.

- prevent 1M deaths a year
- but cause 250,000 deaths a year

- because the alternative is 1M people die

[I've been screaming this for years here:](https://np.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/435s74/solution_to_the_moral_dilemma_of_who_to_kill_in_a/czfxdi7/)

&gt; 
&gt; There's a concept that people are going to have to get used to with self driving cars. 
&gt; 
&gt; Self-driving cars are *much* safer than human drivers. Each year 30,000 people in the US, and over a million worldwide, die in car accidents. If everyone switched to self driving cars, and we could cut that number in **half**, that would be an **extraordinary** success. 
&gt; 
&gt; Here comes the part that people need to get next to: 
&gt; 
&gt; - 15,000 people a year in the US, and 500 thousand worldwide, would still die in a self-driving car
&gt; 
&gt; You have two alternatives: 
&gt; 
&gt; - 30,000 people a year die in car accidents 
&gt; - 15,000 people a year die in case accidents
&gt; 
&gt; The lower number is better. Saving 15,000 lives is what we want to do. The lower number is what we want. We **want** 15,000 people a year to die in self driving cars. 
&gt; 
&gt; Self driving cars don't have to be perfect; nor will they ever be. They just have to be better than humans.

Should you *try* to improve the technology: absolutely!

But you're going to have to start getting comfortable with the idea that a self-driving car is *different* from a *human-driven* - and people will die from a SDC that wouldn't have died if a human was driving.

&gt;Waymo has developed a robust process to collect, analyze and evaluate disengages for this report. We
set disengagement thresholds conservatively for our public road testing. The vast majority of
disengagements are not related to safety. Our test drivers routinely transition into and out of autonomous

driver in many situations that do not involve a failure of the autonomous technology and do not require an
immediate takeover of control by the driver.

&gt; To help evaluate the safety significance of disengagements, Waymo employs a powerful simulator
program. In Waymo’s simulation, our team can “replay” each incident and predict the behavior of our
self-driving car if the driver had not taken control of it, as well as the behavior and positions of other road
users in the vicinity (such as pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles). Our engineers use this data to
refine and improve the software to ensure the self-driving car performs safely.

323,WeldAE,"&gt; These things are well benchmarked and measured. Average human drivers reaction times, range of vision etc are well quantified, both in normal situations and impaired, tired, distracted etc.

I don't expect you to actually provide all the details but such a simple vague answer makes it quite obvious you don't really understand the complexity of the problem of specifying a requirement.  I'm going to guess you aren't in an engineering related field?  I'm not trying to say that's required or to put you down, it's just hard to have a conversation about how hard it is to specify something like this.  I'm sure you've encountered this in whatever field you are in where the customer says ""I want a 1500 sqft house built, how much?"" or ""How much do you charge to make a sign"".  

It would be the life works of hundreds to quantify ""better than a human driver"".  It will happen, but it will be over the next decades.

If it helps, AVs are already much better than humans in reaction time and vision.

&gt; More conditions than zero, for sure. Developing normalized tests isn't quite rocket science.

They already do a lot more than zero.  All serious AV companies already do huge amounts of simulations  based on previous encounters and variations on a theme.  They [already have test tracks](http://www.businessinsider.com/ubers-fake-city-pittsburgh-self-driving-cars-2017-10).

&gt;Yeah, and that's a good thing. 

No it's not, it will cause tens of thousands to die by delaying the deployment of fully operational AVs.

&gt; Deploying potentially fleets of killer robots and handing over decision points over human lives to a bunch of companies should not be done lightly.

It's not done lightly, billions are being spent.  The question is always how close to perfect is good enough.  A killer robot didn't kill the pedestrian, it was an accident like so many others.  A robot certainly failed to stop it from happening, that we can say for sure.

Fedex injures kills or injures hundreds of people a year *operating* their product - as does any company that operates cars on public roads. Human-driven Ubers kill people all the time. None of those people volunteered to die to improve a corporation's bottom line, but nobody cares. But as soon as a robot-driven car has a fatal accident, everyone loses their minds, and either the technology has to be perfectly safe or it has to be banned. 

It's panicky, hypocritical nonsense. Not least because, in a strictly utilitarian sense, delaying the maturing of self-driving cars will kill a *lot* more people than could possibly die during the testing. 

Human driven cars kill 3000 people a day. About 90% of that is avoidable with final SDC technology. So far, the least cautious SDC company in business has killed one person, ever. These companies could kill *hundreds* of people, and if it accelerates the takeover of robo-cars by even one day, it would still save lives. 

The potential upside to this technology in terms of public safety is so monumental that the utilitarian case you're trying to make is absurd. 

And, look, I agree Uber should start doing spot-checks of the footage of their safety drivers. It doesn't slow down their progress, costs them next to nothing, and would help mitigate these sorts of issues in the future, but let's have some frickin perspective. More than one person died in a regular, human-driven car accident in the time I was *typing this*.

Have you considered the possibility that not everyone believes in the ability to develop self driving cars that are significantly safer than human drivers in the foreseeable future? The burden or proof is on the proponents of the technology.

Have you considered the possibility that not everyone takes the utilitarian argument seriously? the utilitarian approach can only make sense when there is some consensus on the utility function.

Exactly.  I've been saying this forever.  Any time people talk about how humans are horrible drivers and they cause so many deaths and how SDCs just need to be statistically better than that...completely not true!  That is way too utilitarian and devoid of emotion.  It is not the way that people actually think.

Everything depends on the manner of death.  If SDCs are killing people in a way that the public feels a human driver could have avoided, people will NOT trust SDCs.  Even if SDCs are killing people at half the rate, if those deaths are freak accidents like this one, people won't trust the cars.

I usually propose a thought experiment.  If someone presents you with a fully self driving car and shows you that you are 50% less likely to die in this car, that sounds great, right?  But, oh, by the way, in those cases where you do die, it's because the car inexplicably floors it into a brick wall.  Or spontaneously explodes.  Do you still want to get into this car?  Doesn't that feel so much more like a gamble?

The companies didn’t share details of the agreement other than to say Waymo has the option to purchase up to 20,000 I-Pace vehicles (they cost $70,000 apiece at retail) and that **Tata has some sort of financial stake in the effort, implying it is more involved than Waymo’s first partnership with Fiat Chrysler. Waymo CEO John Krafcik previously told us what such a carmaker stake would look like—a share of eventual robotaxi revenue.** India-based Tata is a relatively small automaker—Fiat Chrysler is several times bigger than Tata in terms of vehicles sales per year—so Waymo no doubt will continue to try to bring more established automakers into the fold. In the meantime Waymo still has to do the hard part: make its software ready for places other than Phoenix suburbs, where it’s trying to launch robotaxis, and scale up its hardware manufacturing.

360,Mortar_Art,"I think the danger is that self driving cars could specifically be used to change pedestrian behaviour. Consider the other post where someone mentions the origin of the term jaywalking, and now apply this more broadly to public space in a country like the USA or Australia, where cars dominate. Footpaths (sidewalks) are very narrow, and cluttered, while roads occupy as much as 30% of the public land. Many roads have become barriers that are impossible to pass for pedestrians or even cyclists. Outside of 'progressively planned' areas in these countries, pedestrian crossings are few and far between. Sometimes a 1km journey as the crow flies is as far as 5km by foot, but only 1.1km by car.

And this is infrastructure that has already been paid for by the public, so there's a massive financial incentive for companies like Uber to exploit that resource.

And not just to exploit it, but to dominate it.

Giving space and time over to pedestrians and cyclists who want to use that infrastructure would cut into the profits.

The implication being made in a lot of these comments, that this would be impossible ... that SDC would be better able to stop and give a pedestrian the ability to cross a busy motorway are in my my view naive. First of all, it's not just SDCs on the road, as they're implemented. They're interacting with, and have to account for human drivers. This means that they can't just jam on the breaks immediately and utilise some excellent theoretical braking distance on a freeway, when something runs in front of them. They have to consider the vehicle behind them. And to their side.

But now imagine they've become the dominant vehicle on the road. They're packed so closely together and are moving at such high speeds, even in busy commercial areas, that as a pedestrian, it's clear there's no gap for you to cross, and they would not be able to brake without risking a pile up.

Your freedom to access that place by foot is reduced, not enhanced. And your motivation for getting in one of those cars is increased.",1522192100,dwe24ox,t3_87jd7a,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2018

It is perfect feasible and probably already done to have an Android app to call a Waymo car and tell it where you want it to go. The integration of that app with the Google assistent is then just a matter of time, and probably could already be done. But this is a relatively small piece of work relative to the current ongoing process at Waymo.

The other interpretation is to integrate Waymo tech into Android, meaning your phone will observe the environment, make decisions, and then control the cars acceleration and steering, i.e. the ""self driving"" portion will be done by the phone, not a computer attached to the car. That won't be feasible for a while, at least 10 years, because it is quite hard to interpret all the data and make sane decisions, while maintaining low latency.

380,[deleted],"&gt; Hmm are self driving cars going to have different protocols based on city or are they just going to be the most strict laws?

I'd say that SDCs will have to obey all local laws.  If there is a state or local law the SDC needs to accommodate it.

This is going to be a huge 'road block' to true autonomy because human's will *frequently* break traffic laws when they feel it's OK--maybe it's crossing the double yellow to pass a stopped car on the road, or proceeding into an intersection despite obstacles because they know they must do it in order to get through--rotaries are one I just can't imagine a SDC handling well.

This means SDC's must also obey road signs and human police officers, or flagmen, giving hand signals--neither of which SDCs are even remotely capable of doing now?

What happens when you have a road sign giving an instruction and the instruction hasn't reached the SDC via whatever complex set of APIs it uses to get local traffic/road information?  Weather changes, the road signs all say highway reduced to 40MPH... the signs are all clear and bright, but the SDC is blind to them, continues at 65MPH because that's what its latest set of data says this road's limit is.

Or when a cop is standing in the road telling you stop, or motioning you around active construction... is an SDC capable of this?  Until that's solved it's impossible to allow SDCs to be completely autonomous unless we create specific roads designed for their limitations, and enable police/traffic enforcement with standardized and intuitive tools that allow them to direct the SDCs.

In much of the safety equipment world there are protective measures in place that are better than their human counter parts or provide protections there is no human equivalent for.  Still in these cases if the safety equipment fails to do its job the manufacturer risks ending up somewhere on a spectrum of fault, and thus a spectrum of responsibility. This is what happened here with uber, safety equipment failed at its job in an area of this spectrum that includes shared fault with the pedestrian.

In defense of the self-driving car though, this patch of highway is a nightmare. The crash happened at a ramp that used to be a part of my commute. I saw human drivers almost kill themselves every single day.

The leftmost-lane on southbound 101 in that spot is an HOV lane that suddenly becomes a carpool flyover exit lane that transfers you to 85, with minimal signage/warning. This happens just a mile or two after the lane is added IIRC. Signage and GPSes don't make it very obvious that the new lane is going to disappear very soon. Every single time, the left-most lane is filled with a ton of cars going 80+ MPH which suddenly panic and frantically attempt to merge right at the last second when they see they're about to get shot into the sky onto a different highway.

Penalty for failure to merge right quickly enough is certain death. There's a median that suddenly appears that has the saddest, least visible reflective thing ever made on it. I believe this is what this Tesla crashed into: https://goo.gl/maps/MdfbQsH5vWE2

I have no idea why the road is designed that way, with a sudden median in the middle of the road that will definitely kill you if you're not far enough to the right or left. Terrible infrastructure design.

Tesla appears to be claiming that at the time of the crash, the pathetic reflective ""safety barrier"" on the median was absent. If that's true, I'd say Caltrans is liable for the death.

429,RIGradStudent,"Wow, there is a lot to unpack from this article. 

&gt; Depending on the day, some vehicles still pick up passengers. But Uber has switched much of its autonomous fleet to simply driving in an effort to orient operators towards “accumulating miles and gathering data to help the system become more reliable,” according to a New York Times article based on leaked company documents. As of September 2017, the autonomous fleet had driven one million miles across its test cities. By December 2017, it celebrated two million miles, and “added its next million at an even faster clip, according to company documents,” the Times reported.

Seems like they decided to stop with their business of transporting people and just try to rack up the numbers, but why? Was it because they needed more data, and passenger routes weren't giving them that? Or did they just want to be able to say ""we ran X miles autonomously, see how fast we are catching up""? 


&gt;Still, as the vehicle technology improved, the temptation to let the mind wander (or to pick up a phone) while on the road was that much greater, the ex-employees said. “An hour or two hours can go by without ever once having to take over the wheel,” said the anonymous former safety driver, who said he’d worked on the same loop in Tempe where the fatal crash occurred. “You think, maybe I could take my eyes off the road, because, if anything happens, the car is going to react.”

This is pretty much the exact opposite of what has been reported lately (&lt;13 miles per intervention), and not what I experienced in Pittsburgh (although that was a different city and was quite a while ago). The driver had to take control when picking me up and dropping me off, and there were a couple times when it would just randomly hand over control to the driver. Though if they didn't have to deal with any passengers, I guess they would never have to find a spot to pull over to.

&gt; “That was one of our biggest rules: No phone in the left seat,” said the Tempe-based former operator. (Indeed, this was the offense that led to his own dismissal.) “Her one job was to be there to monitor and ensure that the robot keeps going safely. That’s her one job that she wasn’t doing.”

&gt; According to an Uber spokesperson, safety drivers undergo a “vigorous” three-week training, testing, and certification program before they hit the road. In it, they are trained to keep hands hovering near the wheel at all times so that they can quickly take control when the car does not safely respond to dangerous road conditions or “noncompliant actors,” such as people walking in the roadway. While Uber allows operators to keep phones in their vehicles in case of emergencies, the company has a zero-tolerance policy for the use of digital devices while vehicles are in motion. The company monitors driver behavior via spot-checks of interior dash-cam footage, self-reporting, and reports from other operators.  

Well, if they have had to dismiss so many people, obviously their policy isn't working too well. I wonder if there is a better way to prevent this while still ensuring people have access to the phone if they need it.

&gt; Both former operators also expressed surprise that Uber’s self-driving technology had failed, too. Something went deeply wrong here, they said—the cars were often super-sensitive to obstructions, even non-existent ones. “Sometimes the car would brake because of steam coming up from a pothole in the ground,” the anonymous operator said.

This is what I don't understand, because I experienced the exact same thing in the car in Pittsburgh, though it never did go at high speeds. If anything, the car was overly cautious around everything. I just don't see how it couldn't have seen the person and at least tried to stop.

&gt;Yet implicit in such a relationship between car and human is what technologists call the “handoff problem,” or the flawed expectation that driving responsibility can be safely passed from machines to humans in a split-second. 

So, this is just speculation, but what if the reason the car didn't react at all was because it wasn't in auto in the seconds leading up to the accident? And I don't mean the millisecond before impact, but a few seconds before the crash. The only evidence that we have that the car was in auto was the police statement (which was probably taken from the driver), but they have already messed up a lot of things with this case. What if, a few seconds before the crash, the car dropped out of autonomous mode for some reason and the driver (who was not paying attention at all) didn't notice it?  When I was in it and the car handed over control, the car made a fairly loud ding, so I would imagine she heard it. Or maybe she heard it, thought it was a false positive, and ignored it? I know it is quite a stretch, but it would explain why the vehicle didn't react at all when it has done so many times in the past.


Still a lot of questions that need to be answered, but if this was the case, it is clear they need to significantly improve their hand-off system. Hopefully the NTSB finished their investigation soon.",1522631694,dwnjzz3,t3_88urc4,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2018

The DOT may have their own standards but it's in everyone's self interest to keep them safe enough for self driving cars to continue operating and gaining more autonomy over time.

We will eventually reach a point where virtually no markings at all are needed but for now there is a huge need to gain the public's trust in this technology and if that means helping the DOT make the markings better then it needs to happen.

Just silly.

The Tesla detects the hands on the wheel, it's not by turning.  You should make a correction.

It's important that he was warned because it demonstrates the driver was actively ignoring the car's attempts to get him to do his job and drive.

It is also important that he had it set to the minimum following distance because that would give him the minimum time and distance to correct.

How I interpret their points: *He set it to the minimum which requires the most attention and wasn't paying attention.*

Not only that, but he removed his hands as he was approaching the area where he knew the Tesla had trouble: *the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision*

Full Self-Driving Hardware on All Cars
All Tesla vehicles produced in our factory, including Model 3, have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver.

Advanced Sensor Coverage
Eight surround cameras provide 360 degrees of visibility around the car at up to 250 meters of range. Twelve updated ultrasonic sensors complement this vision, allowing for detection of both hard and soft objects at nearly twice the distance of the prior system. A forward-facing radar with enhanced processing provides additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength that is able to see through heavy rain, fog, dust and even the car ahead.

Processing Power Increased 40x
To make sense of all of this data, a new onboard computer with over 40 times the computing power of the previous generation runs the new Tesla-developed neural net for vision, sonar and radar processing software. Together, this system provides a view of the world that a driver alone cannot access, seeing in every direction simultaneously, and on wavelengths that go far beyond the human senses.

Enhanced Autopilot
Enhanced Autopilot adds these new capabilities to the Tesla Autopilot driving experience. Your Tesla will match speed to traffic conditions, keep within a lane, automatically change lanes without requiring driver input, transition from one freeway to another, exit the freeway when your destination is near, self-park when near a parking spot and be summoned to and from your garage.

Tesla’s Enhanced Autopilot software has begun rolling out and features will continue to be introduced as validation is completed, subject to regulatory approval. Every driver is responsible for remaining alert and active when using Autopilot, and must be prepared to take action at any time.

On-ramp to Off-rampOnce on the freeway, your Tesla will determine which lane you need to be in and when. In addition to ensuring you reach your intended exit, Autopilot will watch for opportunities to move to a faster lane when you're caught behind slower traffic. When you reach your exit, your Tesla will depart the freeway, slow down and transition control back to you.

Full Self-Driving Capability
Build upon Enhanced Autopilot and order Full Self-Driving Capability on your Tesla. This doubles the number of active cameras from four to eight, enabling full self-driving in almost all circumstances, at what we believe will be a probability of safety at least twice as good as the average human driver. The system is designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat. For Superchargers that have automatic charge connection enabled, you will not even need to plug in your vehicle.

All you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go. If you don’t say anything, the car will look at your calendar and take you there as the assumed destination or just home if nothing is on the calendar. Your Tesla will figure out the optimal route, navigate urban streets (even without lane markings), manage complex intersections with traffic lights, stop signs and roundabouts, and handle densely packed freeways with cars moving at high speed. When you arrive at your destination, simply step out at the entrance and your car will enter park seek mode, automatically search for a spot and park itself. A tap on your phone summons it back to you.

Please note that Self-Driving functionality is dependent upon extensive software validation and regulatory approval, which may vary widely by jurisdiction. It is not possible to know exactly when each element of the functionality described above will be available, as this is highly dependent on local regulatory approval. Please note also that using a self-driving Tesla for car sharing and ride hailing for friends and family is fine, but doing so for revenue purposes will only be permissible on the Tesla Network, details of which will be released next year.",1522729280,dwpo1b5,t1_dwpirdy,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2018
463,bradtem,"There are not multiple levels of self-driving car.  Unfortunately somebody who really didn't know very much at NHTSA declared several years ago that there were ""levels"" when in fact there are not.  The SAE did the same thing, but backtracked to say that while they have numbers, they should not be considered an ordering.    Which is correct, because so called ""level 4"" was deployed by Navya before anybody deployed ""2"" (except as a demo) or ""3"" (which may never get deployed beyond traffic jams.)

I and others at the time decried these levels.  We were worried that they would make people think there were commonalities between ADAS autopilot driver assist systems and self-driving cars.   

But the vocabulary got out and is commonly used in spite of being in error, and as you point out, it is so common that it has possibly lead to the confusion between the technologies, and thus to deaths.

The right thing to say would have been, ""There are no levels.  There is advanced driver assist, and there are robocars, and while they use some technologies in common, they are different animals.  One should not confuse them, or think the way to build the robocar is to make the ADAS incrementally better.""

465,bradtem,"While many people believe ""level 3"" is a bad idea, it's a full self-driving car which, because it's operating domain is small, needs to be able to do live handoff to a human driver at speed.     All robocars have an operating domain (there really is no level 5, except in science fiction for now.)     The main complication is that there are two types of exits from the operating domain.  The first is a planned one, which takes place at a highway exit for example.  There, the occupant could even sleep during self-drive.   If you want to support unplanned disengage (due to the traffic jam ending) it is not safe to allow sleep.  But in general there is a feeling by many that handoff at speed is a dangerous thing.    Not super dangerous, but still presenting a danger.

The safest plan for a car with a limited domain is one that drives you to the edge of it and stops, and then you drive the stopped car.  No handoff at speed.  Frankly I don't know if the levels folks would call that 3 or 4, and it doesn't matter.   The main thing about level 3 is that they want to do handoff in places you can't stop (middle of traffic, or on a highway because the car can't exit.)

At Google, we did indeed plan to try to build that first, an on-ramp to off-ramp car.   That plan was abandoned.",1522738138,dwpuf06,t1_dwpqxx1,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2018

So, to think that now we have cars that can cover these distances on autopilot, without crashing one way or another, is quite impressive.

479,ZenithSal,"So many people keep ignoring this fact: Teslas don't have self-driving features yet! 

It's a scheduled feature for this year that's no where near ready as far as we know.

The Autopilot feature is just a more capable form of cruise control, wasn't designed to drive in bad weather or understand incorrect road markings or avoid stationary obstacles even. It has 2 functions for lane control: follow markings if visible and/otherwise follow the car directly in front of you at the distance you want. Never ever depend on it to drive safely by itself unmonitored.

Teslas emergency brakes are designed to operate only when a collision is determined to be inevitable with another vehicle to minimize the impact. Here's the actual description of the feature from the Oct 2017 update:

“Automatic Emergency Braking, a new collision Avoidance Assist feature, is designed to automatically engage the brakes to reduce the impact of an unavoidable frontal collision with another vehicle. The brakes disengage when you press hard on the accelerator pedal, release the brake pedal, or sharply turn the steering wheel.” (source: https://electrek.co/2017/10/11/tesla-autopilot-2-5-automatic-emergency-braking-fleet/)

To be honest, Tesla's marketing should take some of the blame for this misconception as they highlight phrases like this: 

""All Tesla vehicles produced in our factory, including Model 3, have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver."" (source: https://www.tesla.com/en_NZ/autopilot)

481,ArchaneChutney,"&gt; The lane lines go straight into it.

I think your interpretation of the video is that the lane suddenly ends.  Actually, there are temporary lane markings that divert *both* lanes away from the barrier.  I'm not going to argue that the temporary lane markings are ideal, but the humans in the other cars certainly knew what to do.  Additionally, you can see a construction sign at 0:04 warning that the lanes are going to veer like that.  There is yet another construction sign at 0:10, but the camera doesn't clearly show what it says.

Temporary lane markings are used all over the United States during construction.  They usually try to erase the old lane markings when placing temporary lane markings, but I've never seen a case where the old lane markings are successfully fully erased.  They depend on humans to realize that they should use the temporary lane markings rather than the old lane markings.  That works out well enough that we still do it that way.  This is a situation I've always thought would pose a problem for self-driving cars and this video demonstrates it.

&gt; The truck in front of the M/S just makes the lane change in time.

The truck in front didn't suddenly make a lane change.  The truck in front simply followed the temporary lane markings.  There was _no_ emergency action taken by the truck in front, the truck simply did what it was supposed to do.

&gt; The car can't make a lane change on its own.

Let's say that Autopilot can't be depended upon to detect temporary lane markings.  Fine, fair enough.  I still dislike the argument that Autopilot couldn't have done anything else.  Slowing down or stopping would have been entirely valid options.

Even if the car couldn't detect the barrier itself, the car would have seen the old lane markings end abruptly.  Despite the abrupt ending of the old lane markings, Autopilot decided to keep going at full speed hoping that things would somehow work out?  That doesn't seem like appropriate behavior in any case.

&gt; the driver wasn't paying attention like they should

How do you know that?  The driver could have thought that there was no way the Tesla was going to run into the barrier and that the Tesla would instead pick up on the temporary lane markings.  There is about a second between the Tesla leaving the temporary lane markings behind and running into the barrier.  A second to respond wouldn't be enough for even an attentive driver, studies have shown that even attentive backup drivers need 2-3 seconds on average to takeover.",1522828748,dws6eps,t1_dws1oc0,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2018

For reference, the simplest definition of a Level 5 driving system is this: the full-time performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task **under all roadway and environmental conditions that can be managed by a human driver**

That's absurd. There's absolutely no reason why it should do that.

A vehicle should never enter a new section of road, at a speed where it can't manouvre or brake to avoid a person sized object. If you did program a self driving car to change behaviour (presumably slow down) before approaching a cross walk, around something like a blind corner, then you are already acknowledging that you're driving the vehicle beyond it's own capacity to survive a catastrophic crash, if there was, for example, a boulder on the road.",1522922444,dwuf832,t1_dwrvg83,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2018
492,JoseJimeniz,"&gt;. SDCs have been better than people at this particular scenario for years already. If you can't get this basics, get off the streets. 

Fundamentally: no.

Self driving cars **will** be worse than humans at some things, and as a result they will **cause** more accidents where fewer existed.

&gt; But we need them to be better in every situation

No, we don't. We need to make sure we fight against that urge that SDC must be infallable, or that they must be better than humans in every situation.  They **don't** need to be better in every situation, they will **never** be better than humans in every situation. We only need them to be better than humans in **most** situations.

If self-driving cars:

- prevent 1M deaths a year
- but cause 250,000 deaths a year
- that's a **huge** win
- that's over the moon
- that's a home run
- we want 250k people to die
- because the alternative is 1M people die

[I've been screaming this for years here:](https://np.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/435s74/solution_to_the_moral_dilemma_of_who_to_kill_in_a/czfxdi7/)

&gt; 
&gt; There's a concept that people are going to have to get used to with self driving cars. 
&gt; 
&gt; Self-driving cars are *much* safer than human drivers. Each year 30,000 people in the US, and over a million worldwide, die in car accidents. If everyone switched to self driving cars, and we could cut that number in **half**, that would be an **extraordinary** success. 
&gt; 
&gt; Here comes the part that people need to get next to: 
&gt; 
&gt; - 15,000 people a year in the US, and 500 thousand worldwide, would still die in a self-driving car
&gt; 
&gt; You have two alternatives: 
&gt; 
&gt; - 30,000 people a year die in car accidents 
&gt; - 15,000 people a year die in case accidents
&gt; 
&gt; The lower number is better. Saving 15,000 lives is what we want to do. The lower number is what we want. We **want** 15,000 people a year to die in self driving cars. 
&gt; 
&gt; Self driving cars don't have to be perfect; nor will they ever be. They just have to be better than humans.

Should you *try* to improve the technology: absolutely!

But you're going to have to start getting comfortable with the idea that a self-driving car is *different* from a *human-driven* - and people will die from a SDC that wouldn't have died if a human was driving. 

Concrete example
---------------

Lets say that SDCs can reduce vehicular death by 50%, but ***double*** pedestrian deaths.

&gt; I'm not ok with a 50% reduction in crash risk for cars in exchange for doubling the crash risk for pedestrians

Using some real numbers:

- annual pedestrian deaths in California: [630](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DCDIC/SACB/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Crash%20Medical%20Outcomes%20Data%20\(CMOD\)%20Project/Pedestrian%20injuries%20Report_June%202017-ADA.pdf)
- annual vehicular deaths in California: [3,680](https://www.scpr.org/news/2017/02/15/69102/more-people-are-dying-on-california-s-roads/)

| Item | Before | After |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Pedestrian | 630 | 1,260 *(doubling)* |
| Vehicular | 3,680 | 1,840 *(50% reduction)* |
| **Total** | **4,310** | **3,100** *(1,210 lives saved)* |

You **prefer** that 1,210 people die. This is what we're talking about:

- self-driving cars saving lives

Self-driving cars will ***never*** be better than all humans in all possible situations. **Never**. 

- there will always be a human who is better than a SDC in some situation
- there will always be a human better than you in some situation
- that doesn't mean we don't let you drive
- we let you drive, *knowing* you're going to kill someone.
- we let SDC drive, *knowing* they're going to kill someone.

Another thing is that most accidents are caused by some stupid and avoidable human error, such as texting, speeding or drunk driving. 

If your SDC is as good as an average human, or even twice as good, it's still shit. It still kills half a million people per year. I want it to be as good as an experienced, attentive driver who watches road signs and properly maintains their car. Number of deaths due to unavoidable mechanical issues is A LOT lower than 1 million per year. ",1522942925,dwuw44e,t1_dwuhmhi,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2018
497,CallMeOatmeal,"&gt;Hmm, wonder how restricting/far reaching that deal goes and how long it is for.

It's just for current testing of the Pacificas, per the article:

""The rental car firm will service and store Waymo’s Chrysler Pacifica minivans in Phoenix, where the parent of Google is testing a ride-hailing service with volunteer members of the public. Waymo will own the vehicles and pay Avis for its service, an arrangement that is set for multiple years but not exclusive. The companies would not share financial terms.""

&gt;Waymo is gonna want that money

And I'm sure they'll get as much of the pie as they can as long as that pie is within their core competencies. But things like managing the maintenance of a fleet, basic economics dictates that it's probably more profitable to hand that off to a company that is 100% focused on fleet maintenance. Google isn't about to get into the car repair game, it's not what they do.

&gt;with coding like Ethereum, companies like Lyft are unnecessary.

Lyft's value to a self-driving car fleet isn't the technology, it's the active base of users and drivers. Initial Lvl4 services will be geo-fenced into specific areas like select suburbs of Phoenix, and outside those zones you're going to need a human driver. The value proposition of a Lyft/Uber partnership is the ability to integrate self driving into those apps so riders can continue to use them as they always have, and the self-driving will be seamlessly integrated and called upon when within the geo-fence. I'm not saying Google will definitely do this, but there is real value proposition there that shouldn't be dismissed based on the technology, which is really unimportant in a business sense. If Google doesn't take advantage of that strategy, another company (probably Aptiv) definitely will. And Google doesn't want Aptiv to eat their lunch.

Look into MobilEye's RSS. Their approach formally defines the boundaries of safe driving. It is basically a lengthy and meticulous specification of situations and how a car should respond to them. MobilEye provides a proof by induction that their driving policy ensures that the car will never violate the RSS constraints. 

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.06374.pdf

Read that paper and understand it. If we can formally define safe driving, then it becomes closer to bringing autonomous vehicles on the roads because we will be able to prove their safety. If safe driving means the car will do x under y, z situations, etc, then if we can prove that the car will always do that, then we can by extension say that the system is safe.

I didn't really say its easy to develop ADAS.  I would say however, it is easy to develop a system with no minimum performance requirement.  For example, it's very easy to develop a low performance highway lane keeping system, this could be done in a few weeks or few days more so. I have done this several times via many methods.

&gt;If people could so easily develop driver assist systems, in a few months or even weeks as you said,

&gt;why did Intel buy MobilEye for 15 billion dollars?

I feel a lot of the time it is not necessary.  However, I will throw out statements, and then see which of those statements the other party disagrees with, and when that happens we will both explain why we feel so and share sources in when necessary.

It would be a waste of time to share sources for every statement, even the ones that we already agree on.

Now to get back to my statement:
""And developing a super reliable self driving system that is so reliable you can trust it without human supervision, is a very very challenging problem that takes many years to develop and validate""

Do you agree with this statement?  I assumed that you would, but I could be wrong.  If you do disagree with this statement, I would elaborate and share sources to why I believe so.

&gt;Look into MobilEye's RSS.

I am super familiar.

&gt;Read that paper and understand it.

I have read this paper multiple times already.  I am in favor of the arguments it makes and about RSS in general.

&gt;If safe driving means the car will do x under y, z situations, etc, then if we can prove that the car will always do that, then we can by extension say that the system is safe.

I agree with you.

However, I have a couple of comments.

1) This only applies to planning... Perception cannot be proved safe this way, perception must be validated.  My source on this?  Amnon Shashu the author of the 2 papers you sent me (he has explained this in many of his presentations),  as well as other mobileye executives that I have talked to and are involved with RSS.

2) RSS is very important, but you do not need to RSS to build a fully self driving system, don't even need it to build a safe self driving system that doesn't require human supervision. However, I do believe RSS is very important for building a minimum viable product and commercializing and scaling autonomous driving.

3)  Safety comes in many different types, RSS only addresses one of the types of safety, but there are others.  However, I know companies like mobileye and many others do have plans in place to address all the areas of safety. And I think mobileye and others will be successful, but it takes a long time to do so and it's not easy.

Also., I am happy to talk about RSS, but I am confused it doesn't seem to have anything to do with what I said earlier, can you explain the connection to me.

Also, I notice that that you have quoted two papers from mobileye and seem to bring them up,  are you perhaps a data scientist / developer at intel/mobileye?

Then in a few years when self driving is a thing they can drop fares 50% and still make more than they do now. Right now the vast majority of the fee doesn’t go to lyft. It doesn’t go to car maintenance. It goes to the driver. Eliminate the driver and you have a huge amount of savings.

Now maybe they don’t want to pass those savings along, but another company will. 


There are other factors you’re neglecting:


It depends on the network effect. People are willing to ride in cars with other people, as long as those people aren’t homeless, which various “membership pricing plans” can politically address. 

Imagine a world where 20% of cars on the road in a city are on waymo shared service. Then you call your waymo and are picked up. You join 2 other people in the minivan and now are paying half as much as you would if you were driving alone (and waymo gets 150% of the regular fare, making a nice chunk of change too). 

Congestion charges are inevitable - everywhere. This will further incentivize shared private transport as you will be docked 10-15 bucks a day you drive your car. Think LA, Chicago, nyc, Boston, DC. All of these cities will eventually pass something along these lines. NYC is like, right now. 

Will people in the middle of nowhere ever have self driving cars? I don’t know. I don’t care either. The 80+% of people in civilization will. 

People act like this is just a bus but what people hate about buses are 1: you have to go way out of your way to find the bus stop. 2: the buses don’t come frequently. 3: the buses often don’t stop where you need them to stop. 4: homeless people.

A self driving car mini bus (~8 people) solves all of those issues.

If you don’t like it you can pay a lot more to own your own car + pay an extra 8,000 a year in congestion taxes. The roads will be a lot faster too, as most people will opt for transit. At least that’s what happened in other countries. 

The single largest cost of driving is just the depreciation of the car over time anyway. Try to sell a 2014 model with 0 miles on it vs a 2018 model with 0 miles.

Not really, but existing laws were written with the assumption that cars are driven by humans so there are lots of unintended consequences that apply to self-driving cars.

There are also laws about airbags that say you need to have a steering wheel with an airbag. This means that if there's no steering wheel, the vehicle isn't legal for road use.

A lot of the new laws are probably more applicable to companies wanting to provide a taxi service, where the rider will have zero control over the operation of the vehicle other than specifying a destination and there won't be a driver present.

Services like these are probably illegal in most states because of old laws that say that a driver must maintain control of the vehicle at all times.

65,thewimsey,"All of this is currently covered by product liability laws, which can already deal with driving assist programs as well as eventual self driving cars. 

The principle is straightforward: if a manufacturer makes a product that: (1) has a defect; and (2) (in most states) the defect is ""unreasonably dangerous""; the manufacturer *and everyone in the chain of commerce* (meaning also the distributer and the dealer) are liable for the damages. 

Consider three separate situations with AEB.

1. A company's AEB generally works, but fails to brake for a pedestrian in a particular instance because, say, the pedestrian was wearing white clothes and there was a white background (or any other unusual circumstance). In this case, the manufacturer is probably not liable because the state of technology doesn't permit perfect detection and there will always be some edge cases.  It's no different from an airbag that doesn't deploy due to a weird collision which somehow misses the sensors.

2. A company's AEB system generally works, but the one installed in your car was put in wrong at the factory and, basically, never works. There would be liability in this case because you were sold a genuinely defective product. Although the damages might be adjusted downward depending on your contribution to the accident. This is sort of analogous to a manufacturing defect in a tire.

3. There was a flaw in the design of the company's AEB system so that it only detects orange cars 10% of the time. Again, the company would be liable for this because the product is actually defective. (This is the Takata airbag situation, basically). 

The hardest thing to prove in a products liability case is (depending) that the device was actually defective - which is quite different from whether it failed in a particular instance. 

With fully SDCs, the question would be the same - was the design or manufacture of a particular SDC unreasonably dangerous? ",1551641050,ehpsy0o,t3_awtz3e,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2019

consumer owned self driving.

But when we go to L4/L5, the driver basically disappears from the equation and \*cannot\* be relied upon to supervise and to take legal responsibility for real-time supervision and operation.  There will literally be no connections between the occupants of the vehicle and the car, ie: L4/L5 by definition must be drive-by-wire.

The removal of the supervising 'driver' is where there will be a dramatic shift of liability onto the manufacturers.  Which will make SDC's devastatingly expensive.   With HDC's, the human driver in an accident is basically sued up to the limits of insurance and assets, which acts as a limit on how much plaintiff's lawyers can recover in damages.  However, with SDCs, the manufacturers have dramatically greater resources and are not limited by the limitations of typical driver net worth or the size of a liability insurance policy.",1551658216,ehqf7q2,t1_ehqe0mk,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2019

For levels 3-4, there is still a human to takeover, which will require regular liability insurance, so the structure will likely be that you get a discount from your insurer, possibly based on the ratio of miles driven autonomous:manual. In an accident, the driver gets sued, and their insurance and manufacturer hash out responsibility. 

Level 5, depends on whether it has manual controls. If so, you still need liability insurance, you get sued, and its sorted out whether you were driving or the SDC system. 

But when there is no manual controls, it gets more interesting. At this point, the only reason the manufacturer wouldn't be liable is if the owner doesn't maintain it, or tampers with the system. At this point, the manufacturer will want to take responsibility for maintenance, sell that as a feature.

But I was wrong, it added lots of confusion and sort of derailed the conversation.

However, entirely off topic of what I wanted to talk about... was Waymo personal vehicles.  I never shared sources of where Waymo said they would sell personal vehicles.

I didn't find the ones I was thinking of but I found several others:

Ctrl F. personal or retail.


But it's whatever, I think we both agree that Waymo is far more focused on the ride hailing market, and the personally owned vehicles is a much smaller market with less drastic effects on society.. But just wanted to share.


Now to return to the subject.

&gt;The car keeps you in your lane on the highway and has stop and go cruise which to me could easily malfunction and kill. Why would the liability be any different than a full self driving car?

This answer to this question depends what you are asking, and how you define ""fully self driving"".. that is not a clear definition...

sometimes people use this to simply mean all features of driving on public roads have been implemented...lane changing, roundabouts, traffic lights, unprotected lights etc...

other people use that definition to mean the vehicle is actually self driving and the self driving creator is assuming liability and the user does not need to supervise.

Many people including myself believe it is dangerous to use the term ""fully self driving"" to mean the prior.  But companies like Tesla DO use the term ""fully self driving"" as the name of a feature they sell that is not self driving, but is an ADAS feature that requires supervision.

&gt;Why would the liability be any different than a full self driving car?

If we are talking about actual self driving...even semi self driving... the automaker can assume liability of the feature when they sell the feature.  And I believe this will be the case for the majority, if not all self driving vehicles sold to consumers (of course excluding Tesla's Driver assist feature called ""fully self driving"")

&gt;The car brakes for pedestrians automatically. What if it fails? 

Depends if it is ADAS or self driving... Depends if the automaker says you are liable or they are liable... depends if the automaker says you can take your eyes off the road or if it requires constant supervision.


Now like others have said, if there is an actual malfunction of a product that causes an accident... then likely the manufacturer would be responsible even if it's not a self driving car. However, it is important to describe what is a malfunction and what isn't.

If there is an ACC/AEB feature activated and the vehicle crashes into a barrier, or into a car that cuts in..  this is not a malfunction of ACC/AEB feature.  It may be related to a performance efficiency in the ACC system, and a more advanced system may have prevented the accident... but the systems was not designed or advertised to prevent all accidents, and therefore not a malfunction, and the consumer/owners is still liable. Similarly, if Tesla ""fully self driving"" fails to. brake fora vehicle and crashes into it. due to a performance deficiency... most likely this is also not a malfunction and the consumer/owner would still be liable.

One final discussion point that came up,

It is very true that personally owned self driving vehicles, L3/L4 vehicles sold to end users... will be a much smaller market and much smaller effects on society. I agree for sure.  However, for many people it is absolutely  life changing.  For example myself, I plan to purchase a SAE L3/L4 vehicle even if the feature only activates on certain major mapped freeways. And I will not be liable for accidents that happen in self driving mode, and nor will I be concerned about taking my eyes off the road.   I could buy a L2 vehicle today... these are very cool and being the geek I am, I enjoy them greatly. However, it doesn't really change anything, it's just a cool toy that I need to babysit that I can observe how it performs.",1551681347,ehr3f2f,t1_ehq25ay,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2019

But this is not the right frame of reference.

In layman’s terms, the important distinction for liability is: Who is driving? The human or the car?

For the Hyundai (and other cars sold today) the human is driving, so the manufacturer does not assume liability.

In the future, for a car that is doing the driving, my assumption is that the manufacturer would assume liability. Audi was going to assume liability for their Traffic Jam Pilot feature, but it didn’t end up getting released in the US. 

To my knowledge, the Audi example is the closest we have of a manufacturer assuming liability.

If we're already required to build cars that work fine without V2V, which we are, then V2V is just a distraction from the first set.

A manufacturing defect implies that the problem existed at the time of manufacturing, so even operating something for 10 years when the product is only specified for 5 would not preclude a manufacturing defect from being present.  And thus, certainly open to litigation.

The problem with manufacturing parts for life-critical systems, such as self-driving cars, is that plaintiff's attorneys will often bring lots of cases that have absolutely no merit against you when there is an incident.  A crash of a Boeing 737 airliner, for instance, typically will bring litigation against literally hundreds of component manufacturers that are involved in the airplane.  It is then a very expensive endeavour, legally, to come to an apportionment of liability.  In practice, many companies simply enter into small settlements, rather than pay for the cost of having to deal with years of litigation.  The cost of proving that a manufacturer wasn't negligent is often far more than the damage due to potential negligence itself!  

The cost of such litigation has to be borne by the manufacturer, who must price their products accordingly.  Or else they will eventually cease to exist as a manufacturer or supplier.  

And yes, part of the cost of a brand new gun is in defence of lawsuits that may be brought against the gun manufacturers for all causes of action, whether with or without merit.  Unfortunately corporate defendants \*rarely\* are able to recover even a small fraction of the true cost of failed litigation from unsuccessful plaintiffs.

102,mark0fo,"&gt;But I have not seen anything to indicate liability is going to be a huge cost issue.

I'm not aware of anyone really talking about it seriously, other than some guy on Reddit...  :O  

But its a giant elephant in the room that these companies really don't want to talk about, because the consequences of having a liability regime work out, in practice, to be like general aviation, would basically be catastrophic to the financial viability of self-driving cars.

Yet absent major changes in legislation that limit liability, and consolidate all liability claims to be against a specific integrator (ie: if your Tesla vehicle malfunctions, you only get to sue Tesla, not any of Tesla's suppliers), I just don't see how it won't work out like general aviation.  

Truth be told, I don't know where the pricing will shake out.  Even $1M may very well be conservative given the sheer relative complexity of SDC compared to, for example, flying an airplane (which is basically 100-year-old technology of wires and pulleys moving surfaces on the airfoils!).

3) having to both wait and walk out of your way at the start and end of your trip

5) having to conform to a sometimes inconvenient schedule

In most of the US, buses are horrible because the budget is limited, which means you get things like hourly frequencies, or peak-only service. When people compare ride-hail to buses, theyre thinking about a 7 minute wait vs a 50 minute wait. But if you have buses every 10 minutes or less, its sort of a wash. 

In terms of transformation, self-driving buses would allow many US cities to make the livability improvements that are common in Europe, such as downtown areas that are heavily pedestrianized with limited parking.

Exactly.  In the beginning, they put data center operators they were customers of out of business.  They contracted low, all-inclusive pricing, then installed as-yet-unheard-of system densities that required too much power and cooling for the datacenters to provide at profitable levels.  

The stories suggest this happened repeatedly, to any number of data center operators.  Eventually the data centers learned.  But by that time, Google had started building their own data centers, then their own motherboards, network hardware, and infrastructure.

&gt;  Waymo needed cars and they found two cars that fit their needs.

True.  Though they had to reach the bottom of automotive qualitative hierarchy before they found willing partners.  Scraping the bottom of the barrel as it were.

Presumably, the other, better automakers each refused to allow Waymo's Trojan horse into their castles.  

&gt; Then they also purchased some all electric SUVs with Jaguar.  What else could they have purchased instead?

There are electric SUVs coming from VW, Audi, Mercedes, Volvo, and others.  The Jaguar is here now, and it's reasonably priced, but Waymo won't be receiving most of them for a few years.

Suspect those other, less desperate automakers refused.  As well they should have.

&gt; Or a million other reasons.

Yes, hard to say.  It could be that Waymo feels confident that Magna can build cars to their specification more cheaply, giving them total control.

Electric vehicle subsystems are now being designed by all the tier one suppliers.  Building vehicles from those parts bins will be more than possible.  Of course, Waymo won't have an automaker's parts bin to rummage through, would could greatly save costs.

&gt; What did surprise me a little is Waymo did not make a run at Rivian but Amazon has.

What's surprised me is that they haven't made a run at GM.  They have more than enough cash on hand to swallow GM entirely.

Many of GM's liabilities were discharged in the bankruptcy.  They're a much leaner company than they were prior to 2008.

You can see a [complete list of all self driving car incidents in California here](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/autonomousveh_ol316+).

&gt; I think most companies are using LiDAR because they are trying to make a system that works. The downside is cost, so they are focusing on robotaxi services first to make it more affordable. 

GM and others have made it perfectly clear that [they see their future in managed autonomous taxi fleets](https://www.autotrader.com/car-shopping/autonomous-cars-ridesharing-key-gms-vision-future--254768), not consumer sales. And Waymo is definitely not looking to sell autonomous Pacifica minivans. They're all in on taxi fleets.

&gt; Tesla wants to sell cars today, but there aren’t any LiDAR sensors available that are cheap enough.

The article is very short and simple because it is only saying two things:

1. That Tesla is doing self-driving by deploying it at scale instead of in a trial environment, and that is unusual.

2. Driver assistance systems like Tesla's autopilot are more dangerous than driving without, and trade safety for convenience.

The first point is an assumption.  Like everyone else Tesla is not yet deploying the cool stuff.  The author is just assuming that when it is deployed, it will be useable in significantly less safe ways than everyone else, which is silly.  Phoenix is not some magical place where crashes don't happen and autopilot will turn off when it isn't confident.  And Tesla is hardly alone in deploying driver assistance to the public.

The second point is probably true, but its up in the air.  Autopilot has a better record than human drivers *in unweighted comparisons*.  There's much less convincing evidence that humans or autopilot are better on the highway because so few crashes per car-mile happen on the highway.  There's strong evidence people over-rely on driver assistance, but very little evidence that has any impact in practice.  If someone falls asleep using autopilot, there's no way to know for sure if they would have pulled over for a nap if they had been driving themselves.  The reality is also that we have already decided its okay to trade human lives for convenience; all else aside if we truly cared then cruise control causes the same losses in attention.

174,Reigningchamp4eva,"I would argue self driving is already viable if the software worked well. Lidar and cameras don’t cost that much compared to say a truck driver. In 1 year a self driving truck would be able to bring in 60k standard truck driving hours x3 or ~180k replaced. On top of that the incentive to have a truck deliver freight &gt;1,000 miles in 24 hours is huge and cannot be accomplished with humans alone (unless you have two truck drivers taking turns which is done rarely but at obviously much more cost). 

Given that you can replace the engine as needed etc and keep the system in place, your marginal maintenance cost is not likely to be super high in the system itself. Computer chips are already used for decades in high vibration environments etc. lidar would potentially be trickier but I haven’t heard of people replacing them that frequently. 

Either way you have 128-laser lidar at around 18k this summer, that’s enough for a taxi. Less than what an Uber driver makes in a year working 40 hours a week let alone 120. So for taxis I don’t see a huge issue already.

For trucks it’s even more lopsided. Say the system cost 100,000 (say 4 64-laser lidar at 48k total + like 40 cameras and 20,000 dollars of computer hardware for a total of like 100k installed/wired). That’s less than you’d make in your first year by far. Especially if you’re hauling oil which can make you 100k for 60 hours a week, you’d make 250k+ doing 160 hours a week + you’d be getting oil to market faster which itself carries a premium. 

For consumer lidar there is front facing lidar with 100 degrees fov with resolution approximately equivalent to 64-laser lidar in that specific field of view for around 1,000 dollars. It’s not 360, but I could see it allowing for far safer level 2 (or even potentially level 4 on the highway).

What do you mean by “better”?

&gt; I mean, theoretically I can see the advantage, but has a real advantage been irrefutably demonstrated?

The point, which it seems like you now understand, is that all of the computer vision work that Tesla is doing, the other companies are doing as well. The other companies just have another sensor input which has benefits that can’t be matched with vision only. 

As an aside, I do actually agree with Elon’s “crutch” description of LiDAR. Driving should be possible with vision only, but the big caveat is that we don’t have the computing power anywhere close to the human brain to make that possible today. 

So while companies are continuing their R&amp;D with vision/compute, they are using LiDAR to get there faster.

Also, the one death was a pedestrian. Most SDC test miles are non-highway miles, with lots of pedestrians and bikers etc. Whereas most (all?) of Autopilot miles so far are highways with no pedestrians, right?

I also think that fleet vehicles will will crush 300k mi. Current ICE taxis handle 500k mi, so an electric one might be looking at 600k mi with similar levels of maintenance (fewer moving parts, etc). They'll also get used up faster than even current cabs since they can run 24/7 which helps some as well, maybe bringing the lifespan up to 700k mi over a short 3 years. Which would be 7c/mi.

You of course have to add to that overhead for the system itself, road fees, taxes, electricity, maintenance, cleaning, etcetc. Then add in profit margins and inefficiencies.

Maybe more like 25c? 30c? 35c? Depends how crap the service is, how high utilization rates are. How short the avg trip is.

Still going to end up being around half the cost of ownership. Which is fine.

Even at double that, you're still going to be cheaper than a city bus today... Though more costly than a long distance bus. I think that is a pretty happy outcome. 

For comparison:

- Uber is around $1.50/mi
- Cabs are around $2.20/mi
- Bus is around $0.75/mi .... $3/trip (typically charge by trip rather than distance though so this is more variable. I guess a 4mi trip is around avg)
- Owned car is around $0.60/mi
- SDC fleet? 30c?

I also think that busses will spike in price. They need heavy use to keep those numbers down. And if SDCs eat that market, there will be fewer people to share that cost.

Of course there is evidence on complacency created by systems people believe to be self driving.  There are articles in the literature, and I have seen it myself.  Seen people fall asleep when warned not to do so.  Tesla itself admits (even promotes) the idea that those who have suffered accidents under autopilot were not holding the wheel in spite of all the warnings to do so.     That you can suggest there is no evidence for that baffles me.    What is less well understood and worthy of research is how much people do that, not whether they do it.

Tesla's numbers are incomplete and misleading.  For example, Tesla quotes accident rates with and without Autopilot on.  But Autopilot is, as Tesla declares, a freeway-only product, and while people use it off freeway, that's the bulk of their miles.   Yet it is widely known that the accident rate per mile on freeways is dramatically less than that on urban roads -- for fatalities it is half.     I have not found a reliable source for all accidents but my intuition is that the ratio there is even more favourable to highways, because highway accidents have more severity than non-highway.     Yet Tesla declares the ratio between autopilot and non-autopilot accidents is 1.8x better without mention of this extremely important detail.    Further, they publish their numbers on ""airbag deployed accidents"" (because that is what they log) and then compare it to the numbers for police reported accidents, when the former is almost surely a small subset of the latter.

Sadly, use of numbers like that can only rouse suspicion.

This is just your guess?  Because neither Alphabet, Waymo, or any of their principles have *ever* made a public statement to that effect.

Fair enough if that's your guess.  But please state it as such.

My guess is that it will be a tracking stock.  And yes, that there might be an ""IPO"" for that tracking stock, but my guess is that this will *not* result in Waymo transitioning into an independent, and independently traded firm.

&gt; What Alphabet is doing is NOT unusual

That's a straw man. I never said it was unusual.  My point was that it seems quite unlikely that they will IPO in the fashion you describe. 

&gt; Waymo employes are ONLY given shares in Waymo. They do NOT get shares of GOOG or GOOGL.

Yes.  Suspect the employees will be given tracking shares.   That too, is NOT unusual.

&gt; That is NOT the goal. Waymo revenue does NOT share the revenue breakdown of Google. 

Revenue diversification was *absolutely* the goal.  Not ""a"" goal, **THE** goal.  

Not only with the self-driving moonshot, but each of their other moonshots.  This has been repeatedly confirmed in discussions with Google insiders.

&gt; But realize the fastest growing part of Google today is NOT their ad generating revenues. 

Of course.  It's typically the small and new revenue sources that achieve rapid growth.  It's easy to quickly grow sectors that earn rounding errors of an overall revenue stream.  Sell 3 smart watches instead of 1.5 million.  100% growth year on year, but still a rounding error in overall revenue. 

It's far harder to *rapidly* grow an established segment that brings in over 100 billion per year and comprises 90% plus of overall revenue.

&gt; Waymo is ALREADY their own Corporate entity.

Waymo is NOT an *independent* corporate entity.  

Waymo is a fully owned SUBSIDIARY of the Alphabet  holding company.  No different from  	
Calico, CapitalG, Chronicle, DeepMind, Google, Google Fiber, Verily, and the rest.

Unless and until Waymo is fully spun out from under Alphabet's control, they will remain a subsidiary.  That has not yet happened.  It's not a point up for debate.  It is a fact. 

**To sum up:**  Your guess is that Waymo will be entirely spun out from under Alphabet's control, accompanied by an IPO.   My guess is that it will not happen.  That at best, there will be a tracking stock.  This because revenue diversification is too important for Alphabet to allow Waymo out from under Alphabet's folds.

That's not hyperbolic. 

The only thing that distinguishes self-driving is being able to be **reliably** safe without a driver in some domain. For example, highways, during the day, in fine weather. 

What Tesla did is to expand the domain from divided highways to (soon) city streets and to add some navigational support, but without improving **reliability** at all. The same exact crash scenario that occurred in 2016, just happened a few days ago, and Tesla cars on Autopilot continue to crash into firetrucks parking on the side of the road regularly.

Where's that demonstrable progress?

It will not be self driving (in the sense of not requiring a human driver) as long it is not reliable. 

&gt; I find it impossible to believe that they aren't making any progress applying machine learning to all that data based on what I know about machine learning (which I admit is high level)

1. as soon as one company starts rolling out widely, there will be enormous pressure for others to do so, or risk losing their billions of investment while trying to break into an established market.   

2. once a couple major cities have the system, it will become obvious how desirable the system will be. an uber-pool-like system where 2 or more groups share a vehicle is very likely to be cheaper than public transit (even buses), more convenient (nearly door-to-door), and more convenient (no need to walk 5min, wait 10min, transfer and wait 10min, walk 5 min to your destination), as you can get picked up either directly in front of your house or within a couple blocks.  

there is potential for issues in cities with grade-separated transit, as you will be pulling more people onto the roads, but every city with little or no grade separated transit will be begging for self driving shuttles to replace their buses. cities with metros/subways could potentially give the SDC companies an economic incentive for each person they deliver to the metro/subway. so maybe if you take the SDC shuttle to the subway, it's a totally free trip, but anywhere else it's Uber-like rates.",1552250317,ei8ar9s,t3_azebs1,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2019

The thing about the moon landing is we only had to do it once, or a handful of times...and there were deaths before we got there.  The thing about a self-driving car is it has to almost always work.  They're completely different problems from a risk assessment perspective.

Besides that, the amount of time (in man hours) and money put into the moon landing currently eclipses all of the efforts by all of the companies combined for making a self-driving car.  At its peak, the Apollo program had 400,000 (!!!) people working on it.  Compare that to Waymo or Cruise who have roughly 1,000 employees each.

You made the initial claim, so the burden of proof is on you. Beyond that, there is the significant difference that I have *asked* you for data. Finally there is the issue that your claim is an outright lie. I have provided data--namely how rare such events would be. What I haven't provided is sources, because this is Reddit, not a dissertation. I'm not going to footnote every comment. If you want a source for something I've said, ask. 

&gt;Your position is more extreme than mine

Absolutely false. Again, we know from a hundred years of human driving this is not a concern. Your position is that suddenly when such issues are reduced by an order of magnitude (if claims of self driving safety are to be believed) it will become a critical issue. 

Furthermore, by its very nature your claim is more extreme than mine. You've insisted something absolutely must happen. My claim is that it could or could not happen. More extreme claims require more evidence. 

&gt;A simple other example is: does the AI/FSD need to factor in data about where crashes have been more frequent and behave differently (such as slow down or shift slightly towards the center of the road if it’s in an area pedestrians often dart out from between cars).

These are best handled by things like lower speed limits and other solutions, just as they are today. Especially given the fact robotic drivers will be sharing the roads with human drivers for decades to come. 

At any rate those kinds of issues don't fit your disputed claim, which is that ""there is a need to make a decision on prioritizing among outcomes."" If you're changing your claim to just, ""people will continue to try and make the roads safer"" well no shit.

Yea... If you take the portion that it would be beneficial for... then take only the ones that can afford a 60-80k vehicle, then take out the ones that trust self driving, then take out the ones where there are real-time HD maps available on the highways near them, then take out the ones that Want something like this... you are left with a nice market.

&gt; Poople won't care about what kind of self driving car picks them up 

They care if they can fit in the car.  Currently my family couldn't take a Waymo to dinner.  Their 7 passenger car only sits 3 non-toddlers and I have a family of 5.  This is because the front two seats are unusable and will be as long as standard cars are used.  Even if they retrofit the cars and remove the steering wheels, I would prefer to take a car with better seating arrangement that is easier to socialize during a trip. 

There is also the ability to share rides.  The more capacity the cars have the more people can ride in them and the cheaper the ride can be. 

If I need to haul a lot of groceries, a piece of furniture or a bike, I'd like to be able to get it in the car easily.  This is technically possible as Shawn has done it but he felt he had to apologize to Waymo because it didn't really git and he got the ceiling dirty.  The ideal SDC should have a low height of entry and high head room.  You should really walk on rather than sit into the car.  This is important for older passengers and those with handicaps.

Finally there is the cost.  There is no need for all the interior complexity of a full passenger car.  A dedicated platform wouldn't have the need for 

&gt; especially this early in the industry.

The later they transition, the more costly.  If you transition when you've deployed a fleet of 200k cars to just a few cities then that is much better than when you have 1m.  It would be different if the new platform was seen as the ""low rent"" car in the fleet.  At least then you could phase the passenger cars out as the premium platform.  I don't think this will be the case as a dedicated platform should be a much nicer experience in every way.

I think you are being generous.  From what Shawn and others have reported, I'd say it's closer to 5%.

&gt; ...50 rides. That is still too unreliable to be a fully self driving taxi service with no safety driver. 

Agreed.  Not sure what the ""marketable"" number is.  I think it would have a lot to do with how it recovers.  Today most of the situations reported are unprotected left turns but you have to assume there other more problematic and rare situations.  If they can work out a recovery system where they simply take a different route for unprotected lefts, they can have that problem 1 in 5 trips and I think they could go to market.  I'm fine with an extra 2 minutes on a trip.  What I wouldn't be fine with is a trip where I had to get out and walk.  That should be a 1 in 2k to 5k trips event.

&gt;  I'm completely bullish on self-driving, but it seems to me like Tesla's approach might be absolutely genius.

It is a good market fit for sure.  They have a very marketable product that people are willing to spend $8k for and it works.

&gt; Whereas Waymo needs to get to a 100% with expensive sensors.

I don't think Waymo needs to be 100%, they just need to get to 1 in 2k or 5k trips without an event where you have to exit the car or wait a very long time to continue your trip.  I know this is very close to 100% but I thought it worth taking a guess at what is marketable.

&gt; It just seems like having the driver act as the safety driver is the only way to go for the foreseeable future and will let Tesla get ahead.

As others have said, I think these are completely separate markets.  Tesla is really trying to build an L5 car.  Given that L5 is all but impossible or at the very least decades off; they are just working toward L3.  There is nothing wrong with this strategy and one of the huge benefits is that they don't have to map.  Waymo has built an L4 car that can drive without you paying attention.  The downside is they have to basically qualify every inch of every road the car drives on.  Until we can achieve L5, this is the only known way to achieve that.

L3 like Tesla is aiming for is a huge benefit as long as everyone needs to own and drive cars. Cheap commercial L4 will change the world as we know it.",1552969016,eiut35j,t3_b2mmqp,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2019
302,WeldAE,"&gt; Waymo is barely level 4 today.

This is an interesting statement.  My initial reaction is to disagree with you and count the number of situations they handle, etc.  The more I think about it the more I think it stands as an accurate way to describe where Waymo is.  The only problem is does this make others that are further behind than Waymo NOT L4?

&gt; Not sure what the definition of FSD is

You, me and everyone else.  There are literally dozens of us.  I'm using the term pretty loosely to mean ""A car that is unlikely to kill you if you close your eyes for 30 minutes during a trip"".  Not exactly an SAE level but I think it's more useful.

&gt; As for communications, if your car relies on them than it is by definition not level 5 since there will always be situations where communications, smart intersections, and detailed maps won’t exist.

Are you implying FSD is L5?  Cause if that view takes hold then we need to invent a new term since L5 probably won't happen in my lifetime and I'd like to continue to discuss .....PSDs?

315,sdcsighted,"That’s interesting... can you share which companies? I believe you, and I believe them. I’d be curious to check out their DE reports.

But was Tesla one of those companies?

I think the consensus is that the 550 miles in 2016 were so they could produce a few demo videos. (Just Google “Tesla Autopilot Vimeo” to see the ones posted in 2016 if you haven’t seen them)

To me it seems like there are 2 options:

1. The features were L3-5 prototypes. So they had to report the miles they drove, and the disengagements they had.

2. The features were actually just L2. But they wanted everyone to think that they were L3-5, because that would be more exciting and generate more buzz. So they reported their miles and disengagements even though they didn’t have to, in order to appear legit L3-5. (If they didn’t, then when the DE reports came out a few months after the videos were posted, people would say, “Hey Tesla didn’t report any L3-5 testing or DE, so their demo videos must have been L2.”)

They also then lied in the first screen of the video:

&gt;The person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.

(Contrast that to the fine print about AP features even today.)

One of the videos was entitled “Full Self-Driving Hardware on All Teslas” and they wanted to create hype and make everyone think that they had this awesome feature that was just being tested and refined by R&amp;D. So go ahead and buy a car now because you’ll get this functionality soon as a software update!

And looking at the videos, you can see the car navigating stop signs, traffic lights, etc. Whereas I thought that traffic lights are not yet considered solved by Tesla today, even 2+ years later?

&gt;Contrary to what most people believe.... The Tesla Autopilot team has never said they plan on releasing L3/L4 features... even Musk who always says crazy things... has also never said L3/L4   (Though he has implied it several times... but that's just Musk which is not in sync with the actual Tesla AP team)

I think Tesla has always been intentionally vague and never mentioned SAE levels from what I can remember. 

But even if you believe Option 2 above, I think it’s splitting hairs. Clearly they are overhyping/misleading people at best, and outright lying at worst. 

They may not have said L3/4 explicitly, but they clearly wanted everyone to think L3/4. And side note, I think they did pivot away from this in the last year or so and backpedal and try to claim that FSD always meant L2. But this is what it used to say on the FSD order page in 2017:

&gt;The system is designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat.

Again, contrast that with what they say about AP in the manual, even today:

&gt;Warning: Navigate on Autopilot does not make driving autonomous. You must pay attention to the road, keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times, and remain aware of your navigation route.

&gt;Warning: Navigate on Autopilot may not recognize or detect oncoming vehicles, stationary objects, and special-use lanes such as those used exclusively for bikes, carpools, emergency vehicles, etc. Remain alert at all times and be prepared to take immediate action. Failure to do so can cause damage, injury or death.

Also see this quote from the FSD page in 2017:

&gt;Please note also that using a self-driving Tesla for car sharing and ride hailing for friends and family is fine, but doing so for revenue purposes will only be permissible on the Tesla Network, details of which will be released next year.

The only thing limiting it is the models right now. This is in contrast to back when the only lidar available was 75,000 where even if you had perfect code that could run on a pentium II somehow it still wouldn't be viable for consumer vehicles. But today everything else has declined in price.

&gt;Re: redundancy it still doesn't make any sense to me. Humans don't have redundant systems. 

Well all I know if is any consumer or commercial L3/L4 system announced or likely to be available soon currently has redundancy in these mentioned areas.   Also... I think a big reason is that the probability that an electronic brake controller would fail is greater than the probability of a human having a heart attack.  But having 2 EBC... the probability is many times lower than both.

&gt;but the cost of the sensors is not limiting it that's for sure.

I agree somewhat... I do think that say a L3 lane keeping systems may cost $3000 or so in sensors... and then that cost doubles several times as it is past to consumer.  finally I think that expensive of an option... would be put on a vehicle with starting cost of 40-60k....

And I think the amount of consumers willing to pay 50-90k+ for a self driving system that can only lane keep on certain roads in perfect conditions....

Is a very limited audience.

&gt;Now some companies might artificially restrict it to the S class or A8, but that doesn't mean a company like tesla won't offer it as an option on their 35k base car, as they do at present.

&gt; Also. when you buy a Tesla there is an option. called:  ""Fully self driving"" ... I think Tesla will deliver on this feature... only it is L2.

If this is true, then I am saying that they changed their roadmap and changed their definition of FSD sometime between Oct 2017 and today.

&gt; This could still be L2.  no action. required... vs no supervision required

I disagree. Bear with me here...

In Oct 2017, they are clearly saying that the design intention (of the future FSD feature) is that there is no action required by the driver:

&gt;The system is designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips **with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat.**

Now see the definition of “R” in OEDR from J3016:

&gt;... and executing an appropriate response to such objects and events (i.e., as needed to complete the DDT and/or DDT fallback).

Do you agree that “executing a response” would require some sort of “action” from the driver?

So on the flip side, if Tesla is saying that no action is required by the driver, then that means that they are not required to “execute a response to objects/events” right?

And if the driver is not required to “execute a response to objects/events” that means they are not responsible for “R” in OEDR, right? 

And if the driver is not responsible for “R” in OEDR, it means they are not responsible for completing OEDR, right?

And if the driver is not responsible for completing OEDR, then that means the feature is responsible for OEDR, right?

And if the feature is responsible for OEDR, then that means that there is no possible way for said feature to be L2, right?

And therefore to respond to your quote above, there is no possible way to have L2 with no action required by the driver.

323,mindless_snail,"&gt; Humans are incredible drivers. 100M miles between deaths in ALL conditions. 

If your standard of ""incredible driver"" means you haven't killed anyone, your standard sucks. The reason so few humans are killed in automobile accidents aren't because humans are good drivers, it's because cars are very safe - as long as you're in one in a collision, and not a bicyclist or pedestrian hit by a car.

It's absurd to use death rate as a measure of ""good at driving"" when ANY collision means someone was driving poorly. If every human wrecks their car into something every day but nobody dies, does that really mean humans are incredible drivers? No. It doesn't. That doesn't even make sense.

""Good at driving"" means you get to your destination on time without colliding with any other objects. Self-driving cars have already proven they can drive more miles than a human without having any kind of accident.

&gt; Let me know when SDCs can even begin to approach that level of performance.

That would be nearly impossible to figure out with any kind of statistical significance. Auto deaths are so incredibly rare that self-driving cars need to drive BILLIONS of miles a year to have any sort of confidence in the numbers - humans already drive around 3.2 trillion miles a year in the US. But like I said, deaths are poor standard to measure against if you're trying to decide how ""good"" or ""bad"" a driver is.",1553043783,eixay72,t1_eiw93ot,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2019
324,myDVacct,"&gt; It's absurd to use death rate as a measure of ""good at driving"" when ANY collision means someone was driving poorly.

The deaths caused by vehicles are well documented.  It's hard not to report one.  They are a clearly visible standard without ambiguity that people will actually care about.

If you want to use accidents, you first have to define what an accident is.  And then estimate how many go unreported.  And even by the ""accident"" metric, on average humans go about 165k miles without one (reported).  And in *ALL* conditions, unlike SDCs in ideal conditions.  So, again, let me know when SDCs can get anywhere near that.

&gt; Self-driving cars have already proven they can drive more miles than a human without having any kind of accident.

No, they haven't.  Where the hell did you get that idea?  It's clear that you've swallowed the hype.  You do realize that every SDC has a human ready to intervene, right?  And they do regularly.  And still only in *ideal* conditions.  The ""S"" in SDC stands for ""self"".  Until the car is driving itself, and is allowed to get into accidents by itself, whatever stats you're referring to are useless.  How many accidents and deaths would there be without that human safety driver?  You can't just ignore that and sum up all the miles in between failures and act like they're contiguous.  By that logic, humans drive trillions of miles every year without an accident (if you just ignore all the accidents and sum up the good miles).",1553046373,eixeis6,t1_eixay72,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2019

I think if anyone is trying to make money anytime soon, they're either in the wrong business or hoping to make a hasty exit via acquisition or IPO. I'm framing the path to profitability for a capable robotaxi venture on a roughly 20 year time horizon, for the whole industry, with a few caveats.

With the car industry, when managing big, expensive, complicated, risky projects, historically what they've done is spread the risk around, and that's what is going on right now in self driving cars. I can't keep track anymore of all the investments and partnerships that formed in the past few years between supposed competitors. 

I would never put all my chips on a company like Zoox, but if I were spreading my bets between 5 AV outfits, Zoox would be one of them. They can spend the next 10 years tinkering with their whacky engineering while running the real service with Toyota Highlanders. 

When times get tough there will be waves of consolidation sweeping through the industry that Zoox may or may not survive, but their Autonomous OS is very good and probably worth Zoox's current $3 billion valuation, even if the rest of Tim's original vision is a write-off. 

If they are successful in their vision, it will be because they've engineered a radically new robotic drive train to automotive grade reliability, and that opens up possibilities when you need something interesting to dream about while fighting in the trenches for another 10 to 20 years. Pulling it off is a long shot but if they do it, they'll be doing it without competition, because nobody else was willing to take the risk.

Adding more space slightly outside the current geofence is encouraging and likely means increase in the geofence.  But it doesn't imply any meaningful ramping up.  Say they go to 1500 vehicles and double the geofence this year.  Progress to be sure, but I personally still consider that a testing phase not a rollout phase.  If they were happy enough to truly roll out the product they should be expanding the geofence and cars continually.  

Rollout to me is actively expanding as quickly as possible.  Buying/outfitting cars as fast as they can get them and detailed mapping roads as fast as possible.  At that kind of rate of expansion maybe you get to the majority of the populated areas in 3-4 years.  My point is we do not seem anywhere close to this.  In 2018 with the annoucement by waymo of having a self driving service by the end of the year, I assumed this rollout would have started in 2019.  Perhaps I am wrong but it is looking very unlikely.  Maybe 2020, 2022, 2025 - but at some point when they are convinced they have ""solved"" the problem this rapid expansion will occur.

This is not a fair comparison... would I said Niche because I was talking about a 60-80k price range rather than 35... furthermore.  These people who. bought this option.... most likely would have bough a Tesla anyways... or would have bought a high end car anyways.

Although, I do agree with your points in general that there is some demand... I am apart of that demand... but unfortunately, all of the OEMs I talk to do not see this demand. ... as well with component suppliers and many other players in the industry..

Of course it is hard to measure demand for a product that doesn't exist yet.

&gt;Tesla is offering a full self driving solution capable of driving itself across the country autonomously eventually. That’s what they claim at least. How did you reach the conclusion that a car driving itself across the country with no one in it is level 2?

I think people’s timeline for self driving is being delayed by way too much (2 years? Come on). Reality is more like 6-12 months delay. 

I also think people thinking waymo was going to come to Nebraska are going to be waiting a while. Expect California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas etc to be blanketed in cars before they try to brave the Midwest or northeast. They will go for the lower hanging fruit first and foremost. 

There are a lot of things that need to happen before they start expanding rapidly to new areas imo:

1: eliminating safety drivers in areas mapped

2: expanding Waymo’s area in Phoenix. 

3: opening it up to the public (or at least a “beta” program where you apply and get approved in a week or two).

343,Mattsasa,"&gt;I think that’s only due to the costs of LiDAR and software, which will drop over time. It’s easier to add a $XX,XXX package to a more expensive car because it’s a smaller percentage. People looking at $20K cars likely aren’t going to be able to afford a $10K package, for example.

Agree.  However, there are people like me... who would only ever buy a used car. for $5-10k... but it a self driving feature I'd pay $80k for the vehicle.

&gt;Hmm source? I thought that margins for automakers now are around 10%?

The margins of the entire vehicle yes... But for an option.. such as a self driving package...  the margins on the option/package are very large.

I don't have any data sorry. But everyone tells me it is at least 50%.. and think like Super Cruise, I think that is like a $10,000 package with only forward camera and radars.

&gt;But even if true, that means that AP only costs Tesla $4K and they charge $8K for it. I was already factoring in the $8K. But instead of $22K budget for LiDAR + redundant actuation/power + possible compute, it might mean $11K. (Note that the $8K for cameras/radar/compute would likely come down by then too, freeing up more budget for the other stuff)

Yes good points.

&gt;Does Tesla cover the cell connection and data in their cars now included in the $8K, or maybe in the base vehicle price? Or do Tesla owners have to pay ongoing monthly fees? Honestly don’t know because I’m not familiar with it...

That’s not the issue. But lidar does help computers make sense of the world without resorting to stereo computer-vision for depth perception. 

That’s why lidar would have solved this issue.

352,Reigningchamp4eva,"Waymo riders haven’t needed to sign NDAs for 3-4 months now. Waymo limits the area, but everything within that area is fair game. It’s not like other sdc demos where they take reporters to places X Y and Z. It’s anywhere in the 100 square mile area. Now this is admittedly small, but it’s all in context. Manhattan for example is 23 square miles. I hope they expand this soon as it appears they are gearing up to do so imminently. 

I guess I don’t see why anyone would oppose lidar at this point. Maybe when it was 75,000 dollars a pop. But now that it’s more like ~4,000 for solid state 360 degree coverage with say 4-5/10 quality and 18,000 for 9/10 360 degree quality I don’t get the objection. Remember a taxi cab that can drive itself is basically worth 3 full time Uber drivers making 30-40k each annually. Similarly for a truck it’s worth more than 4 truck driver salaries annually as you could have things like 1 day ground shipping 800 miles away, which could be maybe equivalent of 250-350k (truck drivers often get health benefits). So for commercial uses it’s absolutely trivial.

And now that front facing lidar is 1,000 I think we should start seeing it on advanced driver assist platforms too. People pay 8k for FSD on a Tesla. I’m sure they would pay 9k if it actually worked ;). 

It’s true we don’t know for sure if waymo would have this issue, but considering the issue is the inability to discriminate the incoming obstacle as radar cannot work at high speed to detect stationary objects, and the fact that lidar’s largest strength is detecting the distance to objects, it hardly seems controversial to say it wouldn’t detect it at minimum. Now you can argue the model might still fuck it up, but I don’t see how lidar wouldn’t detect the concrete barrier - do you? 


I am guessing you’re a fan of the lidar-less approach Tesla is taking? While I do hope they succeed, I also wonder if musk actually feels lidar isn’t workable. Keep in mind there was no way to use lidar even if he wanted to when Tesla started offering their own driver-assist/maybe self-driving system.

There is more than just perception involved in self driving. The computer in the car can be determining bounding boxes of surrounding vehicles and reducing detected lane markings to vector form, also radar data is much lower bandwidth than raw video data. These things can be inputs to planning networks and higher level systems that decide how to manipulate the car controls. The intermediate data is absolutely useful and you can see differences in higher level behaviors on different versions of Tesla software.

That’s all I wanted to hear. It doesn’t matter that it was 3 years ago; this was your quote:

&gt;The Tesla Autopilot team has never said they plan on releasing L3/L4 features

Moving on to Tesla’s plans today...

&gt;And since then they have never made any such claims.  

&gt;Not 3 years ago, and definitely not now.

&gt;Well current and future features they have described as L2.

I should have just looked at the [current Tesla website](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot) earlier, we probably could have saved some time. They still say this about FSD today. It still sounds like L4 to me... do you read this and still think it could apply to L2?

&gt;All you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go. If you don’t say anything, the car will look at your calendar and take you there as the assumed destination or just home if nothing is on the calendar. Your Tesla will figure out the optimal route, navigate urban streets (even without lane markings), manage complex intersections with traffic lights, stop signs and roundabouts, and handle densely packed freeways with cars moving at high speed. When you arrive at your destination, simply step out at the entrance and your car will enter park seek mode, automatically search for a spot and park itself. A tap on your phone summons it back to you.

Haha c’mon man... the blog post is from “The Tesla Team.” If you are going to be that picky, you could also claim that the Tesla Autopilot/FSD Team has never said anything publicly about anything at all...

I’ll copy/paste the last paragraph from the Autopilot page again below:

&gt;The future use of these features without supervision is dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of experience, as well as regulatory approval, which may take longer in some jurisdictions. As these self-driving capabilities are introduced, your car will be continuously upgraded through over-the-air software updates.

Your response:

&gt;This paragraph is so wishy/washy. It doesn't suggest to me they are designing a system that would not need human supervision, nor planning on releasing such a system. Sounds a lot more like there is a possibility that if someday the system is so reliable they may allow for L4. And again they never make reference to an SAE level.

Also, you made the following comments earlier:

&gt;I am just saying in their current roadmap of what they are trying to achieve...  removing human supervision is not even on their map.

&gt;Right.  they also never said they would allow for the driver to stop supervising the system.

However, there is [another Tesla blog post](https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux) that says the following:

&gt;Even once the software is highly refined and far better than the average human driver, there will still be a significant time gap, varying widely by jurisdiction, before true self-driving is approved by regulators. We expect that worldwide regulatory approval will require something on the order of 6 billion miles (10 billion km). Current fleet learning is happening at just over 3 million miles (5 million km) per day.

&gt;When true self-driving is approved by regulators, it will mean that you will be able to summon your Tesla from pretty much anywhere. **Once it picks you up, you will be able to sleep, read or do anything else enroute to your destination.**

(Preemptive note: the above was a Tesla blog post written by Elon. But I think there is a pretty clear difference between a rogue Elon tweet from his phone while he’s high and/or sitting on the toilet, and an official blog post that is likely reviewed/approved by corporate lawyers. Just in case you wanted to make the argument that “Elon’s wacky ideas are not official Tesla policies.”)

It’s pretty clear that this second blog post is also talking about L4. And contrary to what you said, it was obviously on their current roadmap because they even gave an estimated timeline... 6B miles / 3M miles per day = 5.5 years. (That’s based on the size of the fleet in 2016, so as they add more cars, that 5.5 year estimate should actually go down.) 

With this additional context, do you still think the last paragraph from the Autopilot site is wishy washy? Do you still think that they are not designing a system that would not need human supervision nor planning on releasing such a system?

&gt;And on what the website is today.

&gt;I'd still say this is a L2 feature.

You conveniently ignored the other paragraph. Given all of the context above, how can this be L2?

If you asked people 10 years ago if you would pay a random guy to drive you around in his car you I bet 2/3rds of Americans might have said no.  And yet we have Uber and lift.  

Asking people now if they will ride in a self driving car is about the same as asking people would they ride on a flying car.  Neither exist.  Yes, Waymo seems to be close but not close enough to feel comfortable pulling the safety driver.  

Once we have a true self driving cars with no need to have a safety driver people will change their mind.  Especially once safety stats show it is much safer than a normal driver e.g. Waymo goes 100 billion miles between fatalities.  Right now all the public is seeing is Telsa self driving car runs into a barrier again.  Not great press but again not a self driving car.

411,WeldAE,"&gt; Nuro can handle two deliveries in a single run depending on size (aka 6-10 grocery bags per compartment or ~125lb).

This is good to know, everything I've heard in the past said they were single delivery per run.

&gt; It's worth noting that actual delivery companies themselves disagree with you, and are aggressively pursuing ""last-mile"" delivery robots.

Again with the ""Last Mile"" bit.  I'm not aware of anyone other than Nuro that is trying to do what they are which is small deliveries over long distances.  Everything else I've seen is max 1 mile and more like max 100 yards.  They are sidewalk robots that go very short distances.  So I disagree that the industry is all pushing Nuro's vision.  That said, Nuro has a WAY better vision than all these sidewalk robots.

&gt; If you think the average american household gets groceries 4x a week I literally don't even know what to say.

The [stats say about 2 trips](https://www.statista.com/statistics/251728/weekly-number-of-us-grocery-shopping-trips-per-household/).  If you think reducing the effort to get groceries won't increase this, I don't know what to say to you.

&gt; First - not everyone needs to be on a service for it to be viable.

Of course not and I accounted for that in my response where I said they could have a period of success when the market is small.  As soon as it scales past a certain point their model will be crushed.  I think this will happen quickly.

&gt;&gt;if Nuro can get their product working and scaled out across the US before Amazon or Walmart figures out how to reinvent the milk man they might have a chance of making at least some money.

&gt; Second, 60-70% of households go to the grocery store once a week or less.

This might be true but then the remaining 30%-40% must go 3 times per week.  My guess is that those households are larger and have less predictable food needs like those with families.  So my example holds true as my neighborhood is a suburban family neighborhood. The 30%-40% probably also represent 60%-70% of the money spent given how much more they buy considering they are buying for 5 people rather than 1 or 2.  So while not the only cohort to look at, it's a valid one.  I also wonder if they count picking up a small item at a convenience store like milk or bread as a grocery trip?

&gt; The argument humans are cheaper (in the first world) is so comically stupid. 

I honestly couldn't figure out your point in all of this.  I'm not pitting a human car agains a robot on equal terms.  I'm giving the human a HUGE advantage in that they can carry all the groceries for 600 homes in ~4 trips. Instead of proving the logistics of this, which is tricky; I simply totaled the cost of all the single trips and let you imagine how to staff a human fleet to serve 600 homes close together if given $750k to do it.  

The only advantage the robot has is that it can get you the groceries in ~60 minutes. I guess if I'm about to make dinner and forgot something I might use this but I'm paying probably 2x the cost of the item.  Getting in my car actually costs the same but the cost is deferred until the next time I get gas or perform maintenance on the car or sell it with more miles.  If I am using the service for my 1x, 2x, 4x per week major grocery purchase, I'm probably fine with scheduled delivery among one of 4 times per day, say between 8pm and 9pm.

&gt; If no one was investing in self-driving cars then I would have a hard time justifying SDC honestly.

This is a valid line of thought and is completely different that your appeal to authority before.  If multiple players are putting real money into something then you have to at least entertain the idea.  I'm good with the idea of robot delivery, just not the way Nuro is doing it.  I think Nuro is out on a limb by themselves in the area where I disagree with them.  They have proven themselves to be very competent on the tech side, I hope they don't fall down on the business model.

Another area I think they are wrong is in building a custom vehicle.  This is from someone which things Waymo's biggest mistake is NOT building a custom car.  The problem with Nuro doing it is that it gives them no competitive advantage while costing them a massive amount of money and time.",1553612624,ejf6ewf,t1_ejalzr6,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2019
412,Reigningchamp4eva,"Well “last-mile” is really variable. For example a new postmates robot rolling out this year (starting in Los Angeles) has a 25 mile range. They’re pursuing an interesting hybrid model where the robots both pick up food from restaurants and then are picked up by cars and dropped off in neighborhoods (and picked up again later). 

I can see some advantages of this. Uber eats already is encouraging consumers with discounts if they order after someone else in the area is also ordering food. If you could batch 3 deliveries in an area (and also have it so the human just has to spend 30 seconds to load and unload the bot in an approximate area) that saves a lot of time. The robot is fully autonomous, but does have a remote operator (supervising multiple presumably) that can intervene as needed.

So it’s not really last 1-mile. FedEx is another company pursuing “last-mile” delivery. The “range” of their robot is 8 miles, which may mean 8 miles or 16 miles (round trip). And before you ask, yes it can climb stairs.

Starship robots which are delivering food at many college campuses have a range of 4 miles. 

The best application is probably package delivery tbh. I can imagine a truck loaded up with 8 of these robots, drops each one off at their designated area, they each deliver packages for 3-4 hours, the truck goes back and picks up another 8 robots and drops them off etc. and of course at the end of the day picks them back up. And 8 miles is only the beginning. If it isn’t already 16 miles getting there would be as simple as a slightly larger battery pack. 

Yeah but more than half of people get groceries 1x a week or less. Remember nuro doesn’t need everyone (or even 50%) of people to be interested in their service for them to be profitable. If nuro “gets crushed” it will be from amazon or another larger company aggressively pursuing their same strategy with more capital, greater economies of scale and greater ability to weather losses until nuro goes out of business. However, I see nuro being acquired before that happens if it were to happen. If you want to throw a bunch of money at the problem it’s way easier to acquire a startup (not necessarily market leader) and fund them to success than to reinvent the wheel.

I go to the grocery store 3-4x a week but I live in a city so it’s a 5 minute walk and mostly a chance to stretch my legs a bit. My total is never more than 25 dollars. I’m sure they count any trip to a grocery store (not bodega) as a grocery trip. The question is probably “how often do you go to the grocery store”. 

Less than 10% of households are more than your typical nuclear family: https://www.statista.com/statistics/242189/disitribution-of-households-in-the-us-by-household-size/ and &gt;60% are 1-2 people. Families in America aren’t very large these days.


You gloss over the delivery time window a lot. Current delivery services that don’t offer narrow windows are generally disliked compared to on-demand ones like instacart. To deliver groceries with a large truck throughout the day you need to pack all frozen foods and groceries with expensive packaging and dry ice. This is not popular with consumers because of the environmental impact (seriously I am far from a person that thinks everything must be recycled but it’s like a 50/50 weight ratio in delivered goods to disposable containers) and of course the delivery company has to pay loads for the dry ice/packaging.

To some extent I agree with you re: custom vehicle. It would probably be easier to buy a van and retrofit it. However it is apparently much cheaper than vans to produce (makes sense as it’s far smaller). Initially they used self-driving priuses but have switched since December 2018 to nuro R1. 

I think there are some serious advantages to the R1 however:

1: weight. This thing is light! 1,500 lb. obviously material cost isn’t the only thing, but it stands to reason the cost of raw materials is substantially less than a sedan or certainly a van.

2: it’s electric. This makes maintenance far simpler, and operating costs far lower. Remember they’re only traveling around 25mph which is where EVs are waaaaay more efficient than gas cars. They can also idle for 5 minutes with no wasted fuel. 

3: dimensions. This thing is tiny! It’s about half the width and length of an SUV or large sedan. Since it doesn’t need large crumple zones (it’s never going to be traveling that fast) and it has no driver that allows for substantial space-savings not realized with a retrofit of existing vehicles.

4: safety. Since the nuro is so damn narrow (seriously look at it) it allows for substantially more time to avoid someone running into the street from the sidewalk. Since it’s electric it has a low center of gravity allowing for low risk of rollover. Since it’s a mere 1,500lb and only travels at 25 mph I imagine their stopping distance is insane. Probably on the order of 10-15 feet. 

In your example of a larger refrigerator truck they weigh well over upwards of 25,000lb apparently: https://www.commercialtrucktrader.com/listing/2019-HINO-268A-120465575 first truck I looked at. 

Now imagine a 1,500 (1,650 with groceries) nuro vs a 15,000-20,000+lb truck trying to stop and avoid hitting billy?

The nuro will not only be able to easily steer away (it has substantially more space between the vehicle and the curb) but also would be able to brake far faster, likely around 1/4 the stopping distance if not even more. The truck likely 40-60 feet by comparison.

So the nuro ends up being a far safer vehicle to drive around neighborhoods with kids playing in the street too. 

Finally the cost. What is the cost of the nuro vehicles? Who can really say, but they just raised 940 million dollars. I doubt the delta is more than 20k between the nuro and a regular vehicle and at this point they’re still largely focused on honing their technology. Once they take away follow cars and feel it’s up to snuff I doubt re-fitting existing cars (like waymo) is going to be cheaper than a reasonably large volume order for nuro delivery vehicles. In fact I’m pretty confident the nuro - at half the weight of most passenger cars - would be substantially cheaper than buying a passenger car and retrofitting it to hold groceries and other items in 2 secure packaging areas.

413,Reigningchamp4eva,"Well none of these other startups are delivering 100lb of groceries to you. So none of them compete with nuro really. However they do see utility in last-mile deliveries. 

The range of a lot of these bots is actually pretty workable even at a range of 2 miles (there and back). There are 133 incorporated cities with population densities &gt;10,000 per square mile and this is from 2010, so more now: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population_density a bot can deliver to ~4 square miles worth of customers. 

I wasn’t saying package delivery for nuro, although that could be useful for instance if someone wanted something like an office chair on short notice. I was saying for the rest of the bots. 

Running a single UPS style truck around the neighborhood isn’t the best option as it’s far less energy efficient. Dropping off smaller autonomous carriers is far more efficient. 1 truck can service an immense area in this manner (quickly dropping off 8 bots and going back to pick up more and drop them off in a different area etc). You’d also save an immense amount on vehicle maintenance costs. Probably why fedex is pursuing it after all. 

The fedex delivery robot doesn’t deliver a single package. Not sure where you got that idea. The other robots generally deliver food which are time-sensitive. The human competitor is Uber eats. So again not sure which bot you’re referring to but the bottom line is package delivering robots deliver a lot more than 1 package and the other robots aren’t competing with fedex at all. They’re competing with Uber eats or amazon now. 

What bad decisions have nuro made? 

Yes, nuro is competing with instacart, not peapod. Instacart is just a dude with a Honda Civic ubering your groceries over to you essentially. They don’t use large trucks because like nuro they’re on-demand.

I wasn’t referring to fuel cost there, but that’s also true. When compared to their actual competitors (on-demand grocery delivery) their fuel costs will be substantially less. And your school bus example is a great example of why a large truck isn’t a good fit for on-demand grocery delivery. Is a school bus more efficient at transporting 2 kids than a Prius? No.

The fact that a nuro vehicle weighs 1,500 lb (and is so small) is an indication that certainly the raw material cost of their vehicle is less than a standard sedan (which is what their competitors drive).

Electric cars have oodles of extra crap nuro doesn’t need. However nuro does benefit from the economies of scale in terms of battery pack pricing. 

The dimensions of nuro allow them to have an even larger margin of safety over say an autonomous UPS truck. Clearly autonomous vehicles aren’t perfect yet. Having a stopping distance of 10 feet and more time to react to children running around (given they have an extra 4 feet or so leeway compared to a truck) is a huge benefit over a stopping distance of 40 feet and minimal time to react. **In addition a single lidar can provide appropriate coverage whereas a full size vehicle would need to have side/back lidars for up-close imaging** this is huge. 

And yes, you can justify retrofitting existing vehicles initially, which they did. But now they’re rolling out their self-driving vehicles for all the reasons above.

In review: 

Their vehicle is less than half the weight of electric sedans, they don’t need to build out safety features (airbags/lower structural integrity requirements) as they have 0 passengers, they’re not paying for oodles of crap they don’t need and then having to retrofit cars, they give themselves a massive leg up when it comes to the ease of avoiding pedestrian collisions relative to regular cars, and they save a shitload on the cost of lidar because 1 lidar can appropriately image the surroundings (**a savings of ~36k**), they don’t pay for power they don’t need as they aren’t going over 25 mph. 


Their service is fast, on-demand delivery. They can get your groceries to you faster than you could. **Any service that offers anything other than on-demand delivery within an hour (likely less than 30 minutes sometimes) is not a competing service.**

I’m not really seeing the errors nuro is making here to be frank, and you haven’t really offered any except “why didn’t they retrofit vehicles” which they did, this is just phase 2. 

Nuro’s main competitors right now is amazon now delivery, Uber eats, instacart and postmates. Again, any “solution” with a UPS-sized truck already has lost.

A real demo would be to give a self-driving car to a real journalist for a reasonable length of time (say a week) without NDA or any other limit on reporting, without safety drivers, safety monitors, safety engineers, chaperones, concierges, or any other euphemism for  a safety driver, without any other employee in the car, and without a remote driver.

423,Reigningchamp4eva,"Sure I can’t predict they’re going to win the market - but I can predict a large UPS truck isn’t a better fit for on-demand delivery as their vehicles. If it were, Uber eats instacart postmates etc would be using them, but no one is because they’re about the worst vehicle you could use outside of a literal semi.

I know you think it’s a small market, but the incredible success of all these companies says otherwise. 

Just from a food delivery standpoint the market is 100B, and growing 15% a year - before autonomous vehicles drop costs further. 

While you might think it’s a small market, as you said, the market decides that. And it has decided you are wrong.

Holy crap, what aren’t you getting about Uber eats? It’s not in 3 hours, it’s NOW. Because you know, you’re hungry NOW. There is a 0% chance a UPS truck replaces this crap. You aren’t delivering 100 hamburgers in one go, and if you did no one would order again because they’d be super old. There is no “bulk delivery” of online made to order food. The whole point is that it’s FRESH. 

I understand you think you live in a dense area. However, you do not. You don’t even make the top 100. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population_density again, this product is not for low density suburbs, nor does it need to be.

I’m glad you brought up the fact that Uber eats is too expensive for you, mostly because Uber eats grossed over 2 billion Q3 2018, up 150% YoY. Someone’s ordering and it isn’t bill gates. Again, you aren’t in this demographic and don’t “get it”, but that’s ok. As you said, the market decides not you. All my tech friends use delivery services because they value their time. **How much is Uber eats? 6 dollars? Is your time worth 15 dollars an hour?** Or even 20? For 10s of millions of Americans the answer is no. Now imagine if the delivery fee were 3 dollars.

So they don’t take along 10 pizzas? I mean damn, the nuro could handle 10 pizzas easily. Probably 40! It’s almost as if there’s no use in large vehicles for on-demand delivery that can carry 500 pizzas!

What do you mean “ready-to-eat” meals, frozen food? Since that’s not getting cheaper. Hot restaurant food? Since then nuro will continue to succeed in this regard. 

**500k a year? That’s your threshold of low volume? Are you for real? Cheapest car off the top of my head is the Hyundai Accent, 15k MSRP. What are their sales this past year? Under 30k**: http://carsalesbase.com/us-car-sales-data/hyundai/hyundai-accent/

Nuro is not trying to haul 2,000 pounds of gravel, they want to specialize in on-demand delivery of goods. **Can you think of something someone might want immediately that is &gt;250lb? No? Well then it sounds like they’re the ones buying a sedan while you are advocating for the F450 because “you never know”.**

Nuro could also be useful for on-demand deliveries a la postmates. Some random flower shop isn’t going to be within a hub of UPS or fedex, nuro will be able to drive over, have the flower shop attendant put it inside, and then deliver it faster than you can. Other uses include hot food delivery. While smaller robots on sidewalks are great, they’re not going to be able to go 20 mph on the sidewalk. They also, well, need a sidewalk. Workable in many cities but not in dense suburbs. This is their main competition (someone driving out to a neighborhood and unleashing some bots) but again I think the time requirements of hot food make this iffy. 

It’s quite possible both could be used, sidewalk bots for deliveries within 1.5 miles and nuro for deliveries over that distance. 

You say it’s only really useful for grocery delivery. In fact it’s only really useful for on-demand delivery of goods - which is their market after all. Seems like an ideal problem to me.

**If a competitor buys an off the shelf EV they will need to spend about 35,000 dollars more on lidar than nuro does**, and they’ll also have to retrofit it which takes time too. It’s harder to make a larger vehicle self-driving than a narrower one. And you’ll need to make separate locking compartments in the car itself. The leaf you’re talking about is also used, and naturally won’t have the reliability of a new car. 

The weight of the car is important for safety reasons as well as being cheaper to produce. In addition it allows them to use cheaper motors and a smaller battery pack than normal cars (as does having a speed limit of 25 mph).

**You also, hilariously, did in fact put too many 0s in your fuel cost**. How many kwhr is the 2014 (or whatever) leaf battery pack? 24. What’s the cost of electricity in the US? 11 cents per kwhr. So ~2.50 for 100 miles, or 0.025 dollars per mile. Sooo, yeah, you did lol. 

Honestly you really don’t seem to know that much about this field. I’m not trying to be a jerk but from “you have to make at least 500k cars a year or else you’re low volume and you can’t build a car cost effectively” to only people making 7 figures value their time more than 15 dollars an hour to thinking bulk delivery of pizzas was a thing (you walked that back at least) to getting the fuel cost wrong.

This isn't necessarily how actual teams are architecting their cars, but some seem to be heading in that direction.  (See the ""force field"" tech)

&amp;#x200B;

Once you invest a huge amount of money and develop such an algorithm, you can deploy it everywhere.  At first in all first world countries, then as the cost of the hardware comes down, globally.

&amp;#x200B;

Your metrics should indicate super-human performance, gracefully handling a host of crazy (edge-case) scenarios, but I think a crucial question to answer when it comes to readiness is *""what happens when everything fails?""* All software fails eventually (see aerospace).

&amp;#x200B;

If you're a self-driving truck on a highway, driving 65MPH in the middle lane with 80,000 pounds of weight behind you, you cannot come to a stop in the middle of the lane if catastrophe strikes (your primary and second compute implodes, and power to your sensors die, for example). You must build an abundance of extra technology to handle that scenario gracefully. That is tough, and lengthens the timelines to driverless.

&amp;#x200B;

We believe retirement communities (and others like it) offer a clear path to handle software and hardware failure. We will do all we can to ever avoid it, but when it inevitably happens, we'll handle it gracefully and safely, because of the simpler and slower environment and how we've approached redundancy in our technology.

441,borisst,"&gt; Well it takes human driver in US to go somewhere between 50k and 200k miles before accident.

These numbers are averages, across all types of roads, all types of cars, all maintenance levels, all weather conditions, all times of day, and so on. There's a huge variability in these numbers. For example, the fatality rate per mile on rural roads is at least twice that of non-rural roads.

Waymo has modern, well maintained cars, driving in ideal conditions on specifically chosen wide suburban streets. The equivalent crash rate for human drivers would be a fraction of the average. Self-driving cars should compete with human drivers under the same conditions, not human drivers on far more difficult conditions.

&gt; So arguably when disengagement gets to that point then we are 'here' with some caveats.

A lot of caveats.

&gt; In 2015 Waymo was at every 1000 miles between disengagements, last year - every 11k miles. GM is a year behind. And everyone else is 2-5 years behind from what we know.

These are **reported** disengagements. Waymo, for example, only reports a fraction of disengagements. It has a secret process to decide which disengagement should be reported. by ""secret"" I mean that it has never been disclosed, [nor did any third party audit it](https://paloaltoonline.com/news/2018/11/28/safety-mixed-with-enthusiasm-at-waymo-meeting). Their disengagement reports are a marvel of obfuscation. Nuro, for their credit, [reports disengagements](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/7c622789-e41b-4f05-aac3-1a2e906c7c6a/Nuro.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=) as follows:

&gt; 1. Object perception: briefly lost track of lead vehicle resulting in planned trajectory with insufficient braking.

&gt; 2. Onboard map: map inaccuracy resulted in planned trajectory that would have contacted curb on right turn.

&gt; 3. Agent prediction: inadequate cyclist prediction leads to a planned right turn trajectory with inadequate yield.

&gt; 4.  Agent prediction: child riding scooter in road in cicles, lack of accurate prediciton results in planned trajectory with inadequate yield.

Waymo, on the other hand, is completely opaque when reporting the disengagements they do bother to [report](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/wcm/connect/d9a84b7d-e9a8-4a09-a5b8-eeca5477ace5/Waymo.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=):

&gt; 1. Disengage for unwanted maneuver of the vehicle that was undesirable under the circumstances.

&gt; 2. Disengage for a perception discrepancy for which a component of the vehicle's perception system failed to detect an object correctly.

&gt; 3. Disengage for a recklessly behaving road user.

I think it is a safe assumption that if they are actively hiding something, they have something to hide. I would treat any report very skeptically.

&gt; So if we assume that if rate of improvement of self-driving continued with the same pace Waymo (or whoever has best tech 3 years from now) gets to 100k between disengagements in 3 years and everyone else in 4+ years.

&gt; But if that rate slows down by half we're talking 6+ years. And so on

Even that is highly optimistic. When improving reliability of systems, the rule of thumb is that improvements get exponentially harder. If the disengagement rates goes down 10X, you now have to drive 10X the distance to encounter a disengagement, and so on. 

The main problem is that self-driving is still an open research problem. Nobody knows what will it take to solve it or when, and if, it will eventually be solved.",1553758248,ejk3omv,t1_ejirb7o,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2019
442,borisst,"&gt;  but at the same time the cars are also objectively driving themselves.

Not in any meaningful sense. 

Driving has two constraints that needs to be solved **together**:  (1) drive proficiently enough to reach the destination in a reasonable amount of time, and (2) maintain safety while doing so. Solving each one of these independently is (relatively) easy. The problem is solving both at the same time. 

And safety is the real problem, because an error that results in a fatality every, say, million miles is a complete and utter failure that will never be allowed on public roads without a safety driver. 

The presence a safety driver or two is a clear indication that they have yet to solve the self-driving problem.

&gt; So you could have a car that only gets “stuck” every hundred or two hundred miles before being bailed out, clearly not driverless but what was it doing for those 100-200 miles if not driving itself?

Driving is proficiency and safety together. A car that is capable of driving a mere 200 miles without an incident is not a self-driving car, it's a pointless curiosity.

&gt; The 2020 Mercedes s class is supposed to be level 3 for example. If they accept liability and the car won’t crash as long as you take over in ~5 seconds

For the purpose of discussion, I'd consider it self-driving if the driver does not have to monitor the car, but can be alerted by the system to take over in a reasonable amount of time. I think that 5 seconds in unrealistic, though. 

However, the 2018 Audio A8 was supposed to be level 3 as well. How about we discuss it when, and if, it happens.

That’s interesting, because [two years ago you said](https://qz.com/924212/what-it-really-costs-to-turn-a-car-into-a-self-driving-vehicle/) that the PC/hardware was only $5K:

Would love to hear a breakdown of the costs on the Voyage G2, or at least total cost today, though understandable if you don’t want to reveal that. With the VLS-128, is the total cost comparable/more than the Udacity cost from two years ago?

The argument for limiting speed limit is as invalid as the argument for limiting the number of cars on the road. In fact, most of the argument is an appeal to emotion. 

If anything, it's not the absolute speed that's the most dangerous; it's the relative speed. In that case, a car that's driving significantly slower than the regular traffic speed is as likely to cause accident than that driving significantly faster. Yet we don't see an argument for the minimum speed limit, thereby setting a safe speed range, which makes sense if you were to argue for speed limit in the first place.

Here's the key difference. This system allows a human to bypass some unforeseen weirdness. There's a cow sitting in the middle of the road and refuses to move. A human takes over, and decides that it's okay to drive one set of wheels on the sidewalk just a few feet to get around the cow. A computer is not allowed to drive on the sidewalk, but it's fine, just get past the cow and set it back to auto. It doesn't have to be a full system crash. Just get around the weirdness causing the problem, or if that can't be done, call a tow truck. 

Here's what's not okay. Having an unreliable remote system in charge when you need _constant_ monitoring. If a human is driving at 10mph and it loses connection, nbd, just stop. If a human is driving at 60mpg and the connection drops (and it _will_ drop), there's a lot that can go wrong in a second. Do you slam on the brakes on the highway?

In August 2017, the New York Times put out a [big article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/technology/apple-self-driving-car.html?_r=0&amp;mtrref=t.co) claiming Project Titan was in disarray, and that they were scaling back it's vehicle manufacturing efforts. Many didn't read the article carefully and took it to mean Apple had shuttered it's vehicle design efforts and was only focusing on Autonomy, but really Apple was just regrouping and setting the project along more realistic timelines. Apple at the time didn't know much about cars and knew even less about autonomy, and they got overzealous.

It appears most likely at this point that Apple wants to have their vehicles built by a contract manufacturer, likely Magna-Steyer, but there are also asian companies willing to do the same. Apple also has [some kind of arrangement with VW](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17387214/apple-volkswagen-partnership-self-driving-cars-project-titan), where possibly VW will provide Apple with vehicles Apple may use as part of it's autonomous pilot project which is intended to shuttle Apple employees between various Apple buildings, and this VW partnership may or may not represent the seeds of something more substantial down the road.

If Apple is exclusively dedicated to robotaxis, then I don't foresee them having any kind of vehicle mass produced within 5 years, and more likely longer than that. The thing is Apple may not be exclusively dedicated to robotaxis, and they may also still be planning to make and sell vehicles for private use, which would allow them to get something on the market sooner, and with greater certainty, given that they've invested so much money and manpower, and that the outcome for their full autonomy development is uncertain (as it is for everyone).

Your comment completely misses the point about Apple's project. Apple would have launched an electric car already, without Tesla, if it wanted to.
 
Their original plan was to launch an electric car around 2020. The car would have some self-driving capabilities just like Tesla. They changed direction in 2016 and decided to put more focus on autonomous driving.

Apple has observed that transportation as a service is the future. Tim Cook has said multiple times that electrification, autonomous driving and ride sharing are going to be disruptive. They also invested $1 billion in didi that year.

If you are to fault Apple at something, it should be on not initially seeing the potential of services like Uber and Lyft. However, it looks like they made a quick turn in 2016 which is impressive considering their size and the money they had already spent on the project.",1554045206,ejt3ekr,t1_ejsrmsm,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw,2019

472,userndj,"&gt; Why would they need to change direction?

The original plan was to differentiate themselves through hardware, they were said to have even tried to reinvent the wheel. Designers insisted that autonomous driving was the only way if they were to rethink the car experience. This meant Apple had to put more emphasis on software, self-driving is a HUGE task of its own. This approach meant they can't add autonomous driving ""later"" like Tesla is doing.

&gt; The engineers involved with making the car and the ones involved with self driving are different.

That's exactly what they are doing, but with obviously less emphasis on hardware than originally planned. Software and services is where the disruption is going to happen, just like with the original iPhone.

&gt; Previously I worked at Waymo for a year on the perception module of the self driving car. Based on what I know about the state of the art of computer vision, I can pretty much guarantee that current Tesla cars will never be autonomous. This is probably a huge risk for the investors of Tesla, because currently Tesla is selling a fully-autonomous option on its car which will never happen with current hardware. We need several breakthroughs in computer vision for no-fail image based object detection, and you will need higher resolution cameras, and much much more compute power to be able to process all the images. It's hard to estimate when we will reach that level of advancement in computer vision, my most optimistic wild guess is 10-20 years. And then Tesla will need to upgrade all those cameras and install a dedicated TPU which should be at least 10x or probably more faster than the nVidia chip they have installed on their cars, and they should do it for zero dollars because they have already sold the option.

Of course, there's an XKCD about this that gets pasted here often: https://xkcd.com/1958/

That being said, relying purely on computer vision for self-driving cars is still scary because of accidental ""hacks"", like if a paint can falls off a truck and sprays a line across the road. A person was already killed when their Tesla rammed into a divider and there are reports of it happening to other folks who catch it in time.

All of the serious self-driving car projects aren't vulnerable to this type of thing because they also rely on very high resolution 3d maps of the areas they can drive in. They use the cameras and LIDAR (and GPS, etc) to figure out exactly where they are on the map and they won't randomly stray off of the road because of a new line. If a road is reconfigured because of construction, the car will just stop and let the safety driver take over.
