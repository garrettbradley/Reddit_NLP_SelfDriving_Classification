Yes, it is something you want, not need: much like heated seats, GPS, a back-up camera, A/C, self-parking and someday self-driving.  These features get added with time, and if we demand them, production will drive costs down (look at hard drive costs in the past 3 years alone).

Permanent magnets for levitation definitely, otherwise a lot of energy would be wasted there, or if superconductive, for keeping it cold.

Regarding energy, if the almost zero friction in almost vacuum works well, I think you don't need much energy for maintaining the propulsion. Accelerate the train for instance the first 10 miles to 3-4 Mach and decelarate the train for the last 10 miles, when the train works as a maglev generator and the energy is restored. To maintain the speed under almost zero friction means very little energy and thus very little heat. The energy for maintained speed could possibly be stored on the train, alternatively be charged through a high voltage, low current connection. Each of the modules, I foresee that the tunnel is built using equal high tech mass manufactured sections that are produced at a few locations over the Earth, move themselves to the right places either over land or water, and dock with their friends, and fix themselves to the bottom.

Each module could be maybe 100m*20m in size, containing solar power stations, super capacitors, maintainence intelligence and such. I would like to see each module section as an autonomous robot. The more I think about it, the more realistic it seems.

I see some practical problems in implementing efficient routing systems though, but preferably the trains are never leaving their tunnels, only going back and forth one route, except for changing track of course, which can be done without letting any air in, otherwise you wouldn't be able to have multiple trains on the go to the same destination. I anticipate that the trains are filled with things like containers and your personal transportation devices. That is, you should be able to go straight from your home in e.g. New York or Palo Alto with your (self driving of course) transportation device when you tell the computer that you are going to e.g. Madras in India or Hong Kong you are then taken automatically without need to go out of the vehicle the whole way to your final destination through a set of different trains, and then taken automatically to your destination address. OK, apart from the technical problems which are not too hard, you of course also have a few political issues (like world peace, world union and such) that need to be solved, before you can move freely between countries. On the other hand I'm quite an optimist (85%) and I think most of these issues will be solved during the time we work on  the technical and economical issues.

Because the Tesla is marketed as a $100K sports car and serves that function.

Because it's a people-carrier, at the end of the day. A 4-door sedan, if you will. 

&gt;How much do you want to bet than the true cost of an FCX is far more than a Tesla?

I don't really see your point. The true cost of a Prius is *MUCH* higher than a Ford F-150 (when you factor in the energy costs, pollution, financial costs of importing the batteries etc), but doesn't make the F-150 a better car?


&gt;while ignoring their own smug self-satisfaction at driving expensive cars

Prius drivers are *SMUG* - that's a fairly established fact. I could still get more mileage out of a '70s Porsche than you can out of a Prius. 
What has the cost of the car have to do with anything? A Model-T probably costs close to a million dollars now, but will still get you 50+ mpg. Take that up your Prius and shove it. 

&gt;Notice they didn't drive both IN THE CITY AT NORMAL SPEEDS

Your argument is so utterly ridiculous, I want to throw my shoe at you. And yes, I wear expensive shoes while ignoring my own smug self-satisfaction. 
The majority of the American population lives in the suburbs, *NOT IN THE CITY*. Suburbs = vast expanses = big highways connecting any 2 popular points. Average speed on the highway - anywhere between 55-75 mph. At which speed, the Prius runs on gas ANYWAY. Hence, in *usual* driving conditions, you are comparing a manual-gearbox M3 to an, arguably undermatched, auto-gearbox Prius. 

&gt;Face it you mindless critics, even with the ""adjusted"" EPA methodology, the Prius is still the most fuel efficient car you can buy

Oh, I beg to differ. My colleague's Jetta diesel runs way more efficiently than a Prius. As does most of Mercedes' BlueTec range. I could mention the Fiat 500 or the Panda - but you get it.

One thing I've learned from my years of AI research is that computers are very good at specific tasks, but incredibly brittle when forced into unfamiliar domains. In other words, you can outfit a car with enough sensors to safely stay on the road, but it won't know to slow down in a residential area if a small red ball goes bounding across the road.

&gt;What about people who will use this to play games and joy ride? You don't think someone will mount some more cameras, override it with a joystick, and put it on YouTube? They'd get away with it too.

Um..if you override the self-driving, then it's not longer self driving.  The point of making a self-driving car is not simply that the car can be operated without a human sitting in the driver's seat; that can already be done.  If someone has the time (and very little money) they can take their car now and make it a ""remote controlled 2-3 ton weapon.""

&gt;I know, I'm speculating hard and being very imaginative or hysterical here

The author is being astoundingly hysterical here.  Nearly all of the 'bad things' that the author brings up can already happen; they are entirely unrelated to having a piece of software that is able to perform the object-recognition tasks necessary to allow a car to accurately place itself in the world.  That's the big thing that google is trying to do.

From the OP's other comments: ""I just don't think this technology will prevent all accidents.""  Probably not.  But the cool thing about technology is that you can ~make it better~  You'll notice that current laws do nothing to make people better drivers.  So long as you aren't drunk, you're free to be a terrible driver all you want, and there's nothing to force you to get better.  

Google admits that today's computers aren't nearly reliable enough for driving safely.  So you know what?  They're working to ~make them better~.  You won't see that happen with people.  Someone quoted ~30,000 people dying each year from car crashes.  But that's just become an accepted number, a risk that you take when you go drive.

They don't need to go and buy extra equipment and know electronics and computer engineering to create this ""weapon"" anymore because it would be much easier to do so.

I know the author does sound like he's exaggerating, but I can see a world where these dangers can exist.

The problem is, technology becomes better, but in programming, software changes in complex systems always introduce new bugs. In a system such as driving in an unknown environment you have many unknown variables. To top it off, testing all features becomes a difficult task. 

Maybe a bug will be discovered but fixing it, testing it, and releasing it to all cars to fix that bug would be enough to kill thousands of people on the roads.

I can't believe you would trust a piece of software to do your driving for you. I'm a programmer, I love technology, and I don't 100% trust my car now with all the microchips already in it, but hey, at least the microchips in cars today are separated into single modules with single functions, but once you put in self-driving AI, it becomes a combined system where multiple systems interact and can cause unpredictable results.

About 20-30 years from now I predict that 99.9% of the cars on the road will likely be self-driving.

But from there the car companies could update the firmware on all the cars simultaneously to safely drive without regard for traffic lights or road signs, which would result in even less congestion and faster traffic, especially if the autonomous cars could coordinate decisions via wifi.

Shortly after that I predict that some prankster will figure out how to abuse any auto-update system or ad-hoc communication that is in place for these cars and make a worm that tells the cars to drive in reverse as they travel to their destinations (but keeping the safety and crash-avoidance systems in place).

But yes, it seems more likely that we'll eventually have cars that are connected to each other, to the road they are on, aware of their locations via GPS and communicating with a central traffic control computer that will give most of the benefits of rail if not all of them; cars still need self-contained power sources, and right now they are either impractically small (electric cars) or polluting.

After getting off the train from downtown, or getting to the airport after a vacation, you could just summon your car to come pick you up.

No more need for street parking for anyone, especially metered.  Just have your car go to the nearest free parking lot with openings, or metered parking lots within your price limits.  Parking downtown would no longer cost $20 for the day.

Need an oil change later?  Just arrange it with the shop, and they'll summon it during the work day when it's otherwise just going to be in the driveway.

PRT without dedicated right of way is simply self-driving cars, which may work. But only if they use existing roads and co-exist with human-driven cars.

What are you going to do when a plane lands on the highway in front of you and the car's software has zero conception of what's going on?
Yeah, you can add a fallback plan to deal with an unexpected obstacle(eg: Oncoming car, landslide blocking the road, semi truck with dead breaks steamrolling up behind you, etc.) such as stopping or leaving the road or trying to dodge while staying on the road, but these default actions are by nature not likely to be as flexible as a human in dealing with the completely unexpected.

No question that you can make a computer drive infinitely better than humans in an idealized situation or one that only deviates from the norm to a certain point, but sudden and odd situations are going to require human intervention for a long, long time.

* **Self-parking**: You stop where you want to park, and just click a spot on a screen - boom, no matter how tiny the spot is, the car will just park itself while you get your things ready. I know many people who love to drive, but I don't think I know one that likes to park.

* **Accident prevention**: Imagine this as a selling point to a parent buying his teenager a first car - ""If the car detects you are about to get into an accident, it switches to automatic mode in the last few seconds it can to prevent it. No accidents. Of course this would make some drivers even more reckless, since they believe they cannot ever crash, and might cause accidents with the people around you that are not expecting a crazy teenager testing the limits on his new accident free automobile. So soon new legislation would force the prevention limit to be up (it doesn't verge on the last second, but prevents it from speeding it up too much) and soon you would have ""teenager cars"" that were legislated never to go out the speed limit.  As those teenagers grow, they get used to have a car with cruise control.

* **soft-control** imagine a car that instead of obeying you directly, uses your input as a guide. It obeys your commands, but more in the sense of ""snap to grid. You ask to turn left and instead of there being a direct control driving wheel - wheels, there's a more subtle ""go left, go right"". Maybe there's even a force feedback on the driving wheel so you will feel the car self correct if you make the turn too sharp or if the car is going to hit a wall.

58,Not_Edward_Bernays,"A couple things that I think that will make it more realistic would be communications systems between cars and LIDAR so the vehicle would have an internal picture of traffic around it for safety.  

It might be easier to first push for vehicles that communicate and have an inner picture of the road and other vehicles, so they could say let you know when another vehicle approaching and could interfere with a merge, or show an image of traffic around and behind you.  

This communication system could be integrated with LIDAR or whatever so that the reported vehicles positions and movements could be verified.

So not only would it let you know but perhaps prevent you from merging over if there was really going to be a collision.  

There could be another incremental advance that ties into the nav system and will automatically merge over when its time to exit the freeway or turn.  Then they could take the next step of having the car take the exit or turn on its own.

You could create an electronic vehicle safety rating system that would allow manufacturers with enhanced electronic safety features like communications between cars and LIDAR to advertise as being safer.  So a car that was pretty much ready to drive itself would have an A+ rating, and one with just basic range sensor might be a C-.  That way there is a monetary incentive for manufacturers to start rolling out these self-driving features incrementally.

Computers can't make decisions at all, but can only follow logic written by a human on how to recognize and handle different types of situations.  There are tons of issues with this that as of yet, have not been addressed:

1.  Automated cars are designed to take you to a destination, but that isn't always what I want to do.  Sometimes I might want to go for a drive.  While that may not make sense with an automated car, say your on vacation, and want to cruise around doing sightseeing and stop when you see something interesting.  How would an automated car do this?  Sometimes I need to haul stuff with a truck, which means I need it parked at a specific place, in a specific direction to load and unload stuff.  Programming a navigation system to do that would be completely impractical.  Sometimes I want to stop somewhere, or drive less than a mile.  Programming the navigation system to do that would take much longer than doing it myself.

2.  GPS Navigation is still bad.  It usually gets the destination wrong by a couple hundred feet to over a mile.  I don't want to walk a mile, unless that's what I intend to do.  (My parents house on GPS is wrong by over a mile so don't try to tell me I'm wrong).

3.  Complexity and bugs:  There's a reason why we don't already have autonomous cars:  AI systems are complicated and buggy, and a real-world self driving car system has many layers, and many opportunities for failure.

4.  Cameras and Lidar must have clean sensors to work.  What happens when it gets splashed with mud?

5.  Failures:  Engine computers are not able to recognize the vast majority of things that can go wrong in a car, including: flat tires, broken axles, transmission issues (mine can't), or even a serious engine issue like a broken timing belt (mine can't).  In addition, they can't determine the scope of the issue, and determine whether to keep trying to get to the destination or pull over immediately.  Google doesn't have problems because they use new cars for all of their tests.  Wait until the car is 12 years old and see how well all of this works.

Law to apply and the singularity to occur circa 2045, the advances in capability have to occur not only in a computer's hardware technologies (memory, processing power, bus speed, etc.) but also in the software we create to run on these more capable computers. To achieve the singularity, it isn't enough to just run today's software faster. We would also need to build smarter and more capable software programs. Creating this kind of advanced software requires a prior scientific understanding of the foundations of human cognition, and we are just scraping the surface of this.
It certainly doesn't appear that the rate of hardware speed improvements is slowing down in any way. Not only are we getting more and more out of silicone chips, there are already a number of technologies lined ups, such as graphene, memrisots, and spintronics, which don't require any fundamental breakthroughs. They're already known to us, and simply need to be put into mass production, in case of memristors, it looks like it will happen within a few years.
As far as software goes, there are also tons of advancements in that area. Projects like MoNETA are rethinking how the computers operate. Then there are people like Jeff Hawkins who are searching for the model of the mind. Numenta, which is founded by Hawkins, produces neural networks based on this model, which are successfully used for a range of applications.
There's no lack of progress in either of these fronts in my opinion.
This prior need to understand the basic science of cognition is where the ""singularity is near"" arguments fail to persuade us. It is true that computer hardware technology can develop amazingly quickly once we have a solid scientific framework and adequate economic incentives.
The economic incentive is most certainly present for development of strong AI systems, these are applicable in practically every market, from medicine, to self driving vehicles, to stock market. A lot of money is being devoted to producing ever more sophisticated intelligent agents and coming up with new techniques for making them.
Building the complex software that would allow the singularity to happen requires us to first have a detailed scientific understanding of how the human brain works that we can use as an architectural guide, or else create it all de novo
Andrew Ng has [an excellent presentation]((http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY4ajbu_G3k) on the topic. While we're not quite there yet, we're certainly making steady progress in this direction.
This means not just knowing the physical structure of the brain, but also how the brain reacts and changes, and how billions of parallel neuron interactions can result in human consciousness and original thought.
This is simply absurd, we have understood many other organs without knowing every single detail about them. You don't need to know how each blood vessel in the heart is connected to the other, to understand how the heart works. Similarly, we don't need to understand every intricate detail of the implementation of the brain, to understand the principle behind it. It seems like he can't see the forest for the trees.
But history tells us that the process of original scientific discovery just doesn't behave this way, especially in complex areas like neuroscience, nuclear fusion, or cancer research.
Actually, it appears that scientific and technological progress behaves exactly like that. ZobaTHut, makes an excellent point in that regard.
Just think about what is required to thoroughly understand the human brain at a micro level. The complexity of the brain is simply awesome.
Again, he focuses on the details as opposed to the big picture. While we don't know everything about the brain at the micro level, we already have a sophisticated understanding of how parts of the brain work and interact with one another. Our models of the brain are becoming increasingly more accurate and are already resulting in things like an artificial hippocampus.
Finally, we do not need to understand the whole brain, we simply need to understand how parts which we find interesting operate. This reduces the scope of the problem significantly.",1318525146,c2r76m6,t1_c2r6960,technology,t5_2qh16,2011

Researchers have made great strides, and have put their ideas into practice, albeit in limited form (due to the limitations of current computing) in machines like Watson or Google's self-driving car. 

Unfortunately, theories about how the brain works are incredibly complex because the brain is a complex, multi-component machine. Which makes sense, because it's a haphazard collection of modules assembled through millions of years of evolution based on what worked at the time. It's not like physics, where you can reduce the entire thing to a handful of equations. It's more like a software project that has been hacked and re-hacked over and over again until it's millions of lines of code. In short, the brain is complex and it's foolish to think a single ground-breaking idea would suddenly 'click' and explain how we think. Nevertheless, even though we might not understand the details (why the f%$&amp; is there a if(number.isZero(a)==number.Yes) instead of just if(a) ???) we understand how to write programs that emulate it's functionalities, and we understand this *well*, you just have to browse through research-level brain, neuroscience, and computing literature.

138,chronographer,"This is my understanding on how Google's self driving cars work:

They use a laser scanner to get 3D data on the world around them. They also have an apriori model of the world (they have a 3D model they prepared earlier).

The 3D laser scanner data is fed into an object recognition algorithm and this puts boxes around things, such as cars and people, and also picks up parts of the world that are ephemeral - things that change.

They use the 3D model of the world along with a trip plan to work out exactly where the car will drive, they make a vector path that the car needs to stay within. Like a ribon on the virtual earth, which the car will follow. If an object strays within this ribbon, the ribbon must move, or the car stops until the path is clear.

Part of the model of the world is data on traffic lights, so they watch where they expect them to be, find them, and then see whether they are red or green and obey them.

Finally, there is the car driving logic. This bit is easy. Accelerate, Brake, turn.

Interestingly, they use GPS for coarse positioning of the car, but then use [SLAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) for more precise positioning. SLAM works by saying 'look at objects near me', 'find similar ones in the model of the world I already have', 'match them up and use that information to tell me where I am'.",1319154229,c2t52sg,t1_c2slf4h,technology,t5_2qh16,2011

It would be a serious logical mistake to assume that just because some so-called AI junk was pushed into a market where it failed, that means the whole idea of heuristic learning is bogus.

Look at the cutting-edge research in learning, such as the success in self-driving cars (Darpa grand challenge, Google's driverless car etc).   As someone else said in this thread, as soon as a problem is solved by computer science, it is reclassified as ""not as hard as we thought"".  Talk about bias!   Chess, driving, trivia --- it all seems simple once you get it right.

The premise of strong AI advocates (such as myself) is simply that this stuff is really, really complex, but is tractable using digital computers.  Analog computation is a red herring, and doesn't really hold up to scrutiny.  There's a great paper about how people thought that bubbles and wire could solve intractable problems, but it turns out this 'analog computation' was no better than a well thought out digital algorithm.  I'll try to dig it up if you're interested.

Good discussion though.

The biggest problem right now, seems to be that most people simply do not understand this technology, what it does, how it does it, and how utterly good it is compared to human drivers. And they start freaking out about taxi drivers losing their jobs and such, or about losing the ""joy of driving"".. As evident in th

My problem with that is, I simply cannot comprehend how anyone can feel those things outweigh the benefits of driverless cars. The loss of human life from car accidents is utterly unacceptable. Even for the best human drivers, it only takes a split second to end up in a fatal accident. Nevermind all the idiots on the roads, and drunks, and raging assholes.

Once self driving cars are commercially available, it wont take long for the benefits to be widely known. It will start out as a luxury feature, but will quickly become a necessary safety feature. Maybe it will even be legally required in some areas.. Or even illegal to drive manually.

Although maybe for those people who *want* to drive manually, it could be used as a backup safety feature. The moment the car detects an accident is about to occur, it could instantly take over control to ensure the best possible outcome.

If you enjoy driving, that's fine - go to a race track or some other enclosed area and drive all you want. There are many things we don't let people do in public because they're unsafe though, and driving should be one of them. 

Though it should be said I don't think self-driving cars are a solution to anything, primarily because they still have many of the flaws that current-day cars do - they run on rubber tires on an ever-shifting surface that is sensitive to weather, like rain, snow and ice, which is bad. They also require self-contained power, which is also pretty inefficient. 

They're also faced with the major challenge of dealing with the still irrational humans who will be driving where they are driving - I have no doubt that if any automated cars get into accidents it's because some more or less loony human did something nuts, the way humans are wont to do.

What we need is to keep the part where we do away with human pilots, because people suck at driving, even the best drivers are prone to health issues, have glacially slow reaction times and are influenced by anything from fatigue to anger to hamper their driving skills. 

What we still need to change is the concept of using roads and steerable vehicles in the first place.

But I can't help think about the potential additional services that this technology could bring us, as well as changes to the landscape.

Of course, part of this is simply the sheer amount of wasted time I've experienced trying to get a ride after dropping my car off for repairs, and then trying to get a ride back to pick it up.

Taxi service, for example, is really expensive, but largely because human time is expensive.  The driver has to make a living.  Eliminate the need for a driver, and a taxi service cost could drop a lot.

Street parking will vanish because everyone will send their cars to cheap parking lots.  Parking structures will be constructed in lower cost areas, but be able to hold many more cars, because they will have a wider area market if they are cheap.  I can see sending my car 2-3 miles away to park from where I work.

Traffic may clear up downtown by eliminating the people driving around looking for addresses or street parking.

Insurance rates will drop like crazy, because accidents will virtually disappear, which also means health insurance will drop at least somewhat.

Those services that time share vehicles will boom.  Why own a car downtown if you only use one once a week to visit mum out in the suburbs or to pick up groceries, if you can order a car to come pick you up.

Google, and many other companies in silicon valley are driving innovation. The past 20 years of progress in computers, communication, and data have facilitated abundant scientific progress in a plethora of fields (if not *all* of them), it has had a profound global democratizing effect, and it is bringing the creative powers of people from some of the most remote parts of the world together and into the limelight. When a problem is solved with software, it isn't just solved for one person or a small group, it is solved for *everybody*. Meanwhile NASA has been putting antfarms into orbit to see what those little guys get up to.

Google is doing all kinds of cool stuff, and yes, it can be reduced to brand awareness raising, and their motivations can and should be questioned, they are a private corporation after all, but nonetheless they are a corporation that dedicates huge resources to tomorrow, and they are getting shit done. 

To argue that the benefits of companies like this have no humanitarian effect and limited strictly to shareholder value is myopic. The Bill and Melinda Gates foundation is another case in point, their efforts vastly more 'mission critical' than the lives of a few astronauts.

Self-Driving cars will be on public roads in less than a decade, the foundations for this have been laid and things are moving *fast*.

Sure. I can see that.  Although it may come gradually enough that new industries and new jobs will be available.

&gt;As for your point about the number of cars increasing, that might bbe the opposite of the case. The need for families to have more than one car will reduce significantly. When a bigger or second car is needed, it can be rented easily. People living in cities may barely need to buy a car ever. 

I'm actually thinking the opposite.  Two people, if they work 20 miles apart and need to get to the office at the same time, will still need 2 cars.

Plus, with self-driving cars, I can see either individuals or stores having tiny delivery vehicles.  The local pizza place could send out the pizza directly to your house when it's ready, rather than sending a delivery guy with a stack of deliveries.

Need some parts from Ace?  Order it online and they will send it immediately from the store, and not via mail.

All these delivery vehicles will still need repairs, at least until robots can repair everything or until it's cheaper to just replace it.

41,ahfoo,"Last night I put Arduino bootloaders on a fresh batch of ATMega328s which is sort of analogous to a little BIOS that allows these six dollar chips to use the Arduino Sketch software. That software comes with some cool little function libraries that make programming the chips very convenient. This week I'm reprogramming a dead washing machine with one of them and another is going into a servo mounted one watt blue LED that will be added to my collection of crazy lighting I have in the living room. 

It would be just as easy to mount a guided weapon onto one of them. This is the reality we're in. Just like hundred dollar two terabyte hard drives don't fit in with the copyright laws, technology is not something that a bunch of lawyers agree to in a wood paneled room under guidance from their corporate parent in New York. 

I disagree with American-style libertarians who say let the markets decide everything. I think that's a sad way of seeing the world in which we'd all be better off by sharing much more than we do. But I do agree that the state should stay out of people's private lives. 

Automated weapons systems may eventually prove be the way to achieve that goal that the politicians seem to have such a hard time with. If you've got a lethal force private security system then you might have to reconsider the idea of police making house calls anymore. How many no-knock raids will be mowed down by automated systems before such policies will start to be considered impractical. You can already see prototypes on YouTube. That's some scary stuff and it's already neither that expensive nor particularly difficult and you know it's just going to get easier and cheaper. It also creates a legal ambiguity because you can't attribute motive to machines and someone who programs a machine is only indirectly responsible for what the machine subsequently does. 

And of course we're merely at the earliest stages. How about self-driving cars? It's potentially a suicide car bomber without the suicide. That takes a lot of the trouble out of the idea. And once you reduce the costs and complexity then why just have one? How about a whole fleet of them working in concert? That's pretty hardcore. Potentially it could wipe out entire towns or take down large buildings. 

Seems to me that turning back the tide of lethal automation was never feasible to begin with. Instead perhaps we should start to ask why people are so filled with hatred that they would commit atrocious crimes like car bombings anyway. Perhaps policies like waging wars in far-away countries, supporting dictators, telling people what they can eat drink and smoke or even the politics of screwing over the poor should be reconsidered as better ways of preventing people from abusing technology for violent ends. 

Maybe we should look at this as a lesson in why teaching people how to love peace and giving everyone a chance to buy into a shared commonwealth is more critical than ever. 

But I don't doubt there will be some hairy shit involving non-biological assailants will have to happen first. Funny how the one thing could lead to the other. People might learn to get along once the machines start kicking some ass.

Which is funny, equating 1960's Soviet engineering to anything we can make today. But people are terrified that a nuclear bomb is being built in their backyard that could explode at any minute. And then any other incidents, no matter how small, send them into a panic. Remember Google's ""New privacy policy"" that didn't actually track anything new? People legitimately thought that Google was now going to be following them around all day, taking notes on their behavior just because nobody who was panicked actually read the dang thing.

A self-driving car will inevitably end up involved in some kind of accident, be it a collision or something else. And the conditions won't matter. If small children, especially infants, aren't picked up by the radar in time to stop the car then they may get run over. A smart parent *wouldn't let their toddler into the street*. And a human probably wouldn't notice either. And the fact that the computer can process that and instantly start to slam on the breaks, even if it doesn't solve the problem, less speed is better in that situation.

And finally [Taco Copter](http://tacocopter.com/) is a Silicon Valley start up that seeks to deliver tacos with unmanned aerial drones, only the United States government stops them from opening up their business. 

After AI and Robotics are fully matured, it is completely reasonable to think, in my opinion, that most human jobs would largely be replaced - allowing us to work shorter work weeks in more specialized creative forms of work.

130,nosoupforyou,"&gt;There's two things, the pool of drivers becomes more limited, which means that accident risk is more concentrated. 

But the pool of insurance customers aren't more limited.  You've still got the same total number of vehicles being insured, don't you?  Or are you eliminating the need for insurance for cars that aren't driven manually?

&gt;Plus, given that these cars will require a higher capital cost, the remaining car stock will be distributed among the poorer, generally more marginal, drivers.

Maybe, but I'm thinking that someone will come up with a way to add on the features of self-driving cars to them, much like you can get an aftermarket alarm, or remote-start added.  On the other hand, it would still cost a lot.

However, I see lots of poor people driving expensive vehicles, especially marginal drivers.  Some people just put all their money into vehicles instead, while many middle class people just want cars that get from one place to another.

Plus, driverless vehicles will eventually make it to the pool of used vehicles, so anyone will be able to afford them eventually.

Also, not sure how much the tech will really cost.  We're talking cameras, a computer system, a navigation system (which comes with even phones now), and a hook into the steering, brakes, and accelerator.  I'm not sure how much that will really end up costing.  

I'm sure the initial ones will be expensive, but over time I can see it coming with every car, and dropping to merely $2k per vehicle or less.

Even that much because a navigation system costs $1k with the car, even though you can get a TomTom for $100.  When navigation systems come standard, I expect the cost will be $100 added to the vehicle.

&gt;That will serve to make any driver that doesn't have an automatic driver a higher risk. Plus, having other drivers be safer will really only serve to lower costs in no-fault states. Automatic cars can't really help you against stupid and unsafe drivers.

It can, to some extent.  An automatic system can detect a vehicle moving toward you.  Some accidents are avoidable if even one of the drivers knows what to do.  It's not like the pool of manual drivers will all be driving in one area while automatic cars drive elsewhere.

135,menotbug,"I do see it happening outside big cities. A taxi service of self-driving cars would be way more convenient than driving your own car no matter where you are (okay maybe not the outskirts of alaska), and the companies would be super-cheap to start up, and pay themselves off extremely quick.

Benefits:

 - No more drunk driving or paying for actual taxis
 - Cheaper than owning a car since the company could probably handle 10 people who use it exclusively per car, and the company's expenses wouldn't be any more than a normal person owning a single car plus the extra gas (or electric as I would assume they would use electric vehicles for short commutes).
 - You would never need to maintain it. (the comany would, but once again, it is maintaining one car per 10 people)
 - It could drive your children around (no more picking them up from school and no needing to buy your 16 year-old a car that they are just going to crash).
 - Always have the vehicle you need. (small fuel-efficient one-person 'car' for commuting, big truck for getting your boat to the lake, gas-based car for long commutes)
 - Parking / Garages become unnecessary (cars will find their own parking, and be fixed by the company), which would immediately make it cheaper than owning a car in a city with the $100+/mo parking.
 - Company pays the insurance (which i would assume would be less than 10 people's insurances combined)
 - If you assume ~10 people per car, it might need to be replaced twice as fast, which means you are almost always using newer tech than normal drivers.
 - As any car-lot would put it ""no down-payment, lower monthly-payments!""

Cons:

 - You don't own it. (some people will see this as a detriment.. I don't really)
 - If you live far away from an available car it may take a little time to be picked up. (as it become popular this would be less of a problem as they would probably have an available car every couple blocks just waiting)

And really to start up the company all you would need is some software to manage your fleet, borrow enough money to buy like 10 cars for a small town, and a mechanic to keep your fleet running. (If you are already a mechanic.. really you could just start up the business by leasing the cars) Then a large mega-corp will either franchise them all, and have a car-sharing policy, or just outright buy the whole system and literally own nearly all the cars and mechanics in the whole country.

147,nosoupforyou,"I think delivering pizza was just an example of how it will transform our society.

I've posted before about changes I expect to see once self-driving cars are commonplace and don't legally require a person in the driver's seat.

Street parking will vanish.  When you get to work, your car will drop you off and then go find a cheap or free parking spot to wait, unless it needs an oil change or to get gas.  When you're ready to be picked up, it will be waiting for you at the door.

Huge chunks of revenue for cities will evaporate because tickets, parking or speeding, will largely disappear.  But at the same time, expenses will drop as there will be less need for police to watch for speeders or for meter maids.

Automated taxis will be cheap and small, as they won't require an expensive human to operate them.  People in large cities may even quit owning cars, if using a car is infrequent enough that self-driving taxis make getting around cheaper. 

Public transportation will become easier to use.  Your car will drop you off at the train station and pick you up in the evening.  At your destination, getting to your office will just mean a cheap automated taxi.

Taking long distance trains will be more feasible, as you won't need to rent a car when you arrive.  The cheap taxis again.  Currently, I personally hate the idea of taking a train to visit family because I'd either have to hire an expensive taxi, rent an expensive car, or require them to come get me at the station.  But with cheap taxis and self-driving cars, it's not a problem.

Since there won't be a need for commuter parking lots anywhere, more homes or even small businesses targetting commuters may appear there.

With more and more people using robotic cars, insurance costs will drop.

Car theft and vandalism will become harder, as cars could easily record and transmit video of the thieves, if the car simply doesn't drive off to avoid them.  

The same videoing by cars could provide data to police for other crimes too.  Potentially someone robs a bank and runs.  The police could potentially have all cars in the area watching and notifying them where the robbers go.

Although part of the issue with truckers is that they do more than simply drive the truck.  They usually have to get signatures for the property transfer.

But quite likely, eventually truckers won't exist.  Shipments will be sent on their own to their destination possibly as soon as the order is made.

Instead of sending 10k units across the country to a distributor once a month, mfrs may send daily shipments instead.  Sending bigger and bigger loads won't necessarily be worth it if it's automated.  1 load of 100k units might not be more cost effective to send than 100 1k units if the loading, packaging, and transporting is all automated.

But that won't happen overnight.  Even once we have such delivery vehicles, a lot of mfrs won't switch over, simply because they like doing things the way they always have and they don't want to lay off employees.  I expect it will happen with attrition though.  As truckers retire or quit, more self-driving units will be brought in.

Not to mention the probable outcome of anyone trying to replace truckers at once.  Blockades, picketing, ""accidental"" damage to self-driving package units.  The truckers union will probably fight the hell out of this sort of thing.  But eventually robots will replace truckers.

But I expect robots will be doing more unappealing work before we start eliminating truck driving as a career.  Even automation is coming for chicken deboning.

As long as there is competition their rates will lower if your risk lowers. So if they know you work out often and eat right, you are a safe bet and they will offer you a lower rate than someone they know *nothing* about. At the same token if they know you eat McDonalds every day, smoke, and never work out, you are a terrible bet and either won't get insurance or get an extremely high rate. I honestly don't see a problem with this.

It takes away a lot of the gamble and allows insurance companies to care more about root causes. For instance right now my insurance company co-pays for a fitness membership for me most likely because they save money in the long run if it encourages me to work out. This helps both of us and encourages a positive feedback loop.

Edit: Lets put it this way. If I am running a car insurance company and statistics show that self-driving cars are in nearly 0 accidents, knowing this information allows me to offer a significantly lower (almost $0) rate to self-driving cars. If I didn't, someone else would.

199,HoesFOSHO,"Not necessarily. Many economists today point to companies' ability to get more out of each worker because of advances in technology. They suggest that this is a partial cause for unemployment in first world economies. If cars never crash again, think of the many small-business mechanic shops that would go under, the police officers that would not have to monitor traffic, the truck drivers union that would not need to operate the trucks, the list goes on.

There's absolutely no doubt that self driving cars would have a net benefit on the economy as a whole, you are right about that. But I believe he was talking about the jobs that would be lost, and I think he has an interesting and valid point.",1341190493,c588285,t1_c587s32,technology,t5_2qh16,2011
200,HoesFOSHO,"Thank you for such a thorough reply. First, let me say that I completely agree with what you are saying and by no means are you wrong. there are just a few other pieces to this vastly intricate and beautifully complex puzzle that we call ""the modern economy"" that I would like to point out:

Notice how the jobs that I listed are occupied by unskilled and semiskilled workers. I believe that in the modern economy, the need for these types of individuals may be relatively stagnant, but as technology improves, the *wages* of unskilled and semiskilled workers is in an exponentially downward trend. We both agree that an self-driving car would completely eliminate the need for truck drivers. You are arguing that those jobs will be made up elsewhere in the economy, a valid point which I completely agree with. BUT will the new position pay that jobless truck driver as much as his previous unionized job did? Probably not. I mean, the skill set he possesses is now completely obsolete! I believe this example is applicable to basically all unskilled and semiskilled jobs across the economy. If you look at the unemployment numbers [which have held steady for *years* now, suggesting this is not an anomaly], the vast majority of unemployed are non college educated, unskilled or semiskilled workers.

Finally, let me conclude with a different example of technological advancement, one likely to blow up in 20-30 years. Robot humanoid workers. Let's imagine Apple invents the iRobot, capable of waiting tables, making lattes, farm work, basically any unskilled or semiskilled job. Since these robot are expensive, Apple rents them to employers on an hourly basis. At a certain point the technology will make this robot cheaper to rent than a minimum wage human with equal productivity. Do you think your hypothesis will still apply? Just some food for thought.

A car being controlled by a hostile SDU (Self-Driving Unit, I guess) could block the line of sight to an upcoming obstruction, and tell the car behind it that the coast is clear, then produce a sudden lane-change without alerting the car, giving the car behind it no time to react to suddenly seeing a random obstruction.

&gt;""idiot without autodrive is tailgating you""  

 I believe that once we have self driving technology on the market, human driving will become illegal very quickly. I imagine it won't be rolled out right away and there will be some sort of 'adjustment period' where certain cars are not allowed and other cars are retrofitted to with the technology. (This is just my thoughts, but) imagine the first couple years in such a system. All cars still have manual control, *but* only cars with computer control and are allowed on highways. If you still have a legacy car, drive on backroads. At the entrance ramp, the computer takes control of the car. Implementing automated driving on highways shouldn't be too difficult, and the benefit would be less traffic and much higher speeds. 

&gt;"" incredibly advanced driving AI and networked together so that they can all share information and deal with road and traffic conditions""

I use this GPS application called ""Waze"" on my iPhone. It shares traffic conditions and allows people to report accidents and other things down the road. It sucks in a suburban area, where &lt;1% of people have it turned on, but driving in a metropolitan area like NYC with many users makes this information extremely useful. Having something like that automated, mandated and implemented into every single car would be revolutionary.

This is a loaded question.  With no other infrastructure in place, similar traffic density, and destinations that varied in shape, size, and location, the plane could be more difficult.

The problem-space is different in real life, though.  Planes land at fixed-location airports with navigation beacons and slope indicators.  The airports don't move.  The runways are cleared between landings.

If everywhere you needed to go was an empty parking space with a radio beacon and the route was almost completely free of traffic, and open in all three dimensions... we'd already have self-driving cars in exactly the same way we've already got autopilot, auto-takeoff, and auto-landing in aircraft.  

The unexpected event scenarios are easier for an aircraft, too.  Far fewer objects to interact with, and ""engine out"" or ""wing fell off"" or ""fuel leaking at rate X from tank Y"" are all problems that are either simply solvable or unrecoverable.

Here are just a 'few' reasons why.

- Lower insurance costs

- Radio will die. People will watch/read news on their commute

- No more worrying about Drinking/Driving. Pubs will be more popular.

- Teenagers/kids can go where ever they want. No need for parents to drive them. Centers devoted to kids hanging out that is not school will start up

- Shipping costs will drop drastically. Shipping will be faster. More online buying. Big box stores will decline.

- National Stress levels will drop, national health levels will go up, due to lower stress, chances to eat a good breakfast on the way to work, etc

- Major unemployment, as Snow removal, Taxi, Garbage, Bus, Truck, Delivery drivers are now no longer needed,

- Lighting of highways/roads unnecessary

- Traffic lights, Signs, road markings, all unnecessary

- Headlights. Unnecessary

- Exodus of people moving outside of the cities. Commuting is easier, more relaxing and faster.

- National fuel consumption takes a NOSE DIVE. due to the drastic lowered requirement of random braking/acceleration because of fluid traffic flow

- Emergencies will be faster responded too. Fire Trucks, Ambulances.

- Police force can be cut down drastically. No more traffic cops.

- Parking? Who cares. Car drops you off at the front door and drives to where ever it needs to, to park.

Basically. The first country to allow robotic vehicles to take off, will DESTROY everyone else in the world on an economic level. The cost reductions are massive. The benefits are massive.

The technology for computer driven cars will be available by the end of the decade. If you drive down the 101 in Silicon Valley you can often see Google's fleet, which is currently completely self-driven.

http://www.forbes.com/sites/robenderle/2012/06/01/the-coming-world-of-self-driving-cars-why-2080-may-look-a-lot-like-1880/

Consider these facts about self-driving cars:

1) Once widespread adopted they'll drastically increase highway carrying capacity, and should cut congestion down to next to nothing.

2) Accident rates will fall dramatically because of computer's superior reaction times. Currently trains are the safer form of transportation, but self-driven cars are safer than trains.

3) With widespread adoption speed limits will be able to be raised significantly. Modern cars can easily travel 150+ MPH, but we don't set speed limits that high because humans can't safely drive at those speeds.

4) Fuel efficiency will increase significantly because computers are smoother drivers and there will be less congestion. In addition the cost of traveling by car will fall since you won't need to own one, but can call it up out of a publicly available fleet to pick you up.

All this is telling me that within 10 years or so it should be possible to drive from LA to SF at 150+ MPH with no traffic. The fuel cost should be small, and you won't even need to own a car. You go directly from point to point without having to go to a train station and wait on a schedule.

The technology will be fairly cheap once it's mass-produced.  There may be older country roads requiring manual assistance, but for most maintained highways it will be fine.

Why would you need to get freight off the roads?  Freight can coexist just fine.  The wear on roads may actually be better as you won't have human drivers exceeding the speed-limit to make a journey while they're awake.  The freight will lumber along in the slow-lane, and passenger cars can negotiate passage between them.  Regardless, freight doesn't destroy roads.  Also, you don't need high-speed rail for freight.

263,jasnooo,"I urge you to go read-up on the current state of self-driving vehicles and imagine their promise.  We are very close to vehicles that don't need humans.  Imagine a future where most people don't own vehicles.  When you need one, you lease an appropriate vehicle for your travel needs.  Within minutes, a car/suv/truck shows up at your door.  The car does the driving and you arrive safely at your destination.  Staying a few days?  Simply release the vehicle, where it is free to be assigned to other passengers and delivers itself accordingly.  

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car:

Autonomous cars are not in widespread use, but their introduction could produce several direct advantages:

* Fewer crashes, due to the autonomous system's increased reliability compared to human drivers[7]
* Increased roadway capacity and reduced traffic congestion due to reduced need of safety gaps[8] and the ability to better manage traffic flow.[7]
* Relief of vehicle occupants from driving and navigation chores.[7]
* Removal of constraints on occupant's state - it would not matter if the occupants were too young, too old or if their frame of mind were not suitable to drive a traditional car. Furthermore, disabilities would no longer matter.[9]
* Alleviation of parking scarcity as cars could drop off passengers, park far away where space is not scarce, and return as needed to pick up passengers.
* Elimination of redundant passengers - humans are not required to take the car anywhere, as the robotic car can drive empty to wherever it is required.[9]
* Greater suitability for car-sharing services.[10][11]
* Reduction of space required for vehicle parking.[12]
* Reduction in the need for traffic police and vehicle insurance.
* Reduction of physical road signage - autonomous cars could receive necessary communication electronically rather than relying on physical road signs and markings. (Although the physical signs would still be required for any human drivers.)[13][14][15]

Freight doesn't destroy roads.  It obviously uses some of the road's capacity, but it doesn't destroy it.  Self-driving cars will dramatically increase capacity of existing roads.  Cars that are running on autopilot can travel inches away from each other and negotiate with cars in other lanes to allow safe, efficient merging.  Freight will transition to automated control alongside passenger vehicles.  Self-driving motorcycles will allow single passenger travel to reach a new level of safety and efficiency.  Road speeds will be able to increase, reducing travel times and negating the benefit from high speed rail.

Again you complain about road quality and I just don't see how it is relevant.  Self-driving cars are more than able to detect potholes and obstacles and can route-around them or halt the vehicle safely.

The scope of what I'm mentioning is quite large.  I'm talking about a future where you might not be able to drive a human piloted vehicle on public roads.  I'm not saying I agree with it, but it is a future that is coming, and sooner than we(i.e. - society) think.  Do you think that laying high-speed rail track in the most expensive state in the nation will be a small undertaking?  Remember that the billions we're talking about here involve laying some of the cheapest track in the proposed rail system.  What happens when you try to lay track in rich coastal communities or in environmentally sensitive areas?  

Just look at the rosy predictions used to justify high-speed rail in California.  It won't be profitable any time soon.  There just aren't that many people driving across California.  I've been all over this state and the transportation problems that need the most attention all involve interurban transit.  Expanding bus lines would do far more to enhance the lives of the average commuter in CA.  I know, buses aren't sexy, but they work and they're vastly cheaper than rail.

Look, rail is a poor fit for the US.  It worked out fine in many areas of the world due to geographical, economic, and social factors, but it isn't well suited to the US.  

We've spent trillions of dollars on road infrastructure in this country and a technology is coming that will bring that infrastructure into the 21st century.  We should be funneling our resources into making that leap.

&gt;a self-driving car will have to be able to assess braking ability the same as we humans do. 


A car slows because some metal plates are pushed against other metal plates. If you make those plates bigger and push with more force, it will come to stand faster. 

The maximum power a car can break with does not depend on  the driver, because with your foot, you only trigger the break. The application of power is done by the machine. 

Different cars have different breaks with different ability to reduce velocity. That means one of them comes to stand faster than the other if both breake full power. If this is the car in the fron, the trailing car will hit it if they start with 5 cm distance.

Where I live 10-20 miles over is the norm, traveling the speed limit is widely considered dangerous and the police only pull you over if you are driving over 90mph or otherwise being an idiot (and have been known to pull people over traveling the speed limit for impeding traffic), and they get their quota off that alone. Because it is so poorly enforced, everybody drives fast and because everybody drives fast, attempting to drive the speed limit gets you lines of tailgating cars and road-rage from the impatient citizens. So in the intermediate case, when there are less then half the cars on the road being self-driving, this could be a big difficulty and safety issue.

It would be easy to just blame all the ""crazy"" fast drivers, or the police for lack of enforcement (as far as I can tell they LIKE being able to pull over just about anybody they want for speeding), but in the end it would be a new factor that adds more danger to an established system, and we would need a way to handle the transition to the safer far side where most cars are self driving.",1342286505,c5dzdgh,t3_wjfq5,technology,t5_2qh16,2011

People think that they're going to be sitting there pounding on the dash because other cars are passing them...no, you're not.  If you have a self-driving car you're going to sit back and enjoy the ride, complaining as much about the pace as you would on a subway.

I've driven everything from a motorcycle to a huge big rig moving boats around for the Navy.  In my experience, I can attest to the fact that driving slower is always safer.  The only unsafe situation that ever came from someone driving the speed limit came from all the douche bags around them.  I'm not saying that I'm against speeding.

Google has, for a long time, had far more money than it knows what to do with. Something like 90 plus % of Google's revenue (and they have a lot of it) comes from its ad services, particularly ads that they have on their own sites, the search engine, Gmail, etc. Google basically cracked search, quite a while ago now, and are dominant there, by a substantial margin. They make more than 9 billion dollars a year in **profit**, but there is only so much development they can possibly do on their core services. How much tinkering with the search algorithm do you think they do? They're sitting on serious cash which they don't want to give away as a dividend because there is the feeling that as a tech company, they should be investing their profits into development rather than giving it to shareholders. But developing what?

Google's answer so far has been projects that don't even pretend to have short term returns. Like the augmented reality glasses, or the self driving car. Seriously, how much money have they spent on the self driving car? Quite a lot (although, still, not the same order of magnitude as the money they take in elsewhere) How much revenue have they made with it? None. And probably won't in the near future. They are developing technologies with a very long term focus. The same is true of Google fiber. Without a doubt, the barrier costs of laying fiber are the most significant in this industry and the lack of competition means that existing service providers don't feel the need to make that investment themselves. Enter Google. One of only handful of companies that could possibly justify such a spectacular start up cost for  a project that probably won't turn a profit for a decade.

Some of the traditional problems that people have a self driving car will excel at.

* Robot car does not drink, lose focus, or get tired
* Robot car has superhuman reflexes and is a lot more aware of the vehicles capabilities
* In a rain storm where a human would have reduced visibility robot car can still ""see"" up to a level depending on the sensors.

Some things the car will have to deal with:

* If the robot car has no info for your road you will have to drive it at least the first time to train the car.
* If a road has recently changed the robot car will probably have to hand control back to the user. This can be avoided using a central database that tracks road conditions such as maintenance.
* Security &amp; updates If there is a flaw in the system it will need an update. If the is a venerability in the system it can be exploited.
* When the robot car does crash, who is to blame?

Things that are major problem without good solutions:

* When the road is covered in snow the robot car is unable to determine where the road is. GPS just doesn't cut it. You need to be within a couple of inches.",1344556995,c5qsekp,t3_xy6tb,technology,t5_2qh16,2011

If a self-driving car actually *is* safer than a human driver, then it would be very easy to install a similar interlock system which prevents the car from moving if the 'driver' is impaired.  Yes, there are ways around the interlock, but if you as the 'driver' circumvent the safety features, then you are the responsible party:  You can't sue an auto manufacturer for a faulty seatbelt if you don't wear it, or faulty brakes if you didn't use them to prevent the accident.  (and yes, investigators CAN TELL if your seatbelt wasn't in use, or if/when you applied the brakes)

Systems are already available that can detect when a driver is falling asleep and sound an alarm to wake them.  It wouldn't be *that* much of a stretch to have a self-driving car pull off the road and turn itself off if the driver falls asleep.

I think this actually is a major problem. Speed limits are intentionally set low, because everyone uses them as an ""about this fast"" number, but also defers to their own judgment on the proper speed for this road at this time.

So, for example, there's a road in the middle of nowhere in Colorado that I have taken more times than I can count. Usually no one's on it. If I obey the speed limit, it's about 2 hours to the destination. If I go what feels like the right speed, given the lack of traffic and the amazing visibility, it's 90 minutes. Now, that's not flying, either; that's at about 85mph on the straightaways, even though the speed limit is only 65. Basically interstate speeds (no one drives 75) gets me there much faster. If I had to sit and wait for the toaster to drive me there every time (and still have to sit in the driver's seat, paying attention, so I couldn't have a beer and watch TV or read a book or whatever), then no, that's not worth it to me in any imaginable way.

If you can automate all self-driving cars then traffic won't be a problem. Nor will you need to stop at intersections often.

And once that happens you can set the speed limit at whatever's reasonable so long as the car can maintain control in case of an emergency. I'd say this depends on how safe you can quickly stop or redirect the car if someone unexpected happens.

In other words, the speed limit won't be an issue anymore because it'll be a relic of another era. Of course, the kind of people who want to be able to push the speed limit or nudge themselves over it are probably also the kind of people who feel like weaving and aggressive driving get them where they're going faster even though 90% of the time they end up stopped at the same lights/traffic as the people they just spend a lot of time passing.

Self-driving cars would literally need to *actively try to throw people off cliffs* in order to be worthless.

After that the technology would be pushed by insurance companies because they could offer these slightly cheaper plans and have much greater assurance that they'd be paying out insurance claims less often because they could simply choose to cover less damage if manual driving was enabled during the accident, or no payout at all for people on the super cheap plans except in situations when they're completely not at fault in which case it would be the full amount, but they would probably leverage the use of manual driving to lower their payout to people.",1344577755,c5qxflt,t1_c5qtkna,technology,t5_2qh16,2011

In the future, we may ride in self-driving electric vehicles, all our devices may talk to each other, and we may interact with augmented as well as regular reality.

Cars with smart ignition keys are proliferating daily. *But wait! What if the ignition mechanism failed when someone is trying to escape an attacker?!* Well, funny thing. They don't often fail. Not everything is designed as poorly as your wireless router.

*What if someone hacked the wireless ignition to steal a car?!* You're right! It's been proven that keyless entry systems can be hacked. Curiously, the people who have broken the security measures need to have physical access to the car. Same as any other carjacker would. So, at that point, a smart technology is no worse than a simple key. Rudimentary or high-tech, systems can be broken.

And as for software being 100% reliable...not every piece of software is Windows. You are surrounded, every day, by reliable software. Software that runs your car, runs traffic signals, runs your ATM, manages your bank account... specialized systems *all over the place* that are designed to perform very specific tasks that require a high degree of stability. Claiming ""Oh, software might be unreliable"" is a lame excuse. Software is only as unreliable as the person writing it. The consumer companies you deal with on a daily basis allow a level of instability because they can get away with it, but when companies can't because it's too high risk, shit doesn't ship until it's ready.

30,LL_Cool_Bean,"Reasons I am looking forward to fully-automatic, accurate and safe self-driving vehicles:

* At my discretion, I can choose not to own a car any more. If I choose, I can pay per use or enter into a monthly/annual rental agreement and summon a car to come get me when I need one. I can pre-schedule pickup and drop-off when I know my travel requirements in advance.
* If I choose to own a car, it can go get itself an oil change and other maintenance while I'm at work. I will never need to take my car in for service again. I can tell my car to go get itself washed on a prearranged schedule, and never visit the car wash myself ever again.
* Related to the above: I will never stop to buy gasoline (or stop for electricity) again. My car will automatically seek out the most cost-efficient location to buy gasoline, and will fill itself at night.
* No more searching for a parking space. My car will drop me off right at the front door of the airport / my home / my office / the theater / etc and go find a space to park itself. It will return to pick me up when I'm ready to leave (as indicated by a summons from my smart phone.)
* Some errands will happen without me. For example, I can order my groceries from the local grocery store (which will slowly morph into a grocery warehouse), and send my car to go pick them up (or the grocery store can send an automated truck to deliver them to me.)
* No more drunk driving accidents and deaths
* No more on-road accidents caused by distracted driving, aggressive driving, etc.
* Fewer vehicles on the road, as carpooling becomes much more efficient and practical. I can just set up an online account with one of several private commercial carpool companies, and schedule my travel times and destinations (work / home / etc.) Algorithms will dynamically optimize pickup routes and will send an automated car / van to pick up me (and the other members of my ""pool"") as part of an ad hoc ""route"" that may change from day to day - but will guarantee my pick up and drop off times within +- 5 minutes. And on the off chance that I get stranded or change my plans for some reason, I can always summon my personal vehicle to come get me, or call one of the automated taxi services.
* I'm sure there are many more positive changes I'm not thinking about. I just hope this all comes to fruition before I die (I'm 48 years old now.)",1357668998,c7tbfhd,t3_164uql,technology,t5_2qh16,2013

They were the only ones smart enough to get Sebastian Thrun and the Stanford team on board after the Darpa challenge. They're the one's that have legislators and policy makes rolling out the red carpet. They even went so far as to hire the deputy director of the NHSTA to oversee the safety of their vehicles. Whatever the other auto companies have been doing has been insubstantial relative to Google's efforts. Google is a new breed. Car companies are dinosaurs: for them it's a race to the bottom.

The popular perception is that the hardware and software needed to make these cars work would be cost prohibitive, but now estimates are down to a couple thousand, which is very affordable, and we're only talking about the first run.

The typical knee-jerk reaction I see from people when first introduced to the idea is that there will a lot of public and legal resistance to the idea. Once a person thinks it through, though, it quickly becomes a no brainer. Legislators in Washington and California are surprisingly optimistic and are practically rolling out the red carpet. The fact that Google is killing it at the technology end of things is certainly helping the case. In testing they're getting close to 600,000 miles with no accidents. They say they need  725,000 miles accident free to demonstrate with 99% certainty that a self driving car is statistically safer than a human driver. 

Driving as it currently stands has made our cities dangerous, dirty, sprawling but still congested, noisy, and expensive.

A single occupant commuter need not be anything more than a glorified electric wheelchair. Getting to work in a robotaxi will cost less than riding the bus, and will be 10 times as fast. How soon will this happen? With that kind of logic driving the arguments, there is no reason no to do it ASAP.

The self driving car could be fast-tracked. It could spark an arms-race. It could be the next great American infrastructure project. It could be nuts.

This seems like a highly unlikely price range for the full platform. GPS has been in cars for several years and if I want to add a navigation to a 4runner it is part of a $5,000 package. Manufacturers charge hundreds of dollars just for extremely rudimentary backup cameras. 

$2,000 isn't close to even being in the ballpark. I searched and found [this](http://www.businessinsider.com/google-self-driving-car-sensor-cost-2012-9): 

&gt;the massive array of sensors Google has to install in its cars alone costs $250,000 or more

This is /just/ the sensors. This doesn't even start on the technology that it takes to collect the massive amounts of data, analyze it, make decisions with it, and drive the car. Currently an engineer still rides in the car in case they have to assist it as well. Since these are google employees on the team making the software they are unlikely to disclose real data about just how often that happens.

Even if the sensors could be made cheaper who is to say the cheaper version will be of the same quality? How do they perform if people don't keep them clean? 

Without an engineer on standby, if people are planning to sleep in their cars, is just one array of sensors sufficient or is an entire redundant backup system required for production vehicles? What is the impact of something like GPS tampering once cars are dependent on it? 

Mass production will bring some costs down but the platform would have significantly steeper R&amp;D costs (compared to current vehicles) and likely require pretty rigorous (read: expensive) certification testing before Joe Blow can buy one to sleep in the back seat on the commute to work every day.

$2,000 is less than 1% of the actual cost and there are still many other factors.

Lets look at one small aspect: parking. there are as many as 2 billion parking spaces in America. The average parking space costs about $5,000 to build. Some cities have as much as 1/3 of their useable land mass dedicated to parking. In Houston there are 30 parking spaces for every resident. Parking lots are the single most salient feature in the built-up landscape. In busy, metropolitan areas where parking is at a premium drivers are estimated to spend as much as 60% of their driving time just looking around for a decent spot to park. Math it out in your head: That's a lot of time, money and real estate that can be repurposed for better things.

A single occupant commuter need not be anything more than a glorified electric wheelchair. Getting to work in a robotaxi will cost as much as the bus, and will be 10 times as fast.

No one said all of a sudden, and I didn't say they won't be on the road.  Congestion is very largely human-caused, and will be ameliorated very much as there are fewer human errors (and self-driving cars next to them that can mitigate those errors.)

&gt;Then...if these people don't have cars, and need to call in for a car to come pick them up

Why would the car be far away?  You really haven't thought this through... The cab service just chooses the nearest car.  Algorithms will make this rather speedy.  Further, how often do you need a car immediately?  You'll be able to app a cab in a few minutes, or make an appointment (like a cab now, but likely better.)  Already, in even medium-sized cities, there's probably a Zip Car five minutes away from everywhere in town.

Hackers?  Yeah, perhaps.  Just like a single terrorist could wreak havoc on our electrical grid.  It might be tougher than you think, and there's not a whole lot of incentive for a hacker to actually do this.  I don't think the risk outweighs the benefits, but this is far beyond either of our pay grades, I suspect.

You don't.

Like everything else, there's no reason not to have both, as I'm sure the market can support both for those who wish to do either.

Sum total of miles driven so far by the *entire* Google ""fleet"" of driverless vehicles?  [Around 300,000 miles](http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/11/12/self-driving-cars/) -- or in other words we should so far have expected 0.0033 deaths... which averages to zero.

Let me know when they have about a BILLION total miles on their fleet -- *AND when most of said mileage has been racked up with the vehicles in the hands of ""everyday joes"" for everyday use on all kids of roads and conditions and with ""joe"" handling the casual maintenance* -- THEN, if they are STILL at zero accidents and zero total deaths, it'll be worth looking at.

Until then, they do not have a statistical case to crow about.

Your point is daft for three reasons.

1. You're still blaming Google's car for something which is not its fault.

2. Humans are predominantly looking forwards, only occasionally glancing into the rear vision mirror. A Google car would have sensors on all sides working all the time. The probability of a human spotting a car about to rear end them, let alone reacting in time, is slight. The probability of the Google car spotting it is 100%. After all, it is an absolute requirement that Google's cars be able to recognise other cars on the road and calculate their speed, direction and acceleration. They simply wouldn't function at all unless they could do that.

3. The Google car was *[at a red light](http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/news/industry/4-questions-about-googles-self-driving-car-crash)*.

Sooner or later they will built special 'cars' designed solely to run small errands using drive in places. These cars will no longer be designed with passengers and passenger safety in mind and will likely become a lot smaller.

135,fricken,"7 years ago fully autonomous cars were sci-fi. The popular perception only 6 months ago was that Self driving cars would be on the market in a decade. In September Sergei Brin said you can count on 1 hand the number of years it will be before you can ride in one, and even that may be a conservative estimate. The popular perception is that the hardware and software needed to make these cars work would be cost prohibitive, but now estimates are down to a couple thousand, which is very affordable, and we're only talking about the first run.

The typical knee-jerk reaction I see from people when first introduced to the idea is that there will a lot of public and legal resistance to it. Once a person thinks it through, though, it quickly becomes a no brainer. Legislators in Washington and California are surprisingly optimistic and are practically rolling out the red carpet. The fact that Google is killing it at the technology end of things is certainly helping the case. In testing they're getting close to 600,000 miles with no accidents. They say they need 725,000 miles accident free to demonstrate with 99% certainty that a self driving car is statistically safer than a human driver.

Driving as it currently stands has made our cities dangerous, dirty, sprawling but still congested, noisy, and expensive. Properly implemented electric robotaxis wired into a centralized traffic management system can end all that shit right quick. Most of us have resigned ourselves to the necessity of the driving lifestyle but many harbour a latent spite for everything about it, we've just never had the opportunity to consider an alternative. You're a second class citizen in most parts of North America if you don't have a car.

Forward thinking municipalities are already starting to recognize just how much their citizens stand to benefit from a mature no-holds barred all-in autonomous transit system in their city with as few human drivers on the road as possible, and they're vibrating with excitement. The aesthetic, safety, and economic benefits are profound.
Lets look at one small aspect: parking. there are as many as 2 billion parking spaces in America. The average parking space costs about $5,000 to build. Some cities have as much as 1/3 of their useable land mass dedicated to parking. In Houston there are 30 parking spaces for every resident. Parking lots are the single most salient feature in the built-up landscape. In busy, metropolitan areas where parking is at a premium drivers are estimated to spend as much as 60% of their driving time just looking around for a decent spot to park. Math it out in your head: That's a lot of time, money and real estate that can be repurposed for better things.

A single occupant commuter need not be anything more than a glorified electric wheelchair. Getting to work in a robotaxi will cost as much as the bus, and will be 10 times as fast. It'll cost as little as 2 bucks to get to work. The average car now costs users 21$ a day. How soon will this happen? With the kind of logic driving the arguments, there is no reason no to do it ASAP.

The self driving car could be fast-tracked. It could spark an arms-race. It could be the next great American infrastructure project. It could be nuts. We don't need these things tomorrow, we need them yesterday. There are any number of business owners who will look at the numbers and realize 'hey, wait a minute- my operating costs could be reduced by 10, 20, or 30 percent', and in some cases more. I think it will prompt all sorts of pressure on the government to get things moving. Whatever the upfront costs of aggressive implementation are, it'll pay for itself 100 times over down the road.

This is all based on the assumption that they work and work well. Google's team has yet to do much testing in bad (winter) driving conditions, so that could be a setback, but at this point I doubt it. It's not a hard sell, unless you drive for a living. Or manufacture the unweildy beasts we drive today. Or if you sell collision insurance. Or maybe if you're a personal injury lawyer.",1359310205,c84ifif,t3_17dhmp,technology,t5_2qh16,2013

I just think that when people discuss how ""innovative"" Apple is they should take a deeper look at it and see that a vast majority of their innovations have been business/marketing related, not technological. They are treated as if they are the inventors of the last decade + of technology, when in reality all they did was take existing products and revamp them then attach them to an absolutely brilliant marketing campaign/sales strategy (iTunes). 

2) You made it sound as if the iOS mobile interface was revolutionary in some way, when in reality the interface was just an alternative version of something that already existed. Again, the primary innovations with the iPhone come down to marketing and business/sales. As a matter of fact the first iPhone, if you remove the app store, was so lacking in features it was ridiculous. If any other company had released the exact same phone with the same features and without the app store it would've been laughed off the market. The technological advantage was really only the capacitive screen vs the resistive norm. 

If my response was due to a misunderstanding on my part then I apologize. 

3) I'd say the Macbook Air is no more or less innovative than any of their other products. 

4) I honestly don't know how to respond to this. Google devotes a majority of their resources to r&amp;d, and it shows. *They've successfully designed a self driving car*. They completely changed the landscape of the internet in several different ways.

Then there's [all the other things they offer online for free](http://www.google.com/about/products/). Many people consider Google to be the most innovative company in the world, and when you put all things on the table it's pretty hard to come up with another company that comes close to what they offer.

My original post was simply pointing out that those who say Apple is no longer innovative are not looking at the history over the past decade. There are very clear points were Apple released ""innovative"" products that drastically changed the landscape of music,computing,telecommunications etc. I don't think it's particularly useful to argue the semantics of whether this is innovation/marketing/sales/business etc. 

You claim that google has done all of these innovative things, but these are all research products. You can't get a google car, you can't get google glasses, you can't get google fiber? How is google fiber innovative? In that sense, a university is the most innovative company in the world. All they do is innovate. This is why I feel that claiming a company is innovative is an extremely hand wavy argument. You can't simply judge the innovation of a company based on their scientific/engineering feats. You have to look at it in the context of the company/world. Microsoft had their original surface table years before the iPhone, but it doesn't mean anything since they never shipped enough to make a difference. The mouse existed before the Mac, Mp3 players existed before the iPod. It doesn't mean that the Mac, iPod, and iPhone weren't innovative, and it doesn't mean that the original inventors weren't innovating. 

Along the same vein, you claim google fiber is innovative. Why? The technology is exactly the same as any other FiOS service. The only thing innovative about it is that google is selling at cost (or close to it). Is the google fiber business model innovative? The fact that google subsidizes all of their services because they make money on ads is a business model that has existed for decades. The radio is free because the stations make money on ads. Network tv is free because the networks make money on ads. You can get those cheap magazine subscriptions because they make money on ads. So where is innovation in google fiber? Is the google car innovative? Self driving tech has existed for years. I had an EE professor who pioneered some of the self driving car research. Does that mean google isn't innovative? See, if you look hard enough, it's always easy to pass off a product as not being innovative. But the truth is more nuanced. Yes, google fiber is innovative, yes the google car is innovative.

The thing that's innovative to me is that they've really taken an approach to give consumers as much as possible *for free*, which is the polar opposite of what just about any other profitable company does. If you live in a city that Google Fiber is offered in you can just call them up and get signed up. Zero dollars monthly. I don't know of any other American companies offering this, very few that would even halfway consider it. The self-driving car is amazing because it's been a theory, never successfully executed. Especially not on this scale (at least not that I know of). They've been at the head of ""cloud computing"" with all of their cloud services/offerings. This isn't even going into all of their charitable ventures.

I'd say Google is innovative in the same ways that Apple is innovative; Software and offerings. Which is my main point - I fail to see how Apple is innovative as far as hardware is really concerned. I think that they get far too much credit on that front and, for some odd reason, people seem to ignore how they've really been innovative with iTunes.

We could put hundreds of thousands of people to work picking cotton.

We could put hundreds of thousands of people to work in factories spinning said cotton into thread.

We could then put hundreds of thousands more to work weaving that yarn into fabric while yet more sew it into clothing.

The net result is that millions of people are taken away from more important tasks like building robots while the price of clothing skyrockts. Since clothing is now so expensive the people who are not tied up making clothing now have less money to spend on other areas. The loss of efficiency actually removes money from the economy.

Western countries are in a transition from low tech to high tech. It's going to suck, especially since schools are charging enormous sums of money for education.

In the end though, the robots **will** win. Because whatever company choses to be noble and hire good old fashioned human workers to do the job, because they care about people having jobs, will get crushed by the company that uses robots and disappear.

The solution is not to enact laws to stop the robots, it's to educate people so they can perform the new jobs that are created from using robots.

Jobs like programming medical scanners to detect cancer, creating self driving cars, mining space and so many others that we have never even thought about.

The internet is a perfect example. What if it was stopped in its infancy because it was going to threaten the jobs of postal workers. Man, what a loss that would have been. Not just in terms of jobs, but in culture and on business as well.",1360237273,c8ax5z3,t1_c8am2av,technology,t5_2qh16,2013

We don't just need the cars to be able to drive themselves under normal circumstances, but a single central system (probably for each intersection) would need to have exact positioning data for *every* car and probably direct control over each one for a good distance leading up to the intersection as well. We have cars that can handle themselves on a road, we do not have an exact real-time tracking system that can exactly determine the position for a car on the road.

Additionally, they say...

&gt; Right now, you may wind up sitting at a red light for 45 seconds even though no one is passing through the green light in the opposite direction. But you don’t have to do that in a world where traffic flows according to computer communication instead of the systems that have been built with human behavior in mind.

There is an even simpler fix to that particular problem - intersections with sensors to detect when cars are present. These have been massively available for decades and they still aren't universally installed - if they were the wait time in the situation listed is about 5 seconds (max - some even have sensors a ways back leading up to the light so you don't even need to come to a complete stop before the light changes for you if nobody else is present).

Yes this is one possibility of how an intersection may look in the future, but we are nowhere even remotely close to it right now even when discounting the fact that it would never get approval without significantly slowing down in the intersection and significantly increasing the distance between cars - the security risks of having two cars pass feet away from each other even in self driving cars is just reckless.

The reason has to do with a few things. 1 - efficiency, a self driving network of cars can communicate to determine the optimal speed to move the most traffic through a given area. 2 - self driving cars do not get frustrated, and do not show signs of 'road rage' or otherwise emotional driving. 3 - self driving cars can be forced to drive defensively, people can not.

&gt;I agree that self-driving cars are safer BUT we also have to compare how safe they are under certain circumstances.

See, this may be the part where we disagree.  I think overall statistical safety is more important.  So it's true that computers might cause crashes and deaths where there might not have been as many crashes/deaths in the past.  But they'd make up for it by reducing crashes/deaths in other places.

To me this is an acceptable tradeoff.  And naturally Google will be under intense pressure to ensure software updates improve the cars even further.

But we live in a society that is hypocritical.  On the one hand, we are perfectly fine accepting the risk of driving on highways populated by many people who are elderly, slow to react, handicapped in some way, not paying attention, etc.  But on the other hand, when someone suggests a computer drive them around instead, people go crazy - ""You can't do that!  That's irresponsible!  Dangerous!  What would you do if you hit someone??  Think of the children!""

It's an irrational response to a technology that actually improves our lives and reduces the risk of automobile related injury.

Government edicts can only impoverish a society.  They can't add value to society.

- Keep in mind that this is 5-10 years out. Tesla has a $30K vehicle on their roadmap around that time. (*knock on wood*)

I actually think that a Google/Tesla partnership is a great idea and here's why:

Tesla is following Google's philosophy of releasing products early even if all the features aren't in and all the bugs aren't worked out. They have a very aggressive release schedule and mitigate the risk by being nimble enough to catch bugs in the field and respond to them. This is why Tesla chose to 3G connect every vehicle: they capture log data from all vehicles in the fleet at a high rate and they are the only manufacturer that can update vehicle firmware over the air. It's also why NHTSA has no idea what the fuck to do with them (all their policies assume vehicles don't change without a recall). Anyway, I digress. What Tesla is doing with the Model S is essentially the same model as Google's prolonged 'beta' strategy. However, there is a limitation to this strategy. If you release to too many customers too quickly, bugs appear at too high a rate for you to respond quickly. Time is also needed to ramp up support infrastructure (and service stations in Tesla's case). This is why Tesla started with a premium vehicles that most cannot afford and why Google artificially limits new product releases using invites. If Google continues this strategy with its driver-less car, I think they would do well to start with a niche market vehicle like a Tesla.

Looking at Google, going public really hasn't had that big an effect as far as fostering th that sort of myopia.  Just read any of Larry Page's interviews, or look at the stuff they're doing that is the very definition of long-term bets at the expense of the short-term.

That's an incredible long shot: Google has *never* made a car, and they're not exactly a manufacturing giant. Remember, they used a Prius for all of their testing, not a car they built. Google *could* buy a car company and compete that way, but the only company I could imagine them buying would be Tesla, and I don't see that happening. It wouldn't be a move that would make investors happy, and even beyond that it'd probably be overpriced to buy Tesla.

Now, Google could indirectly compete with BMW, by selling software, similar to Microsoft. In a driverless car world, Google would do software, and the normal industry would be your OEMs. But I'm not sure why Google would *compete* with BMW, or any particular company, they'd just sell to any of them I think.

But here comes the problem: Does a car company really want to have to pay Google for software that they can do themselves? They're really not that far behind, and Google is facing an uphill legal fight that will take years. That gives your normal industry a chance to play catch up. Meanwhile, the incremental steps that they're taking are more likely to be accepted by your average consumer (I know my dad for one, would never accept a self driving car).

I think the issue is they will keep trying the incremental approach when most people would be fine with sitting in car and it driving itself.

MS Surface? That is hardly pushing the boundaries or changing the game. If anything it is become a bit of a disaster for MS.

&gt;The automobile represents freedom.

&gt;Not that the SDA will be a problem, but what will be the problem, is that undoubtedly, it will save lives.

&gt;And then the big govey, nanny-statist, lib-progressives will start legislating the SDA into existence and you driving, out of existence.

&gt;It’s all starting to unfold, the soccor-mom safety concerns already here as the nanny-statists try to legislate away the idea of consequences in life.

&gt;Look at how the gun debate is going and where its heading.

&gt;I believe the SDA could eventually, along with other factors, if we don’t arrive there sooner, (a civil war over the gun debate) could be the, or at least one of the precipitating factors, of a civil war.

&gt;It’s about the constitution and your right to be free. Freedom of movement, self-determination, and liberty.

&gt;Kind of like the gun thing.

&gt;But I guess, since the founders didn’t have those nice AR-15’s or SDA back then, it’ll be just as okay, to outlaw driving on your own and make SDA, the law.

&gt;Right?

&gt;Something to think about, eh?

&gt;Maybe we should have the conversation now, instead of waking up to find that along with our right to privacy that we have now been told we have no reasonable expectation of anymore, we retain the right of movement and freedom as laid out in our constitution.

Honestly I think that the USA is going to be a few years behind when it comes to Self-Driving Cars. I figure China will probably adapt to it on a much larger scale, or even many other industrial or western nations faster and more efficiently than the USA: and it will be that which drives the change in our own nation. 

The concept of a Driverless car, or a Self Driven automobile, or whatever we are going to call it isn't something that's going to go away soon. It appears to becoming reality faster and faster and we really should be having much larger conversations in preparation for it. 

Imagine mass scale adaptation of this in a metropolitan area. What about bicycles now? Fine no more Automobile-automobile accidents, but what about a pedestrian that jumps into traffic or a bicyclist that doesn't see the car and no matter how good the car is the accident that is one in a million takes place... what if it goes to court?  Is the driver at fault at all? Is the programmer of the automobile at fault?

Here is another thing, is it discrimination against a person to even have areas that are driver free areas. I mean, it might be safer but now I'm restricted in my access in regards to what means? Are we going to have computer ""oversight"" or potential takeover of control in situations that are illegal?

We're going to have them in our cars now so this will probably also collect all of the data driven with what the computer was doing while automated. I'm assuming in the future that this will be the case, the black box data may not directly hold the logs but it could still track speed/conversation in the ""cabin"" or many other things that most modern cars would never have.

Where will all of this data be saved? How will it be saved? Owned by whom and accessible to whom? Is the entire log of where I went, how I went there, how long I spent there, when I went home now traceable by... the entire general public? Just the corporation? My own personal logs? Do I even have the right to access over the information of my own habits. 

Also, all of the data that these computers use in driving the car will be a contentious conversation. Is an area controlled by a hub master computer that controls the cars in an area? Is each individual car self-focused on the destination it's going to within the boundaries of the programming for traffic laws? There are so many different ways for it to be applied to...

ALSO! I was thinking the fear of ""hacking"" or changing logs of destinations, I know it's far fetched but crimes of the future have to be prepared for. Like the destination was hacked to a ditch at the last second and the driver would never have been the wiser since they were not behind the wheel. Who would even be liable? Would destinations be programmable from outside the computer? I'd hope not, but if the car was being controlled by anything other than itself, by being wirelessly connected to like a driver-less car grid then it could be supposed to be possible. So now we have crime's that aren't prosecutable. 

So now potentially the Police/Judiciary branch, the Taxi, and the trucking/shipping industries could all be potentially opposed.

The number of variables in a racing game compared to the real world is drastically smaller, so a relatively simple program could calculate the inputs necessary to drive an absolutely perfect route around any course in any game. Sometimes fans create ""aftermarket"" AIs for popular older games, with this express purpose - they're little hobby projects for games like Mario, and surprisingly complex projects for games like Starcraft. No matter what game, though, you can be sure a good AI will crush any human player. Hell, look at chess. Grandmasters with decades of experienced got crushed.

449,Sabotage101,"I think we'll see a marriage of self-driving cars and electric-powered cars that will herald the end of their private ownership. A slow shift to more telecommuting will further drive down the need for transportation during the typical peak rush hours. The biggest drawback to private car ownership is their underutilization, and therefore, inefficiency.

At any given time, the percentage of owned cars that are actually in use is fairly small. That leads to huge wastes in both creating more vehicles than the system actually needs to operate and wasted space in building parking lots/garages in densely populated areas for cars just to sit there being useless.

The big downside to electric vehicles is the time required to charge them. If you're driving somewhere and running low on power, most people don't want to stop for an hour and wait for the vehicle to charge. They also don't want to invest in an electric car that takes too long for the savings on gas to overcome the additional price.

Self-driving electric vehicles solve both those problems. Instead of owning your own car, you could just have a subscription to an automated transportation service that costs less than owning your own car. When you need to go somewhere, you press a button in an app on your phone, and an available car in the area arrives within a few minutes to pick you up. Instead of needing to be parked, it drops you off wherever you're going and drives off to pick up someone else.

Electric cars would work well in the system since they any cars low on power could easily drive to a charging station in between trips to recharge without inconveniencing an actual passenger. If an unplanned trip put it really low on power while a passenger was inside, it could drive to a charging station and be swapped out for another car that was alerted to the need for a transfer while it charges.

Once the technology gets there, the efficiency of automatic transportation and sharing the cost of ownership will simply out-compete private ownership for most people. Owning your own car will just become a luxury that costs 10x more than subscribing to a service.",1363379141,c8wbs3p,t1_c8w82by,technology,t5_2qh16,2013

Like the idea that you need a dedicated device for every specific function. The kind of predictions that say, ""You can make a record in your own home!"". Well, we can do that. People are already experimenting with 3D-printing their own records. That's awesome, but we solved the issue with MP3's about a decade ago, and they've since become ubiquitous. There's basically nothing to replace digital media. But there's an assumption there. Music -&gt; Delivered to your home -&gt; printed with a replication device. Nobody back then would think ""well, you could just stop at Step 2"".

I think predictions would become a whole lot more accurate if more people stopped getting ahead of themselves and said, ""well, we're assuming these two things will exist, but would you really need both at that point?"".

A self-driving car may do better then humans (who really really suck at driving; 90% at least of all accidents are caused by the human factor) but it will never be as safe as a proper tracked vehicle that's automated will. And when I say ""tracked"" I'm not talking about some antiquated train but a modern, fast, safe automated PRT system or something similar.

Automated cars are a huge sidetrack. It's cheaper to build elevated track than road. As well as safer, transport is faster and it's child's play to automate since you don't have to worry about things like road conditions or collisions with anything except the other vehicles - that the computer always knows where they are, so that's a non-issue.

467,kurtseifried,"What I find most amusing:

 1) The cars have trouble detecting lane markers when there is snow on the road.

This is also true of people. Right now (Edmonton) we just had a major snowfall two days ago and people made a right mess of it:

http://www.edmontonjournal.com/RCMP+trying+untangle+mess+created+QEII+crashes+south+Edmonton/8138000/story.html

""RCMP are grappling with the aftermath of a massive series of snow-related collisions on the Queen Elizabeth II Highway south of Leduc that involved up to 100 vehicles and injured more than 100 people.""

What is especially interesting is that we seem to average ~200 collisions anytime we have a major snowfall after a period of good weather (it seems that people forget how to drive in snow given a few weeks of nice weather). 

I literally find myself on larger roads thinking ""is this 2 or 3 or 4 lanes, do I need to be dead center, or slightly left/right of center, or should I just follow the set of tracks that seem slightly deeper"", and with other cars around you basically keep your spacing, lane markers really only matter if you have traffic going at very different rates of speed (and slow people actually keep to the right). 

 2) They can get lost when they come to changes in the road that aren’t on the map.

So do people. Witness the number of GPS related ""oopsies"" where people drive into lake or down dirt roads or end up in the middle of the Australian outback.

 3) They have trouble understanding when traffic cops direct traffic with hand signals.

Yeah again, people tend to suck at this, it happens so rarely that most everyone forgot, and even at construction sites where you have someone holding a sigh saying ""Stop"" (because you know, cement truck is backing in) I see people ignoring that stuff. 

In other words self driving cars might have problems with these issues, but so do regular people drivers. The question is will self driving cars do it safer and I suspect the answer is ""yes"" in the longer term (20-50 years no question).

468,NicknameAvailable,"&gt; PRTs do exist, and could be implemented on a block-by-block functionality, covering an entire city in fewer than three years, with forced re-housing and destruction of current roads (to force obsoletion of most cars, which have no point and no value). No one should own a car now, but most people are too stupid to actually advocate for the ideal, because they're content with 'good enough', which clearly isn't. Under your system, Denver could have a PRT, but, say, ABQ wouldn't have to... which is similarly bullshit.

Ignoring the part that it is entirely immoral to uproot people from their homes for a new transit system you think is better.  I'm guessing from this you live in a city.  PRT's _aren't_ a solution for rural areas (about 20% of the US population).  They aren't even a wise decision for places that aren't major cities.  Money is a quantitative measure of how much in the way of materials and labor (to some extent time, but excluding it because the difference is insignificant unless you are trying to deliberately rush things, which for the sake of this discussion I'll concede isn't a priority as it would further demonstrate my case if it were) it costs to do something.  We live in a world of finite resources - are fossil fuels the best answer?  Yes, actually right now they still are.  To replace all the roads with PTRs you would be looking at a massive initial investment in the same resource consumption you are trying to eliminate by their substitution (and remember, most of the fossil fuel use isn't even for private transportation, it's for power - the very same power that will be driving the bulk of the PTRs).  If you are looking for a green solution, roads are not the place to start unless you are in a city that can benefit from them otherwise (everyone knows driving in a city _blows_, there is room for improvement there and more importantly for a new technology, there is a testing ground to start ramping up production and deploying/debugging it rather than buying an entire nation worth of PTR pods and rails and having them all fall to shit in the very same way - change is incremental or catastrophic, there is no happy middle ground to be had there).  In terms of a free market, if you look at companies like zip car - if they catch on they will expand, if you look at Google's self-driving cars, they aren't developing that for nothing.  The next logical step will be a PTR-type system, but it is an incremental step that will have to work within the rules people set (this isn't simcity, you can't just bulldoze a neighborhood full of people because you think the benefits of putting a PTR in and rebuilding all the homes outweighs the negatives, even _if_ that held true [an enormous assumption for a new technology] - those aren't _your_ lives to uproot, _you_ don't get to make that call, _they_ do).

&gt; This is the problem I have with your focus. People can do what they want under very few circumstances... they still have to pay bills, they still have to seek employment, etc. I propose that true freedom is economic freedom, and that it can only be achieved by intellectuals forcing the mundanes to accept what's best for them.

You don't _have_ to pay bills or get a job, it's just _much_ easier to survive by doing so.  It is perfectly possible to go live in the woods off fish and berries.  That kind of lifestyle wouldn't support our entire population, but it's a shitty enough existence it doesn't have to, because it's a hell of a lot easier to get a job and pay your bills to pick berries, build a shelter from sticks and fish every day - not to mention it's much more fulfilling having access to technology.  Economic freedom comes from hard work, not intellectuals forcing mundanes to accept what is best for them (take it from someone with an IQ of 191 who scored in the top 0.0001-0.000001 percentile [depending on the precision of the test] in dozens of aptitude tests) - even if you could force people to adapt to what is ""best"" for them, you don't know what is best for them, nobody does because every fucking day we are in uncharted territory with new technologies, political scenarios, characters acting it all, etc.  The best statistical projections we have are still just that, political systems are no different from quantum mechanics - you can get most of the details right, but every now something is going to tunnel across the fucking universe to your utter amazement.  A new technology will come along and make you go ""wow, investing in all those solar cells was a really dumb idea now that we have fusion - perhaps even dumber that we shut down our fusion testbed and let the europeans lead the charge in the technology"" or perhaps something goes catastrophically wrong (a chemical in the manufacturing process of whoever bullshitted their way through the grant process to mass produce the solar panels and PTR's causes cancer, or simply fails catastrophically causing the device to stop working after 6 months instead of the projected 20 years and the ""green"" project that was only barely fitting of the name to begin with is now very much not).

TL;DR: You don't have the answers, no one does - it's a dynamic system, if you change one thing you inadvertently change everything so the only logical solution is reduce the impact of every change to a level at which it won't fuck things up too badly and crowd-source the solutions to the local populace - the good things will spread and the bad things won't, the same process has been happening for millions of years on a biological level and it's the only design process we really know works.  Ascribing to one system of political belief is not the answer, because they're all fucking wrong to some degree.",1364113953,c91et2v,t1_c91egc9,technology,t5_2qh16,2013

No, it is the only moral action: It would be the greatest benefit for the greatest number of people (along with similar changes throughout all of society's tech fields, such as implementing vertical farming and the like).

&gt; PRT's aren't a solution for rural areas (about 20% of the US population).

We should not allow people to live in rural areas, as it serves no benefit to the people involved or to society.

&gt; same resource consumption you are trying to eliminate by their substitution

Er... who said anything about eliminating consumption?  PRTs use less of the same energy, sure, but that's a non-central function... a nice perk.  It'd be part of a broader annihilation of the societal push for humans to waste their time and energy... look how many hours, every day, are dedicated purely to driving, which accomplishes exactly nothing unique.

Google's probably one of the few examples of a company being willing to sacrifice a bit and risk more to be able to accomplish the best, but ideally speaking, they could make a ton more money than they are by *not*, which means that they're only succeeding by violating the capitalistic freemarket standard...

It's no different that any other subjugation of people through history.

&gt; We should not allow people to live in rural areas, as it serves no benefit to the people involved or to society.

Aside from the fact we need rural areas for things like agriculture and gathering of the resources our society is built upon.  The most intellectual people on the planet come from rural areas.  Cities are too active to foster intellectual minds - people become too focused on petty interpersonal skills to develop higher reasoning.  Your goal of an intellectual dictatorship would die within a few generations.

&gt; Er... who said anything about eliminating consumption? PRTs use less of the same energy, sure, but that's a non-central function... a nice perk. It'd be part of a broader annihilation of the societal push for humans to waste their time and energy... look how many hours, every day, are dedicated purely to driving, which accomplishes exactly nothing unique.

This will happen sooner from automation than from PRT's, and freeing people up time-wise has it's own setbacks - all the people bitching about nothing too do, needing work, etc.  The average person isn't highly motivated, they are a lazy sack of crap that wouldn't have survived the evolutionary process if we didn't cut it off with our modern society.  A lack of necessity is a nice ideal, but it's a false one - even the entrepreneurs go out of their way to trick themselves into thinking they have more to strive for and it's never enough - we are relatively instinctual creatures, if fed, clothed and fucked the average person doesn't care for much else.

&gt; They're developing it because people are too stupid to use proven technology until they're given some happy mediation-step bullshit. Same as the Glass. Same as Fibrehoods. Google's probably one of the few examples of a company being willing to sacrifice a bit and risk more to be able to accomplish the best, but ideally speaking, they could make a ton more money than they are by not, which means that they're only succeeding by violating the capitalistic freemarket standard...

That isn't a violation of a capitalistic free market, that _is_ the capitalistic free market.  It is designed to put wealth into the hands of people best equipped to deploy it.  There are many examples beyond Google - Elon Musk aiming for Mars and the Russian billionaire (can't think of his name off the top of my head) aiming for immortality down to local businesses striving to provide better than everyone else in their area - the failings of capitalism are highly publicized but they are exceedingly rare.

&gt; IQ of 188 here, and IQ doesn't give you authority, you should know that.

Oh I'm sorry, that was my point.  Apparently if you think you are on top you find it acceptable that the intellectuals should dictate how everyone else live, but if you're not apparently that changes - how odd.

&gt; Further, intelligence and intellectuality aren't directly related.

The exact definition of ""intellectuality"" is actually ""relating to intelligence"".  If you were going to say IQ but didn't because you just made a point of writing yours then by all means, point out a better metric?  Perhaps aptitude?  Financial success?  Political prowess?  Or is it whoever _feels_ more intellectual.  You know it's perfectly OK to admit you want to be a dictator and ruin people's lives for the sport of it - your ideas are just as wrong either way (morally and when applied to reality).

&gt; No, it should be granted. That you assume it a barrier is the problem; It's no reason to be.

Money represents work, resources, time - things that are finite.  How would you deal with people that just didn't feel like working, or felt like working half as hard as everyone else - or just slacking off whatever amount they could get away with?  They most certainly exist, you're surrounded by them every day (assuming you have the misfortune of needing to be around them, assuming you are since you are apparently one of the city-dwelling people living on top of one another like some kind of communal nesting insect).  Perhaps labor camps (or prisons, pretty much the same under such a system)?  Maybe government sponsored mental cleansing?  Chinese style execution vans?  Or are you just playing Ostrich on this point and assuming people will work merrily away for whatever pittance they are allowed after the fruits of their labor are distributed to everyone else?

&gt; except we know exactly our capabilities, and we should work to implement them, because they are directly better right fucking now.

They are _always_ better _right fucking now_ so long as we research - it takes time to get things into practice because shit doesn't happen instantly, people have to design specific implementations for each task, other people have to build it, other people have to secure resources, other people have to coordinate it all, other people have to be keeping up to date on _what_ to implement.  To do as you say we could halt all our research, refocus our efforts on upgrades and be stagnant for a decade, whereas in the current system if something better comes along before everything has been upgraded then hey, we haven't just wasted trillions of dollars on a nation-wide rail system, or monorail system, or self-driving car system, or whatever else comes down the line because we always have improving technology and it gets progressively better and cheaper upon implementation.  Again, this is not Sim City, this is reality - you can't hit pause build everything then hit go, it's always going and people can't wait for some idiotic bureaucratic mind to go ""lets do this"", then ""learn"" how, then fuck it up and give up having wasted a fuckload of money (yet another way it's not like Sim City - the government _almost always_ fucks up compared to the ideal implementation).

&gt; Again, I was speaking of the ideals. The society is the entity, the individuals are non-consequential. I'm not advocating for tearing up cities as such, but it is a viable option, and it is a direct, measurable benefit.

China is in the process of doing this right now - the results aren't that great.  People cut corners to meet deadlines, the workers are unhappy with the work and the quality drops as a result, etc.  In order to do this single aspect of what you suggest we would have to add incentive to have people retrain and become proficient as (not the same thing) skilled laborers specific to demolition and construction, this would take away from labor available in other areas like manufacturing (which contrary to popular belief is still thriving in some parts of the US, typically the more rural areas like New England).

Ideals are absolutely meaningless beyond the fact they are used by politicians to garner votes.  You know what hope and idealism are?  Stupidity and weakness - a lack of reality.

&gt; Explain to me, then, why people ever used smartphones, then, considering they were obsolete before they were commercially introduced?

You bring them somewhere with winter and they do not work, even rain can cause problems. Detecting exact amounts of snow or ice is also not easy without getting out and digging down to see what is there. Computers aren't going to magically get this information.

They use cameras to read road lines and signs like humans do, things that disappear in the winter. You also can't replace that with precise GPS because you'd be wrong even if you could be accurate to within an inch or two. 

Lanes move in the winter because people can't see the lines, it's not uncommon to be driving along and suddenly find a clear spot of road and notice that everyone is driving in the shoulder and the marked lane is 3 feet to the left of you. This information while interesting doesn't mean you move over 3 feet either, you stay right where you are and the lanes move back later once snow is cleared.

I think this will be one of the largest things holding back self driving cars. Dealing with weather can be solved but I wouldn't be surprised if it delays self driving cars by decades.",1394230941,cfx23kq,t1_cfwy0l1,technology,t5_2qh16,2014

* Self driving cars are already legal in Michigan, California, Nevada, and Florida (for research purposes at the least).  Colorado actually shot one bill down in February 2013 if I remember correctly.  The laws vary from state to state so I'd suggest you check them out individually.  I think they all require a human driver, but they differ on the details.
* Self driving cars are currently very expensive to construct and we will likely not see them on the market (for everyday people) for a long time, not until we can make them work safely AND cheaply.  This is actually where some of my research is done.
* What we do see in the mass market will be incremental and we already have some things.  Think automatic parallel parking or adaptive cruise control.
* Insurance will definitely be key to all of the legal issues with self driving cars.  I'm basically repeating /u/kulmbach but I really don't think that can be stressed enough.
* The major car companies are all on board with the idea as far as I'm aware so this *shouldn't* be like some areas of technology where progress is held up by stubborn business people that refuse to change their business models to incorporate actual innovation.
* Sorry if any of these are repeated elsewhere in this thread.

Depth won't matter much, because what needs to be measured is traction. Keep in mind that a self-driving car has far better control of itself than a human driver could ever have. If the car slips, the vehicle could take immediate action to recover.

Add in some GPS or stored route data and you could have cars memorize where lanes are. It's all doable with current technology, it just requires some development and an algorithm to take into account traction, vehicle weight, and any other relevant factors to reach a maximum safe speed. Then a quick-action recovery system for hitting ice patches and such. Already you'll see far fewer accidents with less damage. If LiDar can be developed such that it can reliably see patches of water or ice that may result in traction issues, then that will allow it to predicatively slow or avoid hazards.",1394235778,cfx45w8,t1_cfx23kq,technology,t5_2qh16,2014

I'm not saying they can't work, just that it's much more complicated then you think. LiDar can only tell a car so much about road conditions and managing different weather conditions is going to be a big problem.

In theory there could be real time data covering everything within sensor range outside the vehicle. Cameras seeing everything to the front and LiDAR seeing 360 degrees 10 times a second. You can learn a great deal from LiDAR data.

It will be possible to track every other vehicle within range on the road and work out where it might be heading, if it is slowing down for something (maybe checking out the 'Sale' sign outside a shop). We will instantaneously know what the local traffic volume and patterns are.

Combined with the LiDAR it will be able to track every pedestrian and bicyclist etc. From the data it will be possible to extrapolate height, weight, sex, age? etc. and see what each person is doing and if there is a pattern to behaviour that has any commercial value so someone.
It will be possible to monitor any new static items that have appeared in the street - maybe a cafe has placed tables and chairs out for the first time that year as the weather has improved etc. etc.

Actually building the system needed to automate claims adjustment requires companies changing their workflow, either slowly over time or in one big push that could break a lot of stuff. It's a lot harder to convince people of a shake-up when the change won't pay for itself immediately.

As far as information gathering goes, you could have the people enter it. The thing is a black box. Or you could have it scan IDs or something and automatically chew through the data. Or gather it from another source. But a lot of the stuff *could* be automated. Most statistics are already gathered by third-parties. You'd just need to input it into a database and let it work out the risk factors. It'd be really easy to do for vehicles and the like. Then once you have a personal record, modifying it with prior incidents is relatively easy. There's DMV records, etc, that are already computerized. Someday, we'll hopefully get medical records into a proper format that's easy to shuffle around. The math is all there, it just needs to be lumped into a cohesive system.

Cars aren't just driven on urban roads with a planned out route. They need to be driven into tight spots, weird parkings, unmapped areas, offroad... they need to avoid potholes and puddles, they need to be wary of snow that's just been blown on the road, they need to watch the sky for that weird branch on top of that tree that's about to fall, and they need to watch out for that kid who has just started running from the other side of the street and will jump in front of your car at any second.

It was just 2 generations ago that people were mining with pick and shovel and pit ponies. A team of two would work a 12 hour shift and shovel 20 tonnes of coal. Coal mining has gone through huge leaps in mechanization and now we mine more coal in 1 day than 500 men did in a whole year (2 generations ago).

Instead of that, let's look at generic object detection and recognition! This is much easier. Generic object detection and recognition would be an absolute boon to many fields. Robotics would have a golden age now that they can reliably interact with environments visually. Conservationists can reliably track and identify animal populations. Visual aids can be developed for the blind. Self driving cars will be a widespread reality. I would venture to guess that lots of people want and would actively research these capabilities. In fact, I don't need to venture as it's been happening for years and is still very active today.

Now here's the problem: face detection is *easy* compared to generic object detection. Faces have so much structure to them that if you have *reliable* generic object detection and recognition algorithms they'll perform *even better* on faces. In fact, the deep learning architectures being modified to perform face detection and recognition started off as generic object classifiers!

Suburban users have to pay a heavy surcharge and higher per-mile rates to cover the expense of that empty trip to come get them.  You're underestimating the cost savings of cutting out the driver by a significant margin.

Automated cars could very well be cheap enough for long distance commuting.  The only difference between a shared self-driving car service and a private self-driving car should amount of the initial capital investment versus a small surcharge per ride.  They would ultimately be the same exact type of vehicle participating in the same centrally-orchestrated system. Chances are that because it's a shared resource utilized more efficiently than private cars (no parking fees, for instance), the overall cost to users would be lower for the service than for privately owned vehicles. There are certainly benefits to self driving cars in long distance commutes - smaller head spaces and more efficient traffic patterns, no parking requirement at the destination, etc. 

But even if they were not viable for that, people don't need to take taxis for 30 mile commutes.  They can certainly use them to get to the train station.  People currently have to weigh the expense of owning a car and paying for commuter parking as well as the train fare against just driving to the city and paying for parking there.  When you enable cheap reliable car service in the suburbs, it allows them to both perform local errands and get to their mass transit options without having to own a car (or a second or third car, as many suburban homes do).

170,ArchangelleAnnRomney,"I think I understand the point you're making about meritocracy, and why it bothers some people.  I think that given github's goal of growing a more diverse user base, there's a persuasive argument there for changing the motto.   

Also, I think, a change like this would be a reasonable accommodation to make to support a diverse work force.  

I don't think the existence of that rug is evidence of any kind of sexism.  IMHO, it's unreasonable to expect that others agree that meritocracy is a offensive idea.  People are entitled to their feelings, and fundamentally, the meritocracy concept as applied to open source software is derived from a system that technologists know works and stretches back to before the Cathedral and the Bazaar essay in the Mythical Man Month.  To inject social justice ideas into that concept is to inject politics into an otherwise apolitical realm.  

And fundamentally, that's what this entire discussion is about:  politics.  I want you to consider this statement you made in your prior comment:

&gt; Meritocracy also features strongly in the capitalist, Ayn Rand section of the US, championed by businesspeople whom, surely I need not remind you, are largely white men.

There's an implicit assumptions in here that you should question:  That capitalism is odious because it's supported only by white men, and because they benefit from it.  

We could make the same argument about social justice:  it's advocates are largely women and minorities, who would benefit from social justice ideas.  That doesn't discredit social justice ideas in anyway.  It doesn't prove that we wouldn't have a better society if we adopted these ideas.

I'm not an objectivist, but I am capitalist (and FWIW, I'm not a white male but at least you said capitalists are ""largely"" white men.)  I suspect by your comments that you do not identify as a capitalist and that you might be comfortable with being labeled a socialist or even a communist. I think we could draw the line at this conversation on that note, as I think all of our major differences would derive from that point of view.  I think you'd disagree with my POV that capitalism and the free market are what enables awesome things like Facebook, self driving cars, google glasses and github to exist.

So I won't try to argue that point directly.  But, as a thought experiment on the idea of affirmative action, and your question of what better ideas there are, let's consider the ongoing conversation the technologists have been having with social justice advocates within our community.

The tech community has been told that diversity makes for better teams.  There's research that proves it, and largely, we're all on board.  We want more diverse teams in our industry.  

We've been told that sometimes, our language and our behavior makes some people uncomfortable.  It prevents us from having diverse teams and from having some of our team members feel comfortable and be productive.  We need to give up some degree of the casualness in our workplaces.  We're largely on board with this.  Sure, there are still some bad apples, but most folks in our community are behind making changes so we can move forward.

We're asked to change our recruiting practices, to change and redirect our message so that we reach out better to women and minorities.  We're asked to give the disadvantaged a second look, and the benifit of the doubt.  We're largely supportive of this idea.  

Then, we're asked to outright change our hiring practices.  We're asked to pick less than qualified candidates over more qualified candidates based on race or gender.  We're asked to work with teammates who are less experienced.  Working with competent people is something we value, and it's a sacrifice some are hesitant to make.  I'll knowledge, it's also a sacrifice much less common than discussed, but it's still controversial.  

More controversial still, is what's coming next.  The conversation around Horvath included a large amount of criticism for business minimalism and flat corporations.  For example, [in this piece, Code for America organizer Catherine Bracy argues that github suffers from a want of bureaucracy, and that bureacracy is essential for building diverse teams.](http://cbracy.tumblr.com/post/79876957198/the-github-debacle-and-why-holacracy-is-bullshit)  

No thanks on that.  Flat corporate structure is awesome, and it produces awesome things.  I have no interest in working in an environment where I can't revert someone else's commit without getting a managers approval.  I've worked in bureaucractic institutions, and I've seen first hand the exponential differences in what bureacracies produce vs. what startups produce.  There's a reason why HealthCare.gov will end up costing between $170 and $300 million, while equivalently complex startups are able to launch with a few thousand dollers and a few months of sweat equity.  I want to work on a team that produces software in weeks, not years.  I'll wager most of our community would agree with me on this.  

I am interested in creating opportunities for the disadvantaged.  But I think there's a point where we need to question whether the ideas of social justice warriors are going to be effective, and whether they're worth the cost.  You claim that this is about building a better civilization, but I like building things like GPS-enabled software for devices, and I like living in a civilization that can afford them.  I don't think I'd enjoy living under a communist regime, which increasingly, is what it sounds like social justice advocates want.  

You asked if I had a ""better way of solving the problem"".  

I think the first step is preserving our capitalist system and preserving our meritocracies.  A focus on excellence in technology creates opportunities for everyone, disadvantaged and privileged.  

I think we need to focus on equality of opportunity, over equality of outcome.   I think we need investments in education, much bigger ones than we're making.  I think we need to do a better job getting technology into the hands of young women, the poor and minorities.  I think we continue making investments in making our community and the things we build more accessible to everyone.

And I think we need more innovators.  If the promises SJWs make are true, let's see them in action.  I think there are two few social justice advocates who have started enterprises that prove that their ideas have merit.  I admire Julie Ann Horvath's strength of character.  Does she have the perseverance to launch her own enterprise, one that demonstrates that workplace she envisions can thrive and produce great things?

Apple is one of the most profitable companis in the world, and what are they doing with that money? Mostly just sitting on it, and maybe buying back some stock. They could be sinking tens of billions in to far fetched R&amp;D projects, and it would have barely any effect on their balance sheet. They could cut the price of their phone in half and still sell them profitably and they would capture much more market share (which would be good for long term profitability). They could be giving away cheap laptops all over the world. But what are they doing? Selling iPhones that look mostly the same as 3 years ago at enormous profit.

Google gives away most of the services and technology that are the product of some of the best and brightest engineers in the world for free, and they keep giving away more stuff all the time. And what do they do with all the revenue they get from selling ads? They sink it in to wild moonshot projects like Glass or self driving cars or balloon internet access for the rest of the world or investing in fibre internet or scanning books or making the best maps that have ever existed.

Apple or Microsoft or Cisco or Facebook could've spent some of their money on any one of those, either to beat everyone else to the market or to try and be competitive in the future or just to see if they could.

189,MoreThanOnce,"Okay, I'm seeing a lot of doom and gloom here, so I thought I'd post some optimistic possibilities for this merger. I'm not saying that any of this is going to happen, but I am saying it is possible:

1. Oculus might remain a mainly independent entity within Facebook. Similar to how Nest was recently acquired by Google - thermostats aren't really part of Google's portfolio, but they're still selling thermostats. Having another profit stream could help facebook move away from relying on ad revenue - keep it more stable as a company moving forward. Licensing and selling hardware helps them grow as a company, and they don't need to mess with Oculus to do that.

2. Facebook has a lot of infrastructure that can help Oculus. That kind of money means they aren't wasting time courting investors. The influence of Facebook means that they would have a better chance of being able to push open web standards forward which could support VR. I had a chance the other week to try out James McCrae's work on [FireBox](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~mccrae/projects/firebox/), which is a really cool way of exploring the internet. Unfortunately, translating HTML and CSS into a 3D environment is difficult. Facebook, being one of the largest companies on the web, could help encourage the creation of new HTML and CSS standards for 3D browsing support.

Just because Facebook doesn't have experience in this area doesn't mean they're going to mess it up. They make quality products - messenger is great, instagram (which they acquired) remains strong, and they have an infrastructure capable of handling 4,000 photo uploads every second. Google was once just a search engine which relied on ads for their revenue. Now they have self-driving cars, a majority of the cellphone market, and are exploring robotics and AI. Companies grow. Big ones acquire the little ones and diversify, or they grow stagnant, especially in tech. 

I don't know which way this will go. It could be terrible, they could just take the talented developers and ship them off to other products. But it could give Oculus the support it needs to finally ship a finished VR that's consumer friendly, and has wide industry support.

I'm sure we'll see some prototypes with partial automation, such as the ability to follow lanes on highways or such, but to think that there will be software capable of controlling cars which can be deployed in every city regardless of local and national laws, designs, and habits is idealistic.

Not to mention the pain in the ass of having to design software capable of dealing with human drivers.

What we're going to see is a gradual roll out of automation technology over the next several generations of cars. With some luck, 90% of cars will be partially automated in 15 years.

Yes.

Why do you think manufacturers develope self-driving cars? Spending hundreds of millions of dollar for fun? ""Yeah, I want those engineers to waste time developing something I never intend to equip my cars with anyway.""

Also, I doubt that there will be liability for the manufacturers (at least not any more than already is there).

People will still be fully responsible for what happens. All self-driving cars will still have manual control and the self-driving is just a feature they can use. You know... the same way you are 100% responsible for checking your lights, mirrors, oil, battery, tire air pressure, first aid kit, and engine *ever single time before you start your car*? A legal requirement? 

Yeah. All these things will be perfectly fine because your car manufacturer has installed a display in modern cars displaying any defective parts of your car. That still doesn't make them liable if one of these things is not okay and you have an accident because of it.    
It is *your* car and *your* responsibility. *You* are responsible for using a feature of said car. Just because your car can go 300mph it doesn't mean your manufacturer is responsible for you using that feature and losing control.

Cars already are highly automated vehicles with the car doing most stuff (navigation is automated, parking is automated, turning the wheels is automated, braking is automated, changing gear is automated, etc.). Yeah, you are turning the wheel and pushing pedals and buttons but ultimately the car is doing most of the work.

Trying to equate a smart phones ability to bring utility to its user, and a vehicle that can handle itself on the road is not even close to the situation here. Please let me take a moment from my own life and give you a bit of a perspective on driving, from a PROFESSIONALS stand point. 

I've been a [prof.] truck driver, for 5 years now. In that time, I've accumulated over 6,000 hours of operating heavy equipment and around 550,000 miles as of about last month. I used to drive OTR (over the road), I now drive locally as a dump truck driver in the summer time, and I drive vocational vehicles for CSX &amp; Norfolk southern during the winter. The biggest issue with expecting a vehicle to drive itself is the unpredictability of roads. What is your smart car gonna do, when it comes up to my 80,000 lb dump truck backing onto an unmarked and temporary service road to dump a load of gravel, and fails to notice the fact that I had to take all 4 lanes of a us highway to do so. 
What is this magical technological mega-leap going to do in inclement weather? As a professional driver I have leagues of experience over the general motoring public, and still manage to fuck up in bad weather (granted not as badly as you guys, but still bad enough that I chastise myself in my own head.)
I really could probably do a dissertation on this topic, and I've come close to doing it over on the Truckers Report [website for truckers] and that has come to a lot of disagreements and arguments about the unlikely/likely-hood of such a vehicle ever being let loose on public roads.I personally think it's unlikely on a lot of fronts. 
Least of which is the saftey perspective and cost of such vehicles, most of which is that at the end of the day; I don't think most people would honestly want to own a vehicle that could drive itself when they're only preforming this task for what is, a relatively short period in their day...",1396147420,cgfdnjg,t1_cgfd787,technology,t5_2qh16,2014

 -Reconfigurable clusters (as opposed to buttons)

I love buttons and knobs, no matter who drives my car, I know where my AC, music, and warning lights buttons are and they've been there for the 9 years of my car's life. Why do I need buttons that can move?? Why would I need buttons that my future kids can mess with and I won't realize have been reconfigured until I reach for them (probably when I'm driving.)??

 -large touchscreen

I don't want a touchscreen. I want a car that'll last me 10+ years, I don't want, essentially, a ten year old tablet attached to my car.  Give me my timeless knobs and I'll update the radio, I guess, if I ever want to.

 -Embedded telematics

This, I'll admit, might  be because I drive an older car and don't know any better but I not only do i not mind not having blue tooth connectivity (I have an auxhilary cable), but i also I don't think I'd care about a different way of connecting to the outside world while in my car. When I get a car with bluethooth,  that'll probably be adequate. 

 - cloud based software 

I'll chalk this up to ignorance but I don't care to have my car's software updated, and I don't mind if  my car's company doesn't have data on my car. If someone could enlighten me as to why I should want those things, go ahead, I never shy away from learning something new, but for now that is filed under ""things that are not a selling point for my future car.""

I'm all for advances in technology and am constantly purchasing the newest thing,  but when it comes to the technology in my car, I'm pretty attached to the way cars are configured now. Except for the self driving. Ohhhh, how I am excited for self driving :D

Oculus is a great acquisition for Facebook since it can feel free to explore it (as Google does with wearables/self-driving car) without any pressure from investors to immediately monetize off it. 

Facebook was slow to realize mobile was the platform to focus on (unlike Apple and Google who essentially shaped what it looks like today).

Most people won't be able to or will see the sense in not owning their own self driving car, which means fleets for rent will be the most common. You'll have different levels of fleet for different price ranges. At first it might be expensive to have a self driving car all to yourself at rush hour, but if you're willing to carpool there will be a sedan that picks you up and three other people on the way going to the same general destination (the reservation programs will be able to optimize). Maybe you can get a discount for having a standing, pre-arranged carpool scheduled m-f indefinitely. Then if you really want to save money, there will be self driving minivans - more crowded and might take a little longer to pick up and drop off everyone but still a step above driving yourself.

Or, you could own your own self driving car if you have the cash, and lease it to a fleet during the hours you're not using it - I'm not sure how you would handle any damages or cleaning of the car but I imagine there would be jobs to be had there. Or you might offset the cost by loaning it out to friends and family when you're not using it.

For those who don't follow Nascar, the track looks like this: http://www.nascar.com/en_us/sprint-cup-series/schedule/tracks/sonoma-raceway.html and is probably one of the single most difficult races run in a standard car body.

And this, my friend, is why your test is utter garbage: you fail to acknowledge that you as a driver are not perfect and that a significant portion of your fellow drivers are terrifyingly bad. The Google cars have been in one accident in &gt;300k miles and that one was because the human in the car was driving to the testing location. If we replaced every human driver with Google cars tomorrow and disabled the steering wheel for everything but parking there would be fewer accidents tomorrow. The perfection fallacy, that something limited or imperfect can't be an improvement, is what you're falling into here and if you applied the same standards to yourself, you never would have been allowed to start driving either.


Regarding performance in turns and at high speeds, this is a sample of what happens when you throw water in the middle of a turn at high speed on an automated car from BMW. The car can handle loss of traction quite well but it's not going to intentionally start or maintain that state because there isn't a reason to any more than there is a reason to accelerate to 120 and run itself into the nearest telephone pole.

For the love of God, you people pretending you're going to find some physical action that you're going to outperform a machine at is ridiculous. You've been doing it since the steam engine and have never been right for very long once the prices come down to practical levels on the machine components. The only reason you're still better at any given physical task is because you're cheaper than making a machine for that one specific task or it's too difficult to convince you (collectively) you're wrong for the 5,489,323rd time. If it weren't so hard to convince you that you're wrong, we could easily stick a few inexpensive LIDAR sensors and cameras in the bumpers and have cars doing highway driving themselves (with significantly fewer accidents than the average driver) and save lives.

If someone has a drunk friend, there's a system to call a car to take someone else to a set destination - this is also used by parents who don't have time to take their children to school, and probably some other categories of people. Cleaning is, again, dealt with by a mixture of user reports and cameras inside of cars.

Roving taxis are dealt with by having an interface inside the car; to avoid people refusing to pay, they must register a valid payment method before the car will take them anywhere. Alternatively, simply require everyone who wishes to use the system to install an app, and allow other companies to provide service to people who don't want to install an app. Those companies charge more - because they have less ability to impose punitive fines on their users to enforce good behavior - but use much of the same technology.",1396205100,cgft1e9,t1_cgfsebl,technology,t5_2qh16,2014

The trick is to do it in a computationally efficient way, which is why we'd have to reduce the problem to either 1) the available latency/bandwidth for off-core algorithms or 2) the bulkier size/heat/engineering associated with on-core processing.

1. The border. Technically an out-of-country plated car isn't supposed to be used by local residents, at least if a good many Canadian and American border guards are to be believed. Say I need to be taken from small-town Montana to Calgary. It wouldn't be legal for it to serve someone else in Calgary if it's an American-plated vehicle, and the US border would be some five hours away. If it were Canadian-plated then it wasn't supposed to pick me up and take me to Calgary. If the solution is a hand-off at the border I can't imagine even semi-frequent border-crossers bothering with it all.

2. Tracking. You have a pretty solid way of seeing where someone's been and/or where they're going. *Someone's* going to complain. If a data leak happens, even worse.

3. In-between stops on long trips. Going back to the trip to Calgary example, that's eight hours of driving. If the passenger either can't or has to pay extra to stop the car to take a leak or stretch their legs or something that would be problematic at best.

4. Cost. You really think people who have just paid off their cars (or bought cheap, sub-$5k cars) are going to ditch them for something that's going to cost more? Not happening.

388,BWalker66,"I kinda disagree with long distance rail now because of advances in self driving cars.

A new high speed interstate rail line going across a few states would probable cost close to $100 BILLION, thats an insane amount of money. A huge amount of resources too as lines of metal 100s of miles long have to be laid across the ground. And the most important part is that for something that long you can bet that it most likely won't be open for public for 15 years after it has started, so about 2035? All this for what is essentially what is like a 2 lane road, but for trains.

But instead by 2035, if we pumped that kind of money($100billion, or even half of that) into self driving cars, we would pretty much almost certainly have cars capable of driving themselves 100%. If these cars can drive themselves so they're essentially like trains that use roads, everybody would like have their own carriage that can pick them up from their door step(don't need to own the car just as you wouldn't with a train) right to their destination, instead of having to get to a train station. They'd also be able to go almost anywhere in the country, not just a few predefined routes.

But even if thats not here by 2035, if it's not common place by as late as 2050 then that would still mean this rail system that was built for $100 billion would only be beneficial to people for those 15 years, sounds like a bad investment.

If the US can build high speed rail far quicker than the UK can(which is where most of my estimates come from, search ""HS2""), and also far cheaper, then go for it, but by the way its going down in the UK(just 120miles, for about $100+billion, and won't be done by 2032), then it just doesn't seem worth it. Thats a crazy amount of money and time to get people from one place to another 70-100 miles away.

Im all for smaller scale rail lines though, like for cities. I live in London and although our public transport train system is one of the best it's always good to hear when they decide to expand even more.

402,psykiv,"I don't care about having high speed rail here in the United States. It is a solution to a problem we don't have.

I have been to countries where rail is the norm, and I enjoyed using it to get around. This only works in very densely packed cities where you are rarely more than a 10 minute walk from any station. This is to get around intracity.

When it comes to intercity, there are no advantageswhen compared to air travel. If you honestly think there won't be TSA style checkpoints, you are mistaken. They will nickle and dime you even more than airlines do (at least with airlines you have a choice: american, delta, united, etc). At best it will take the same amount of time between two cities.

 You still have the same problem when you arrive at your destination city. WHAT NOW? You either have to rent a car, take a taxi, arrange for transportation with someone, or hope you're within walking distance from a train station or bus stop (and even then, hope that one of those stops is walking distance from your final destination).

I think we should invest more money into our interstate highway systems and into self driving cars. I don't see a reason why in the future self driving cars can not do 150 mph safely on designated roads. No security checkpoints to worry about. No restrictions on how much you can take (other than the physical limits of the vehicle), and it's a true point to point solution, not a hub to hub like we have with airports or train stations. Refueling would not be a huge issue once we have superchargers everywhere and batteries that can be recharged using either solar power or special conductors on the road. All this could be paid for with tolls. 

Miami to NYC would take just over 8 hours. Let's compare it to a flight. Bare minimum of 30 minutes driving to the airport. Another hour checking in, going through tsa, finding your terminal, and boarding. 3 hour flight time. 30 minutes to get off the plane and to the taxi/subway station. another 30 minutes to actually get to your destination. Sure flying is still faster, but it's barely a 2.5 hour difference. Worth it to not have to deal with tsa, seats designed for anorexic five year olds, and you can leave exactly on your schedule (good for smaller cities where you are forced to stay an extra night simply because there is no combination of flights that would work with a normal schedule. its happened to me a few times.)

3. I can envisage almost a subscription car service. You sign up, an allocated car arrives, ferries you around, drops you off and drives off to the next customer. You may never actually have to own a car.

4. As more people go for the self-drive option (which they will mind you given the convenience) then commute times will become better. As self-driving cars begin to look at the wider picture, as in overall traffic flow for a state/ country, traffic jams will become rarer and journey efficiency will improve.

5. As more people adopt the number of traffic accidents will fall dramatically, which will put pressure on those who continue to choose to drive. This of course won’t happen on mass, but there will develop stigma against those who drive themselves as they will statistically cause most of the traffic accidents.

The reason seems to be to give people access to high-speed internet, not to make money *directly* from the subscriptions. Google also has a lot of other projects to provide internet access, for example through free long range wireless access points in poor countries. A connected world eventually means they can serve more ads, and Google has an extremely long-term vision when it comes to ads, they're continuously planning and anticipating their position in the market for the next 2-3 decades.

They aren't developing self driving cars to sell cars either, they are making them so you can be served contextual ads about what restaurant your car should drive to to serve you food, which would often be a restaurant that pays Google for that service.

TL;DR Fiber isn't their main business, it's just a pawn in their strategy game involving the advertisement market. If they could exclusively serve ads on their own Fiber, and Comcast would only support ""Comcast Approved Ads"" (and/or demanding a share of Google's ad revenue on their connection), Google would lose a lot of money.",1398785665,ch53ent,t1_ch4r8pl,technology,t5_2qh16,2014

My self driving ~~Canyonero~~ Chevrolet 3500 dual-axle truck is motoring along when you pull out in front of me in your SmartCar because you're driving in 'manual mode' and not 'AI'.

With a collision absolutely imminent, the computer makes a calculation that the best course of action is to put the accelerator to the floor and let physics make a speed bump out of that little clown car....

Same goes for motorcyclists, bicyclists, pedestrians, and those morons that think they can drive their motorized wheelchairs on the road as long as they have a little orange flag instead of sticking to the aisles at Walmart where they belong.  Why risk possible injury for the occupants by trying to brake when a much lower risk course of action exists?


We might not want to trust or empower the cars to make altruistic decisions with our lives, but we certainly can't empower them to try to preserve our lives without limits either.

The best drivers have about a .5 second reaction time, but even then, cannot be aware of everything going on around them.  Not only does the automated car have a near-instant reaction time, but it has a near-perfect map of everything going on around it.  Pedestrians would be accounted for as a potential liability, just as other vehicles are.  I am unaware of any scenario (at least in the US) in which pedestrians would be crossing a road where the speed limit is greater than 25-30, in which there is no prior indication of the need to stop/slow, *and* in which there would be no way of seeing the pedestrian about to move onto the road in time to slow down, stop, or swerve.  Outside the US or Europe, where traffic laws are often poorly followed if they even exist, is a somewhat different problem that I'm not sure anyone is actively trying to tackle yet.

The only way I see for this scenario to present itself is if someone intentionally tries to cause it by jumping in front of the vehicle.  Even then, it will have started to slow down before that person has even left the curb if it were determined to be impossible to avoid hitting the person (such as a large vehicle or wall being on the other side of it).",1400005171,chh0rdr,t1_chgslgd,technology,t5_2qh16,2014

You can view this topic from a rational or a more ideological side. Rationally, automation of transportation is very desirable, because human error still is the No 1 reason in traffic accidents. We're slow, we're not made to drive. From an idealistic perspective, you could argue against giving more 'power' to the machines / centralizing our life even more. But that will happen nonetheless.

The only rational argument I've heard against self-driving cars is that, since driving is cerebral stimulation,  it will dull down people even more. They work a repetitive job, are driven home passively, sit in front of their TV, sleep, rinse and repeat. But hey, that's what video games are for.

498,[deleted],"Again, you have no idea what you're talking about. Since you're so behind on your knowledge I encourage you to get some background on wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car.

You're right, technology doesn't just magically appear as a final product. In the case of the current S class, Mercedes had been developing the foundations for the technology in this car for literally decades. As I mentioned in my previous post, testing and perfecting things like laser cruise control and pre-collision systems was necessary before they got to the point of a semi-autonomous car. And a semi autonomous car is necessary to develop and learn from before the company will move to a fully autonomous car.

Every major car manufacturer is working to develop a fully autonomous vehicle and within the next 10 years all of them with offer self-driving cars in their lineup. It has nothing to do with Google and everything to do with the market. Whichever manufacturer produces a fully autonomous car first will be lauded and rewarded in the form of huge sales numbers. Even though the technology exists to put a self-driving car out now, automakers first need to prove the technology to the public in less drastic forms (i.e. a semi-autonomous vehicle) and lobby to change laws allowing self-driving cars on the road. They will also need to lobby for laws indemnifying them in cases where a self-driving car causes property damage or injures a person since paying out money for lawsuits would be unsustainable and make self-driving cars unprofitable. This will all happen over the next 10 years and again we will see many self-driving cars on the road in this time. 

Google is extremely late to the game and only has a small team working on their self-driving cars. More than anything it's a marketing stunt to convince people like you that they're an amazing company doing amazing things. At most they'll license a few patents off of what they've created or license the full technology to other sectors (farm equipment, watercraft, etc).

With no human driver required there is the potential that self-driving vehicles would virtually eliminate private car ownership. Companies would exist just to purchase fleets of vehicles, and those vehicles just go out to make money 24/7, only stopping to refuel or charge. 

Private cars sit unused the drastically-huge majority of the time. In a world with cheap and ubiquitous on-demand transport, why would a rational individual incur the expense of buying, maintaining and owning a vehicle? If I could walk outside anywhere, hit a button on a smartphone app then have a car in front of me within a short time and pay less than owning a car, it would be silly to own one. The big barrier to this is the meat driver having to get paid. If it is just a machine, costs can be minimized to the machine operation plus a small profit for the investor which will inevitably be less than private car ownership. 

The implications of this model are tremendous. There would be a drastic reduction in number of cars on the road, traffic would be eliminated, commute times would be slashed, fuel/energy would be saved by orders of magnitude. Families would be freed from one major financial expense and more people would have greater access to transport.

Self driving cars will be more about the ""sharing economy"" so less auto ownership.   Not completely but to some extent.   This means that people will be driving their car less.

31,Imaginos6,"The contract model as you have outlined is a likely near-term step that will develop naturally as the technology matures and attitudes shift whereas what I have suggested is a longer-term prospect that will develop out of that once the technology is flawless and the transport networks are robust enough.

My vision for it has 90% or more of the cars on the street as for-hire vehicles with dozens of companies competing to offer rides. Some company (maybe Uber) will provide the phone app and scheduling/demand/fare software. You walk outside, hit the button, and the software sorts out what cars are nearby and the companies bid to provide the cheapest service. Short time later your ride shows up and takes you where you want to go and a few bucks (or whatever the fare is... maybe cents for short rides) is deducted from your account. The car goes on from there to hunt other rides. No contracts, just pay as you go. 

It makes sense that both models will develop organically over time. 

At first, the technology will be just like a fancy cruise control for your new car. Neat, but it is still your own private car. A small time later once true self-driving happens and you can send the car somewhere autonomously, or request it to come get you, a family might downsize to one car. My car takes me to work then comes back home to drop the kids at school then drop off the wife at her job, then comes back to me to drive me on my lunch break, then back to the kids' school for the ride home and so on. Why have two cars when you can do that all with one? 

Next some groups will realize they can share cars in the same way and groups of families might get together to buy a car or two or three together. This is the contract model. People buy into collective carpools. They figure out how big the group is, how many cars they need to provide service and go that way. Nicer jobs might offer membership to a service as a incentive/perk. 

But people are always looking to make a buck and the taxi companies will be all over this at about the same time. It will start in urban settings where there are already robust taxi networks and plenty of fares to pick up. The taxi companies will LOVE to replace drivers. It won't happen overnight, because the investment will be huge, but automated cars will, one at a time, replace drivers. As they become more ubiquitous, the cities will reap the benefits as outlined in my prior post.  

Cost constraints and market factors will determine how quickly these networks will grow out from the cities to subsume the contract model. This model makes the least sense in highly rural areas, so, like most other things these will be the most costly areas to get service to, but as competition gets stiffer with the cab companies and costs come down, they will expand service farther and farther out from the cities in interest of gathering fares. As costs come down people are less willing to own their own cars or even belong to carpools. Thus the transition is complete.

Well, the first problem is that there are millions of cars already on the road *without* a speed governor, so even if you mandate it on all future vehicles, you're looking at 10 years jusy to get over the major statistical hump of *half the cars on the road*. From there it's a long slog to get to where non-limited cars become truly rare and not a threat... particularly when recidivist DUI folks are probably not buying new cars very often.

So now we're looking at 20 years or so of largely ineffective regulation that even when it's working only reduces drunkies to ""murderous"" speed down from ""slightly more murderous"", by which time self-driving cars will probably have addressed the issue more effectively.

39,Digitlnoize,"The economics of self-driving cars, by digitlnoize:

- 33,000 motor vehicle accident deaths per year.  9000 of these are kids, so 24,000 adult accident deaths.    
- median US income for all people &gt; 18 = $24000
- average tax rate in 2010: 11.81%
- tax revenue lost per year to accidents: 24k * 24k * .1181= $68 MILLION PER YEAR in lost income tax revenue (does not include sales tax, property tax, etc...so we are underestimating here)

Dead People Don't Pay Taxes or Have Kids:

- 9000 kids per year don't grow up to pay taxes because they die in car accidents.  That is a yearly tax revenue loss of: 9k * 24k * 0.1181=$25.5 Million/year
- Dead kids don't have kids.  So, that's another 25.5 Million/year lost for each kid they don't have.  

Total Yearly Cost:  68+25.5+25.5=119 million

- Note: this highly underestimates true yearly cost because it doesn't take into account adults who died childless who would've had kids otherwise. 

Except these costs are exponential:

- Year 1: $119 million lost
- Year 2: $238 million lost
- Year 3: $357 million lost
- Years 4-10: $476 M, 595M, 714M, 833M, 952M, 1.07B, 1.19B.   
- Total 10-year Cost: $6.54 Billion

How many lives would truly self-driving cars save?  50%?  90%?  I don't know.  I'd estimate that we won't trust them (thus widespread adoption won't happen) until they're well over 90% safe.  But for the sake of argument, let's say they only prevent 25% of accidents.  

Tax revenue saved by autonomous cars: $1.6B over 10 years.  

Now Think Generationally:

- Dead People Don't Have Kids or Pay Taxes
- Over 3 generations, the tax revenue saved is likely in the Trillions.  Over 10 generations, it's more than that.  From all the people who didn't die and now get to have kids.  Kids who get to grow up and pay taxes.  And have kids who pay taxes.  

- The Gov't could just ear mark a portion of this tax revenue (over 1-2 generations) to pay for a widespread autonomous car infrastructure program.  With generational tax revenue savings they could afford to retrofit every vehicle and road with a self-driving system.  
- This does not take into account the efficiency savings from having a police force that could focus on other crime, from decreased commute times, from decreased demand on rescue and healthcare systems.  
- This also doesn't take into account the MASSIVE savings from DISABILITY due to car accidents, which may even surpass the loss of tax revenue due to deaths, but would NOT have the multi-generational calculation benefits that calculating the death impact has.

These self-driving cars won't be cheap, and will be available to the middle class and up. Meanwhile, the lower class will continue to drive used manual cars, and pay insurance premiums because of it. Eventually, the government will start to regulate cars on the road, and impose a tax on those driving old school manual cars, taking more money out of the pockets of those who don't have it, and giving tax breaks to those who can already afford the new cars.

I think the argument could be made that self driving cars displace current human labor in a way that doesnt allow the unskilled workforce of drivers to easily pivot anywhere. First of all maintaining self driving cars requires a much different skill and education set. Technology directly replaces the human without opening up another unskilled labor market.

There may be places for the 11% of the population employed as drivers to suddenly do other things that don't require a lot of education and experience but I think it is unlikely.

I think the overall point here is that unskilled labor may become a thing of the past. If you do something that is at all repetitive or algorithmic, then your job will probably be replaced by a computer/robot sometime in the next 50 years.

On the other hand, people have been predicting the [permanent replacement of workers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite) by automation for a very long time now and have basically been 100% wrong.  

Sure, its different this time. Things like self driving cars could replace a lot more people a lot quicker than in other times, but thats just a guess. If self driving cars were to suddenly appear and work perfectly, it would be a very messy problem, but even then I suspect people would adjust and cope.  For that matter *there arent even any practicable self driving cars that currently that are practicle* and for all we know there might not be any for a long time still.  Cars have been able to drive themselves on roads since [VaMoRs in the 80s](http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/where-to-a-history-of-autonomous-vehicles/), but VaMors struggled with many of the same problems that prevent current self driving cars from being practicable.  Add on top of that Im sure will be many legal and financial complications that will slow down their adoption as well.

Thats not even bringing into the factor that generally the things that make the biggest changes are the ones that people arent thinking about.

The overall spectrum is huge, but pieces of it are set aside for different purposes.  Some are for radio and TV, some is for your wifi, some is for cell phones, some is for amateur radio, and the military, air traffic and so on. 

As far as 4k online, it appears that 50mb/s will do it for 4k video.  http://bgr.com/2013/09/26/netflix-4k-streaming/  

Remember Comcast and friends don't sell a guaranteed speed, they sell an ""up to"" whatever speed.  So their 50mb/s package might not be very reliable.  

Anyhow it seems to be almost nothing if you got a 1gb/s connection going to someone's house. 

I do think running a gigantic commercial operation, your own Google, would be frowned upon. 

Now I think it's reasonable to expect that data consumption is going to increase overall in the future, with this ""Internet of things"", smart power grid, self-driving cars and so on.  One thing about fiber optic lines is that the transmission rate is not limited so much by the line itself in the same way that DSL or your Coaxial is limited by the laws of physics, fiber optic is largely limited by the hardware talking to each other on each end. Where fiber optic lines are offered, my guess is it won't be long before you will see 10gb/s.

If there are more self driving cars on the road, and this results in fewer accidents, it is VERY reasonable to expect insurance rates to drop across the board.

Once a good percentage of vehicles are self driving, accidents will dramatically decline, commutes will be more efficient and manual drivers will increasingly impede the flow and safety of traffic on highways and in cities.

I also predict that most people will not own their own self-driving vehicles. Instead, they'll pay a monthly auto utility fee to have a fully-serviced vehicle provided for them for a select length of time. Time for your car to be serviced or replaced? Activate your car app and send it driving itself to a service center where it checks in and a shiny replacement vehicle drives itself back to your home.

132,bartturner,"Yes if there was a free alternative that had a better user experience then people would use it.   User experience meaning the entire package including ads and how ads are presented but also the value of the service.

Time will tell but I don't think that is going to happen.   I also think you will see other forms of monetization beyond ads.   It was reported that they paid out $7B in commissions from Play Store.   It has also been reported that they charge 30% commission.   So if these numbers are true then the Play Store had $10B in revenue.     

We don't know what this number includes.   How about the revenue from streaming ""The Interview""?    But my guess is that all content sales and app sales is getting to a decent size business and growing fast.   

Google Play Store is exactly three years old.   These numbers are not perfect but if they did go from 0 to $10B in three years well that is incredible. 

Smart phones, tablets, streaming TV, apps, etc are all so new.   We have IoT, wearables, etc.    Then robots, self driving cars, AI applications.   This has huge business opportunity but extremely immature in terms of how to monetize.   Many are trying to figure it out.  

When I look at Google I see a company that is better positioned than any other company.   IMO, they get it.   It is about data and using the data to constantly improve your product with as much automation as possible.   Which gets you more data which allows you to improve your product further and continues indefinitely.   

I also believe the raw material for this new world is software engineers which they appear to get.   Top of best place to work for 6 years is important, IMO.   Google has not only one visionary but two.   If something would happen to one of them then you have the other and, I believe, they still have Eric Schmidt.   They have a stock structure such that they can't be sidetracked from activist investors like Icahn.   They get to take the long view.   They get the new world is being built today therefore invest.   They get that providing a dividend indicates that you have run out of ideas.      

When I look at all of the assets that Google posses today I see a company that will be extremely successful for a long time.   The biggest wildcard will be Government intervention. 

On the privacy aspect.   There simply is not a perfect solution.   You provide your data to a company and they use that data to improve their product.   Google also uses that data to target ads.   This is acceptable for me.   But I also trust Google.   The bigger danger is people stealing the data and I believe Google has stronger engineering skills to protect the data.   Government, and specifically the US government, are also major concerns.   I also believe Google will do the best they can to protect data from the government.

In a transitional society somewhere in the near future (imagine 20% of the cars are self-driven) there would still be enough room for those same human idiot drivers to be causing all sorts of accidents on the road, only the onus will be on self-driving car manufacturers to prove that their vehicles didn't cause an accident.

I definitely feel like Tesla is pushing the bounds of what might be considered 'safe' autonomous driving at this point. And actually, I'm all for it. Something that pundits have said over and over again is that even though autonomous cars will likely be much safer than human drivers, adoption might be slow because people won't accept the same kinds of mistakes from a machine that they would from a human. If someone cuts me off and I slam in to them, no one thinks I'm at fault. But if my autonomous car hits them, the question of ""could the car have avoided it"" would probably come up.

207,redducational,"I know I'm late to the punch here, but I'd like to comment.
I think the solution for Tesla right now is to start offering insurance on their vehicles. It's already been proven that a computer operated system with 360 degree monitoring can assess a situation and brake/take evasive action faster than at least the  average human driver. So if Tesla were to offer an insurance plan with their vehicles comparable in price to the mainstream insurance providers, they could negate the negative effect of customer uncertainty on liability grounds. This would put them in a situation where they are insuring a liability that is statistically less than the typical insurance company, which covers error-prone humans. In addition to likely generating a net profit for Tesla, this would allow for a unified front from which Tesla could present their defense of the safety of automated vehicles. A primary argument of those who say the world is unready for self-driving cars is that a person, or worse, a
child be killed by an automated vehicle in error. But if Tesla were so sure, as I hope they should be, they would gladly assume that risk with the understanding that should an adverse event occur, they would have statistical evidence supporting the fact that despite that event, the introduction of their vehicle reduced the total number of injuries/fatalities in comparison with drivers utilizing other vehicles. While I am often proven wrong, I believe that the current population would understand that human or not, a decrease in the overall likelihood of an accident is an improvement. While it might take a few substantial court cases, I believe there is no corporation or individual with the ingenuity, momentum and capital as Tesla and Elon Musk to pioneer the self-driving car, at least at this point in time. By establishing insurance, Tesla could provide peace of mind and customer confidence, the ability to enjoy advanced convenience features liability free. In exchange, they would gain increased marketability of their vehicles, revenue from statistically advantageous insurance sales, and most importantly the opportunity to legally pioneer the self-driving car, further establishing Tesla as the true future of the automobile.
I hope the tech is ready, I really do. If Tesla does this with the right timing it could jump society into a safer, faster, more economical way of commuting. If not, we might get boggled up in decades of controversy if public opinion goes in the way of technophobia. 

Tl;dr
If Tesla truly believes in the safety of their vehicles, they should offer insurance assuming liability. Then they could establish legal and popular support for the introduction of autonomous vehicles. Assuming the cars are safe, vehicular travel
becomes safer, faster and more efficient, plus Tesla makes lots of money.

208,moofunk,"I think it comes best from Steve Jurvetson, who heavily invested in Tesla, board member and owns the first Model S that came off the assembly line:

He doesn't want his kids ever to need to drive a car.

Think about who their competitors are in self driving cars: It's not Mercedes or BMW. It's Google. Neither Google nor Tesla have had a big fleet of cars on the road, so they can start afresh with new technology, where the other guys have spent close to 20 years to get to where they are now. Neither Google nor Tesla has spent more than 2-3 years to get to the same point.

Tesla has the means to make such a car possible, because they are much more heavily invested in software than we think. They are more like Google, but with a car company face, and that is misleading.

There is so much software in and around the Model S, particularly for battery control and charging, which is one reason why their batteries are better than anyone else's, why they can do so many changes via software updates, and why they can set up such a tightly monitored super charging network.

Self-driving is approached as an IT problem, so they can grab all the talent they want from Silicon Valley and get the leading edge developers in machine learning, image recognition technology and even from the gaming industry, where there's already lots of similar software.

The other car manufacturers don't do that. Their IT competence has grown out of what was inside the traditional car industry, which is why Tesla are so far ahead of them in some areas, and currently a little bit behind in others, because they simply haven't been around long enough.

So, Tesla builds computers on wheels. The other guys builds cars with computers in them. If you know what I mean.

The same questions come up with SpaceX: How can you be sure they will deliver? Well, they do and continue to do that, because they have a different and crazy rapid development process, and they are also heavily relying on software that we don't hear much about, because it's part of their secret sauce.

There are other reasons as well, but they descend more and more into paranoia. Instead, let's look at the California 'smart gun' fiasco. The way this comes about is:

1. somebody proposes a technology in the name of 'safety'
2. an idiotic lawmaker thinks it's so great that everybody needs to use it *NOW!* and passes a preemptive law that if the technology exists, it is now mandatory for all products.
3. the original person finally goes to the hard work and makes a product that has limitations but is overall okay for those that really want it.
4. the law defaults into action, all newly produced products without the feature are now contraband.
5. owners of the existing products, furious at the government, blockade the store to prevent a single of the 'new, safer' product from being sold.
6. product pulled from market as unsellable, despite functioning well enough.
7. all new product is now illegal, users must import from out of state by way of loopholes.

215,moofunk,"&gt; Well, the difference of opinion here seems to be that I don't really put that much value in ""Silicon Valley"" and ""doing it differently from other companies"". I.e. I don't see how that is a factor in how well a company is able to do r&amp;d.

It's a big, big, *big* factor to have a concentrated place, where many different companies and people can come together and exchange ideas, which is what that place is really, really good at.

We don't get all the sweet stuff we have from that place, because it's a lovely place in sunny California, or because the wages are high.

It's because you have the opportunity to let people who are good at algorithms to talk to neurologists or biologists, who are interested in IT.
Only after they get together and are inspired, *then* the research and development goes into action. Suddenly you have new image recognition technologies that are built on a deeper understanding of how it works in nature.

Random meetings happened between people who knew about each part of simulation, manufacturing and rocket engines and what they dreamed about doing, and now SpaceX are mass producing one of the most efficient and reliable rocket engines, the Merlin 1D.

You don't have much of that in the old car industry, where it's all closed off trench warfare and who the engineers get to meet is decided by the Human Resources department and communicating with competitors happens via lawyers and patents.

They hire engineers with specific qualifications from universities and let them boil in a lab for 10 years until they figure out how to make a car recognize road lines with a camera. They didn't think to hire a biologist or to let the engineers be inspired by nature.

Or maybe ask an artist how he conveys imagery to people to make them think twice about how they should do a user interface for the touch screen in their next car.

The get-togethers between companies are for the upper brass, lawyers and salesmen, who are figuring out how to make more money.

This is observable by how crazy the decisions some of these large companies make. Toyota decided to build hydrogen cars. I really doubt that was a decision that was made by someone in the company, who really knew the ins and outs of creating machines that use hydrogen. That was 100% a business decision between people, who have no clue.

The same happens in the Japanese bipedal robot industry handled by the old big companies like Honda. They are moving much slower than I expected and hoped, and I think that is because they do not take cues from biology to build a better biped robot. The next revolution in biped robotics will absolutely not come from there, but small startups that we don't yet know the names of.

I mentioned Mr. Jurvetson's quip before about his kids not needing to drive their own cars. He emphasized that Sillicon Valley is a place where ""ideas go to have sex"", as he humorously puts it.

The result of this is an ""acceleration of ideas"" as each new idea is more powerful than the previous one. This stuff doesn't happen without random meetings between many different kinds of people, and Tesla could not do what they do without these ideas. But these were idea exchanges that happened in private, so we don't hear much about them yet.

On tarmac roads where the contrast between the lines and road is good the system works well, but across the Midwest we have a lot of light-coloured concrete roads with white lines.

264,BuhlmannStraub,"I work in Canada so I can only speak as so how things might end up working here. 

In the current Canadian market, insurance is extremely regulated (except for Quebec). For example every time you change your rates you need to justify every single thing and your profit provision is limited. If you decide to lie, for example you say that your losses are actually higher than they are in order to justify higher rates they will audit you and ruin you. (Other than regulation there are many other reasons why you would not want to do that). So because of this collusion wouldn't work so just getting that out of the way.

As for the rates, there are flat portions of the rates which are related to expenses so no matter how much of a non risk you are, you will be charged those. The rest of the rate has to do with your level of risk and these will drop and they will drop a lot. From a purely actuarial standpoint this is fine because you are still covering your losses and your profit provision will remain the same. Only the portion of the insurance that is related to your losses will drop. So from this point of view your profit is actually not touched at all. However where your profit is touched is investment income because most of the companies insurance income comes from just holding on to your money before paying for losses. However this will be offset in one major way: underwriting. Unlike most businesses, in the insurance business, just because you sell a lot doesn't mean that you are doing well in fact you could really ruin yourself which is why you have underwriting rules. However with self driving cars you can write way more insurance, you can allow for a massive spike in your volume and this is where the profit will re-balance. On average you will re-balance to make the same profit but with much lower volatility.

Now with that said, like all businesses some insurance companies will get demolished in this environment. But all in all it will make actuaries around the world very happy.

Edit: I guess I can add a TL;DR since it's a lot of bla bla

**TL;DR:** Premiums will drop, Underwriting profit will not change and investment income will instead be replaced by an increase in volume due to higher capacity",1427049645,cpn59l1,t1_cpn4qfd,technology,t5_2qh16,2015

There's two billion of them. The total number of cars and trucks on the road is two billion and climbing... The capacity of car/truck production is about 100 million a year.

&gt;So if tomorrow all cars were autonomous, it would take 20 years to replace the fleet, assuming the fleet stayed the same size. Arguably it could get smaller if things were autonomous, but still it's maybe 15 years or something and it's not all going to transition immediately. It's going to take quite a while. And it's the same for electrification of cars. Changing that industrial base to be electric — if all cars tomorrow produced were electric, it would still take 20 years to replace the fleet.

It might live on as a niche hobby, on private tracks and away from public roads, but that's all it will be.

319,Vik1ng,"If you follow the citation you will actually get [this](http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/U.S.+Department+of+Transportation+Releases+Policy+on+Automated+Vehicle+Development):

&gt; * No-Automation (Level 0): The driver is in complete and sole control of the primary vehicle controls – brake, steering, throttle, and motive power – at all times.

&gt; * Function-specific Automation (Level 1): Automation at this level involves one or more specific control functions. Examples include electronic stability control or pre-charged brakes, where the vehicle automatically assists with braking to enable the driver to regain control of the vehicle or stop faster than possible by acting alone.

&gt; * Combined Function Automation (Level 2): This level involves automation of at least two primary control functions designed to work in unison to relieve the driver of control of those functions. **An example of combined functions enabling a Level 2 system is adaptive cruise control in combination with lane centering.**

&gt; * Limited **Self-Driving** Automation (Level 3): Vehicles at this level of automation enable the driver to cede full control of all safety-critical functions under certain traffic or environmental conditions and in those conditions to rely heavily on the vehicle to monitor for changes in those conditions requiring transition back to driver control. The driver is expected to be available for occasional control, but with sufficiently comfortable transition time. The Google car is an example of limited self-driving automation.

&gt; * Full **Self-Driving** Automation (Level 4): The vehicle is designed to perform all safety-critical driving functions and monitor roadway conditions for an entire trip. Such a design anticipates that the driver will provide destination or navigation input, but is not expected to be available for control at any time during the trip. This includes both occupied and unoccupied vehicles. 

So to me that looks that they see it just like the top comment: ""*so just cruise control and highway lanes. this is nothing like self-driving.""*

Prohibition has taught us that you cannot simply enforce the illegality of an activity consumed by several millions of people (try banning cigarettes first and see what will happen).

Governments would not be foolish enough to ban the driving of non-assisted vehicles outright, not to mention the automotive companies that would lobby against such a policy.

What I think would likely happen, is that regular cars would be taxed as a deterrent mechanism to try and move people away on to more safer alternatives.

From a marketing position, the challenge would have to be to offer assisted self-driving cars that are so futuristic and unlike anything we have on the market, we would see consumer demand exponentially increase; a faster adoption rate than in the 1950s with General Motors. 

Then *you would* see a decline over time.

This seems like a similar problem to the train track dilemma, or what wikipedia calls the trolley problem. There are an awful lot of people that would make the consious decision to live with more risk if that meant that they had more control. They are not comfortable with risk, even if that risk is greatly reduced, if they have less control.

You would have to reduce the risk to an infinitesimal level, demonstrate the benefits, and then maybe most people would be OK with letting Google take the wheel. Even then, good luck with this shit in America. It will never happen.

This is where your other points come in. Vehicle ownership is strongly tied to independence and freedom of movement. Forget unauthorized government control. Police are going to hate automated vehicles because DUI and other offenses are how they get their RAS and PC to conduct a stop.

i'd say it should be manufacturer responsibility if the car causes an accident and it is the fault of the company itself (ie their algorithm fails). but if someone purposely refuses to use the car's self driving feature, why should the manufacturer be responsible for the human error? similarly, if the self driving car is going about its business and someone runs a redlight in a manually driven car, one could make the argument that a manually driven car might not have continued driving into the intersection.

its more than just following road laws, its accounting for the unaccountable and accidental.

i think what we'll probably start with is a car that self drives on the highway only. IE it will maintain a safe following distance with the car in front, it will stay in one lane, and it will follow highway directions until a mile or two before the intersection. and then it will trigger alarms for the driver to take control before the driver's exit, or it will safely move to the shoulder, put on its hazards, and power down until the driver interacts again (ie if the driver went to sleep while the car did its thing).

On the other hand, so far self-driving car tests have been very controlled tests, but really the worst that would happen is one crash. I'm not saying that that's not dangerous, but it's not nearly as dangerous as a nuclear reactor going Chernobyl on us. 

One self-driving car crashing, and that company is going to stop running any other cars that may be affected until they fix the issue and double down on their safety testing before starting back up again.

Also, with nuclear testing, if a reactor blows, every around is screwed, and maybe the company that was testing it goes under. Or maybe it's the government testing it, and they keep testing, because they can.

But with cars, once a company has an at-fault crash, it's going to be major headline news, and that company will instantly be the least-trusted company in self-driving cars. 

So while every manufacturer is (or at least, should be) putting in every effort to get a self-driving car into commercial production, they're also taking every precaution necessary to prevent themselves from being labeled as the company that doesn't care about passenger safety, because they know that every incident, no matter how minor, affects the perception of their company, and therefore, their sales.",1427082270,cpnmnru,t1_cpnl5kc,technology,t5_2qh16,2015

1. Charging people who have accidents now with vehicular assault is stupid. It isn't likely to change in the future when there are a mix of self driving cars and normal cars. Unless of course everyone starts huffing paint and running down ~~midgets~~ people and having the most deliberate accidents, the law regarding that should stay the same. Accidents are still going to happen anyway, even with the newest technology in self driving cars (faulty maintenance, extreme weather conditions, software glitches, hardware failure etc).

2. Regular cars shouldn't have any problems navigating the roads of the future. You can still physically ride a fucking chariot on the road if you wanted. The road surface is not likely to change much in physical properties/design, the only real change is less parking in urban areas(You can send your car  home and tell it to pick you up  at the door after work). Sure you can have higher speed limits on straight sections of road if everyone were to have self driving vehicles, but the corners and curves would still bottleneck the entire road as not all vehicles can corner quickly. Also the thought of having higher speed limits in urban areas would terrify me as a cyclist/pedestrian as having cars race past me on the sidewalk/road terrify me. 

3. I really don't see how my insurance rate would increase even with the influx of self driving cars. Sure they are statistically less likely to have accidents and they will probably be cheaper to insure, but how will that drive up my insurance rate?

Does surrounding yourself with obese people make you lighter? Not sure what backrupting is, but nothing has happened to me thinking about my insurance rate.

The technology is developing fast. Many cars already drive themselves a little - stuff like lane keeping and smart cruise control with radar. It won't be more than a couple of years until we see the first fully-automatic-capable model, and most new cars will have that capability within 5 years. This is my prediction if *nothing* is legislated requiring self-driving capability.

So let's take that 5-year-to-ubiquity-in-new-cars number plus our oldest-car-you-know and that puts us at about 30 years until basically all cars on the road are capable of driving themselves, with *no* new market forces in play.

**But wait, there's more!**

Most of the oldest cars (again, excluding enthusiast ""classic"" models) on the road are driven by the poorest people. A self-driving taxi service would be incredibly cheap, with a per-mile cost that is probably *lower* than owning your own car. (The SDTaxi must drive out to pick you up which puts more mileage on it, but a car you own spends 23 hours a day sitting idle, depreciating in value all the time, while a SDTaxi can be driving people around constantly, effectively dividing this 'depreciation' cost by 10 or 20. Plus, lower insurance.) So what does that mean? Instead of keeping around your old, human-driven beater, it would make a lot more financial sense to get taxi'd around. I would say anyone with a car more than about 10 years old would find such an arrangement - ordering a taxi that doesn't cost what a taxi costs - to be an appealing proposition.

So that gives me my estimate of about 15 years until outlawing human-driven cars starts being normal. It won't happen all at once - probably in cities first, then suburbs, and much later, country roads. I think we'll see the *first* SDC-only jurisdiction a few years before that, but that's about when the idea will pick up steam.

If you want to say 50 years before *everywhere* is SDC-only, sure. Those country roads are going to allow humans for a long time, no doubt. But for most of the most populated areas, 20 years is *generous*.",1427088811,cpnpa68,t1_cpnau48,technology,t5_2qh16,2015

If only some people have self driving cars we lose all the benefits except for somewhat improved safety. If every car is self driving, and only then, it completely changes the way driving would work. You'd have nothing but flawless merging on the freeways, and no traffic jams, you'd have intersections where you don't even need to stop because the cars can just weave around each other safely, and then you get all the other benefits I listed as well. You can only do that if everyone has one though, there's no way humans could safely drive with self driving cars in that scenario, regardless of how good of a driver you might be. 

The other scenario which you suggest where only some people have them would improve safety overall, and but we're stuck with the same mess that we have now. I do believe that this will happen in stages though and that will be the first stage, which will likely last for a long time. Initially it will be a luxury only the rich can afford, then eventually it will reach the middle and lower classes with affordable models, then someday it will probably be mandated that all new cars have self driving features installed, then sometime down the line (probably like 30-50 years IMO), it will make sense to require self driving cars. Sadly I probably won't get to enjoy it much by the time it happens.

I would think eventually driving will be treated in a similar manner to horse back riding today. There would probably be large courses setup in the outskirts of town where you could house your car, much like you would a horse.

Not in the way the rumors are pointing at.  Apple has had a penchant for making anything cool, from a computer(that was a tough sell in the 80's), to digital music players, etc.  But I don't think there's anyone on the entire planet that could make a *van* cool.  I always pictured an Apple Car basically exactly like a Tesla, but even sexier.  

Apple is trying to dip it's toes back into luxury, but their hitting market they've never been in before.  I don't think buying a luxury car is like buying a luxury smart phone, otherwise, more people would be buying a Tesla.  People have always been willing to shell out a few hundred dollars for better design or smoother software, or even gimmicky features.  But no one in their right mind would pay *thousands* for that, unless there is some killer app or feature we're totally in the dark about.  That feature on Apple Watch was *supposed* to be heart attack detection, which would have literally changed the world.  Apparently, besides the legal minefield they'd be stepping into, they couldn't get it accurate enough, same problem that Nintendo had with the Wii vitality meter.

You may have heard of one such as Bitcoin, which introduced blockchain to the world, solving an old computer science problem of double spending. There are more sophisticated cryptocurrencies in development, one of which is called Ethereum. What separates ETH from BTC is that it is Turing complete. This means that ppl running the ETH blockchain can also run computer code like a virtual computer.

On Ethereum we can run decentralized applications or DApp. They are open source pieces of code that require fuel (ETH) to function. A common example is to create a decentralized Facebook where our data is not focalized to one Inc, but you can also create a network of vehicles that charge a fee and is ""rented"" to you like Zipcar. With self driving cars, we can foresee a DApp Uber or Lyft. Although taxi service could be decentralized immediately with human drivers, it's more comforting to call a driver whose background had been checked by a corporation.

29,ima747r,"Very interesting parallels. Obviously no one can say what the future holds but it's entirely plausible that, in spite of their continued growth, Apples golden age is over and they're just in a juggernaut phase now which will eventually peak and reverse direction. That wouldn't surprise me in the least. But it's far from guaranteed. Two key differences I see that could drastically change that:

Apple has actually been making a lot of long term bets on development. The short side of this is that they look pretty stagnant in both hardware (yearly iterations, and entirely predictable new products that are purely market demand reactions, absolutely nothing ""new""), and software (iterative improvements on all platforms). However behind the scenes they have been making HUGE bets on future technologies (all the stuff related to cars we are only hearing whispers of the first drafts of the concepts, Siri is crap, but it's handled as a core technology with low level integration across all platforms, etc). They're not playing the hand they have, they're playing the hand they hope to have in 5 years (when self driving cars are viable, when speech recognition is practical and not just a gimmick, etc). That is of course all a bet... If it doesn't pan out they're not getting ahead of anyone, but they have the resources to try, high ver few others do.

VR is widely agreed to be the next world changing tech, and it's right around the corner (less than a month) from hitting 1.0 for consumers. The general consensus is that the future of vr will be built on mobile type hardware. Apples dominance with the iPhone shows they know a few things about getting it made and getting it sold. No one knows if they can get it designed and working of course, but again, they have resources few others have. They also have a history of letting others make the early mistakes, and then come in later with the genre defining product (see GUI, MP3 players, smart phones, tablets, ultra portable laptops, etc.). They probably won't release anything for a number of years, but when they do it will likely be designed around other companies mistakes, with the aim of taking over the public perception of what VR means. And they will produce it in volume, and at a ""premium"". But not too expensive price point.

Microsoft is trying some related moves, but they're held back by corporate structure, bulk, and a lack of direction. Things like holo lense sound amazing but in the light of day are really just engineering experiments (too expensive, not practical due to technical limitations, and no clear way to improve either problem in the short or medium term). Windows 10, with its associated metric gathering tools and aggressive push to grow user base by rapidly phasing out older OS versions is a pretty blatant attempt to gather Facebook/Google types of raw data for value, and App Store like controlled revenue and distribution streams. If it works they're in a pretty sweet position, but both of those goals are directly offensive to their typical true source of income, which is enterprise and government. Consumers are small potatoes when you can sell bulk licenses. And those bulk buyers specifically can't afford to let the metrics out (security) and can't afford to the the App Store directly (IT nightmares and costs, side note: Apple has a totally separate app distribution system for enterprise customers for iOS specifically to address this type of thing). Time will tell if they can live out their new Machiavellian dreams of total comouter domination, or if they finally shot themselves in the foot one too many times, and opened the door for Linux or some other new player in the enterprise, etc. space.

So just some thoughts. Also keep in mind we love in the future, and the world changes quick.  Facebook dominates so many things now and just a few years ago they didn't even really exist... As hard as it is to imagine Microsoft, or Apple, Bing replaced, it could happen Ina just a few years from a player we've never even heard of yet.",1457836320,d0xsyuu,t3_4a62yn,technology,t5_2qh16,2016

You're worried about nothing. Apple is doing what it has always done - enter a market late but with the best executed product.

For the record, Tesla is *easy* to leapfrog. Tesla is not doing anything that every other car company in the world can't do at the drop of a hat should they prove the market is large enough to warrant it. Heck, people build electric cars out of old VW Beetles all the time.

Self driving technology will only accelerate that timeline. Cars that allow human drivers will become increasingly expensive to insure as self driving cars become available, and maintenance costs for conventional cars will do nothing but rise (eating into the stagnant resources that is the average household income). Since most cars spend roughly 95% percent of their time quietly depreciating in value while just as quietly costing money to own, more and more households will discover the joy of cutting THAT cable.

35,magicsonar,"&gt; So is Google. And Microsoft. And Amazon. What's your point? Why single Apple out here?

Because Apple was the world's biggest retailer of digital music and that market is now shrinking dramatically. 

&gt;For that matter, what exactly do you think Google offers in the on-demand streaming space that Apple does not?

YouTube is the world's biggest video streaming service by a large margin.

&gt; I can't buy a Google Car. I can't buy an Apple Car. How is Apple playing catch-up to Google?

Because Google has 1 million miles of real world road testing of self driving cars. And the world's most detailed mapping system. Would you get in a car tomorrow that was guided by Apple Maps?

&gt; Apple started the QuickTime VR project 22 years ago. Has Google been playing catch-up to this point? Have they caught-up with Google Cardboard? Who's judging this contest? For that matter, Facebook bought Occulus... does that really count as being ahead of the game?

Strategic acquisitions are definitely part of the landscape. It's a key way that big tech companies stay ahead of the game. So yes, if Facebook acquires the world leader in VR, then yes, it is ahead of the game. Both Google and Facebook have products right now. We don't know what Apple has. Maybe they have something mind-blowing, who knows.

&gt; Google bought DeepMind for $500 million dollars 2 years ago. By your logic, if Apple went and bought an AI firm tomorrow (with their $200+ billion in cash) they would be caught up? Is that meaningful?

Of course it's meaningful. But how many world class AI companies are there at the level of DeepMind? Google purchased Android at the right time. Would you consider Android meaningful to Google's position in mobile? Just because you have the money to make acquisitions means nothing. Unless you buy the right companies at the right time and do something with them. Just look at Microsoft.

At some point, you have to stop arguing that ""people should just be careful"" (that's how we got AIDS epidemics) and start addressing the problem.

&gt; And guess what, this self driving car caused an accident.

Yup. If self-driving cars can be ""just as good"" as humans, it will totally change the world. Your grand kids will drive themselves to the store whenever they want. New York City won't need 99% of the cars or parking it has now. When you purchase something online, it will show up at your door an hour later.

But it's unlikely that computers will stop at ""just as good"" as humans. After all, even when paying attention, humans have 100's of miliseconds of delays that computers just don't have.  And humans physically can't pay attention for hours at at time (while believing they can). We are in the ENIAC era of self-driving cars. They are big, clunkly, and can barely get anything done. But the technology will get better.

In ~100 years, it will be illegal to drive today's cars (just like it's illegal to take a horse on the highway, or illegal to drive an older car without modern safety equipment). You would have to be a stunt man with special insurance to even attempt it.

&gt; What happens when there are 5000 on the roads?

Actually it will be way safer. Computers can share data, and all brake at the same time.  It's the humans that cause accidents.

Again though, what they offer has more intentionally de-empowering aspects as part of the design philosophy of their products and that's my point.

As closed as most Androids are it's design is more empowering: you can stick to the official appstore or check that scary looking box to allow other repositories/apps if the main app store doesn't suit your needs. 

If apple included something of that nature I could have agreed with you, even if they hide it under some konami code type shit with scary ""abandon all hope ye who enter here"" message when asking confirmation that you really want to allow third party apps


&gt;But you do have to use the roads, usually.

Usually you're sticking to the roads because of physical limitations or someone's life or property would be in danger. 

 Not because some nanny motorvehicle corp decides that you can't go there because they find the content of that location unacceptable.

- The first step is the pure physics of motion,

- then the perception - the ability to observe what is happening sufficiently - this is mostly done,

- then the gradually increasing accommodation of the many hard-to-predict physical constraints like the distance required for one's own, or another vehicle, to stop given conditions of the road etc.,

- then the socially-predictive - predicting what other drivers are likely to do and should do

- then determining what the 'correct' activity is based on social expectation. 

 The last two items are going to be developed over probably 20-25 years, during which time the transition from purely-human to purely-self driven cars will occur.  Many of these factors can only be learned by experience, as there is no reasonable pre-determined algorithmic answer - judgement calls, if you will.  Each of us has gradually learned these things.  We now use body language of the other cars and drivers as clues to what is about to happen, and maintain a moral/ethical expectation of other drivers' activities.

I expect that during this transitional period, self-driving cars will be both restricted and encouraged by the availability of special lanes - probably the present car-pool lanes - where they are allowed to take full control, while on regular streets the AI will be limited to preventing driver error for some time.

Julie Zhuo, Product Design VP at Facebook

This is pretty subjective, but here's some stuff I'm excited about this year:

**VR:** the more I learn and experience it, the more I am excited about how new this Medium actually is in reaching a level of immersion not yet seen before. So far watching videos on Oculus is my favorite because I get to more closely experience things like surfing a colossal wave that I'd not get a chance to do. Some of the exploratory new UIs we're seeing in games like Lands' End (controlling things with the power of your gaze!) are also very intriguing to me. Looking forward to a lot more innovations in how we connect and interact with friends in this space.
    
**Voice UIs:** got an Amazon Echo recently and I love it. Theoretically the idea of asking questions/issuing commands by saying them (rather than typing them/manipulating a UI by hand) is so much more efficient, but voice technology has in the past never been good enough to actually be reliable enough to use regularly. The Echo is a sign to me that that is shifting. I hope to see more data-connected Voice UIs pop up everywhere in the future. 
    
**Live Broadcasting:** another very cool new medium that feels really engaging to me because of the fact that it is live and unpredictable, and because of the opportunities for real-time, deep and engaging interactions between the broadcasters and watchers. I have been watching so much Live on Facebook in past months.
    
**Productivity tools at work:** Slack is super cool and the nice touches and integrations are well done. I use Facebook@Work 8 hours a day (the enterprise version of Facebook where all the correspondences that would traditionally have been a mailing list or long subject line are now groups). As a designer, I love that there is so much innovation on design tools. We've been investing in a lot of stuff in-house at Facebook as well on the design tools front to help designers spend more time in the creative zone and less time on the manual, repetitive stuff.
    
**3-D printers and robots:** not necessary ""internet,"" and maybe 2016 isn't quite the year these become mainstream, but I think these are the jam. This is like productivity tools at work taken to the next level, where more and more things can physically be manufactured cheaply and quickly, and more and more time and energy can be poured into the creation of blueprints/patterns.  
    
**Self-driving cars.** Just got a Tesla this year. Obsessed with the auto-driving capability.

178,ItsMeCaptainMurphy,"My source is the technology package included in the ILX does everything he demonstrated out of the box. It's not the digital interface that's necessary, it's the fact that an ILX, from the manufacturer, can already drive itself along a highway, modify its following distance, and bring itself to a complete stop if there's a car that stops in front of it, all without any driver input. It comes with cameras and radar installed from the factory. He showed, at least in the articles I read about this, absolutely nothing new in terms of self-driving capabilities. As far as I can tell he was just tapping into the sensors/programs the car was already running and displaying the output on this laptop. He likely disabled the alarm the car raises if you keep your hands off the steering wheel for too long. In the video I saw from one website he even had the driver enable ""his"" systems by hitting the exact same button on the steering wheel that you use to turn on Acura's self-driving systems.

Certainly, there are particular tricks to it and I'm sure we can manage to use machine learning to 'teach' these techniques to more advanced self-driving AI in the future and surpass what human input can do, but I don't foresee that happening for a long time.

This technology is still sort of in its infancy. Right now it's far from foolproof, and we can't even trust it particularly well in fairly common conditions like fog and snow. Even then, the automation basically just acts as an extension of cruise control, keeping you centered in the lane, moving at a consistent speed, and avoiding collisions.

If I were a truck driver I'd be more excited than afraid. This technology is likely going to make our highways much safer, and while we can automate the easy part of driving, there is far too much involved in the process to remove humans from the equation entirely.

Humans have lapses. By waiting for a traffic gap or waiting to see incoming traffic slow to allow our actions we work with multiple factor safety.

You're fine. It's the people that work for UPS and similar companies running interstate routes that need to worry.

[EDIT] Look up the 80/20 rule of engineering. Paved, mapped roads are the 80%. Everything else is the 20%. solving that last 20 will take orders of magnitude longer than the 80. The way this will go is that slowly machines will become more and more automated, ""augmenting"" the operator. This will happen on the order of 5-10 year intervals. Eventually, the operator will be removed, but only in the safest, most controlled environments like interstates or specifically constructed urban routes (think bus lanes). Eventually, maybe, all paved/mapped routes will support full automation. Off road we might see small strides in places like the logging business or similar activities where the are operators doing other things near by or perhaps as part of a larger industrial system. The very last item to solve is the situation where a vehicle is just told ""go here"" and it figures everything out like off road paths and such. There's just so much to consider, it's legally risky, and the situation is so dynamic that it's going to be really hard to solve.

First off speech recognition is currently as good as it needs to be. My cellphone understands me just fine when I ask for directions to xyz while I'm driving with my windows down. Text to speech works well in most situations. I regularly use a translation app with my Polish in laws capturing spoken polish which is translated and read to me in English. It slows down because the demand for it to be better slowed down. No doubt there are millions of R&amp;D dollars out there for it still. But that's small potatoes. 


Snow is a killer of automation currently, agreed. Companies such as Google and Tesla began the pioneering into self driving vehicles and I won't call it short sighted that they didn't account for snow, more of a lack of data based on where they're headquartered and the conditions made available to them. Now that Ford, FCA and GM have thrown their hats in the ring commited to automation they're already making breakthroughs on these limitations. Ford is already testing a new method in conjunction with University of Michigan that has been showing good results in snow. 


Google is currently testing essentially windshield wipers on their sensors that increase visibility in rain dramatically. Again, California was in a massive drought for the past few years. Now that's over and the cars are learning a ton about driving in these conditions.   Yeah it'll take time. But only a few more years as each generation is improving exponentially. 


Why does security for a truck change at all?  The vehicle remains locked. There are cameras that can serve to identify would be thieves same as a truck driver would. Contrary to what Fast and Furious taught us drivers aren't packing heat. If someone wanted to rob the truck they would do it even with a human present and any smart human would let it happen. Why risk your life for material things, especially when they aren't even yours?  The moment someone presents a threat to the truck it can sound an alarm and send an alert to local police. That's more than you can guarantee a frightened driver at gun point could accomplish. 


I'll give you the things like traffic being redirected because I haven't read anything on that to date. But with companies worldwide now pouring literally billions into R&amp;D on this I have no doubt it will be overcome sooner rather than later.  I know right now the current generation recognizes street signs (easy enough as they are standardized for ease of human understanding) and follows the rules appropriately. I imagine a car linked to GPS and traffic reports could navigate any detour.

229,happyscrappy,"&gt; Indeed I missed those features, although they do not seam to be able to switch lanes and/or drive alone in the city (which even if not recommended Tesla users do).

The Audi at least switches lanes by simply pulling the wheel enough to tell it you want to switch lanes. This signals you want it to move over and it does so and then remains in the next lane over. Audi did it this way because they require you keep your hands on the wheel anyway (the have a sensor), so this was a logical way to do it. Tesla's way is eminently more logical if you are letting people take their hands off the wheel.

As to driving in the city, it works as well as it does on a Tesla. That is to say as long as you are following a relatively straight road or have a car in front for it to follow, it will work. If you come to an intersection, it'll usually be able to drive through it despite no lane markers by following the car in front. It can't make the turn.

They work the same as the Tesla or better, except for not having a large corpus of highway data as Tesla is building. Tesla is way in front on that. While the German car companies were fighting to buy Nokia's maps division to get maps data, Tesla is building their own maps data up in a much more detailed fashion and without the big up-front acquisition cost.

Let me give an example. I'm driving along in the Tesla in the right hand lane (in my country we drive on the right, so this is the slow lane) and the car just tries to drive right off the highway for more than a second. I, for reasons I can't explain, don't sufficiently panic and pull the wheel back even though it's trying to drive into the grass. It eventually catches on and pulls back onto the road.

So what happened? Well, I was in the slow lane, and the right hand lane line veered off to the right because there was an exit ramp (the road was curving gently left). The car started to follow the line and eventually caught on that it messed up and pulled back into the lane to continue on the highway. Then it reports back to Tesla that that happened in this place (going this direction). And after that happens to a few people, Tesla incorporates it into their database and the car knows not veer off onto that exit if you're in the right hand lane (it already didn't do it in other lanes, as those lane markers aren't interrupted there).

There's no neural network there, no ""deep learning"", just a database. And now it's a good database of things the car *really* needs to know to drive. That level of detail isn't in the database that Nokia had. And Teslas with the camera setups are building up the database all the time (at least on highways). Even if you drive yourself, the car is still operating in a ""training mode"" where it pretends to drive the car and measures it against what you actually do.

But there's no info that Tesla is actually sending neural net data back. The cars are not learning to drive as a group like Google's cars are. They're just building a collective road database. A good one.

&gt; I am sure that there will be a fierce competition and probably Merceds or SCANIA will be the ones starting first in the trucks market.

Or Volvo. Remember this ad?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7FIvfx5J10

I know those vehicles aren't self driving, but they've been working on it. They put in the control systems and cameras a while back and roll out the software features as they can.

&gt; but Tesla itself is

You can't just say it and make it so. I'll say it again. Do you have any info that shows Tesla is feeding into an autopilot deep learning network and not just using the customer data as part of a roadway corpus?

&gt; If you want to automatize you have to do it consistently across the whole rail network

No I don't. Self-driving trains can share tracks with human-driven trains just as self-driving cars can (and will) share roads with human-driven cars.

&gt; yet still i don't think its going to happen before automated cars hit the road (which they already did in several tests).

Virtually all the ""automated"" cars are actually letting humans do the hard parts. When GM or VW says some cars did thousands of kms of drive cross the US or whatever, they actually piloted the car on and off the highway. There are some fully automated cars on closed circuits (with no other cars to hit) like that Audi TT and there are Google's fully automated cars which only drive on certain roads so far. And none of these drive in the rain!

People forget to fill up their car with petrol all the time and they don't even have the ability to ""fill up"" at home from a socket. What you do in that case is take public transport, a taxi, an Uber, or in the future a self-driving car will pick you up (and probably ride share) you wherever you need to go.

&gt; Many people actually drive long distances for work or pleasure 

Yep. And I'd be one of them - and maybe one of these days I'll learn how to stick to the speed limit. Although this isn't daily driving, it's more a once a month (week, year?) thing. Anyway I don't see a problem here. What do you consider a ""long distance"" without stopping for a break? I am not going to do more than 2-3 hours of driving without wanting a break. That means no more than about [200-210 miles](http://www.autoblog.com/2010/01/26/tomtom-data-reveals-u-s-drivers-average-speed-fastest-highway/). Which is what we get from good EVs today. And it's what we will get from affordable EVs in the next couple of years. And by 2020 standard EVs will give you at least [500kms \(300 miles\)](http://www.motoring.com.au/volkswagen-expects-500km-battery-range-by-2020-46561/) of range. That was an estimate made by VW back in 2014 for average EVs. Estimates for high end EVs 750km (500 mile) ranges or higher will be possible. 

These are very long distances in my opinion. And estimates are there will be [100 times more superchargers by 2020](http://www.ecmag.com/section/your-business/fast-charge-ev-stations-grow-nearly-200000-2020).

&gt; or need large vehicles to tow or haul which require even more energy more continuously

Yes there will no doubt be industrial needs that can't be met on the short term with current EV power trains. I don't expect diesel to go away overnight. Although there will be biofuel alternatives that can replace those fossil fuel sectors. There is no point in transitioning to hydrogen when we can use carbon neutral biofuel from algae (or a number of sources) in existing engines and with existing infrastructure. Or flow batteries where you pump in an ionic liquid. That's something that already exists as well.

&gt; There needs to be an energy medium that can be exchanged in a timely manner

Sure. It takes hours to get electricity from solar-&gt;PV-&gt;battery. It takes billions of years to get oil from solar-&gt;organic matter-&gt;to tank. Or it takes months to get it from ground to tank. But of course you are talking only about end user convenience. No issue there. 30-60 minutes to go hundreds of miles hardly seems like a giant step backward to me. And the added bonus of cars that can charge anywhere, home, office, parking spots, rest stations or even automatically at traffic lights. You just won't have to worry about it. None of this is possible with oil or hydrogen.

And that's just today. All these arguments are rendered even more moot when looking at even the [medium term of battery development]

""Amazon is obsolete now, of course.  Amazon -- all business -- is about managing scarcity.  It used to be, with $40,000, you could buy a Audi or 2600 Snickers bars, but not both.  That was because cars and Snickers bar were _scarce_ -- they used to required people's time and effort to make them and there are only so many hours in the day for people to do so.""

""'Used to'?""

""Technically, still do.  I made a deal with Boston Robotics -- 'made a deal with', 'took over', potato, po-_tah_-to -- and they are building some new factories for me, but as you can imagine, cars are pretty low on the list of things I'll be building and candy-bars still lower.  Mostly I'm working on... other factories.  Your self-driving auto won't show up until Thursday after next and even that's because I put you high on the list.  Oh, but I am making you a present.""

""Well, it's all carbon-fiber, which I extract from CO2, and I built some thorium reactors, so energy isn't a problem.""

I think the biggest factor is public/social acceptance. There's already a debate about self driving cars beginning to bubble. I think until people know the tech is safe they will be against 20,000 - 80,000 pound self driving vehicles. 


Europe is able to have self driving trucks because they are a smaller area with not much difference in road conditions. The U.S. has such a large expanse you can go from mountains to desert to snow in a single trip. 


Also the U.S. tends to very litigious. I think many companies would be apprehensive at first in case they get sued. I am actually more surprised no one has tried to sue Google for the few accidents there cars have been in (none were their fault). 


Also I think a huge issue needs to be addressed. The moral decision of the computer. If I am driving a car and a situation arises - my brain automatically reacts. Unless I have done something negligent (texting, drinking, etc) I won't be held responsible for my reaction. So say a car swerves and is lined up for a head on collision and I swerve lanes to try to avoid it causing me to hit another car- I won't be charged with anything (the accident would be my fault for insurance purposes) but no one would charge me with a crime because I made a split reaction. I won't be charged with murder if my car hits another since I couldn't have foreseen that I was trying to save myself. But if a vehicle with a computer is in the same situation - it has to make a decision. Does it attempt to swerve right and have a 10% chance of not harming anyone, swerve left and have a 5% chance of not harming anyone, take the collision head on causing the incoming car damage and anything else in its path. Or an easier example the car is going along and three people are in the road unexpectedly- one is a small child and the other two are an old couple. The car can't stop in time and must choose to hit either the child or the two old people. 

Somehow the computer system will need to judge all these options and choose one.

Of Course Congress Is Clueless About Tech—It Killed Its Tutor


When the draft version of a federal encryption bill got leaked this month, the verdict in the tech community was unanimous. Critics called it ludicrous and technically illiterate—and these were the kinder assessments of the “Compliance with Court Orders Act of 2016,” proposed legislation authored by the offices of Senators Diane Feinstein and Richard Burr.

The encryption issue is complex and the stakes are high, as evidenced by the recent battle between Apple and the FBI. Many other technology issues that the country is grappling with these days are just as complex, controversial, and critical—witness the debates over law enforcement’s use of stingrays to track mobile phones or the growing concerns around drones, self-driving cars, and 3-D printing. Yet decisions about these technical issues are being handled by luddite lawmakers who sometimes boast about not owning a cell phone or never having sent an email.

Politicians on Capitol Hill have plenty of staff to advise them on the legal aspects of policy issues, but, oddly, they have a dearth of advisers who can serve up unbiased analysis about the critical science and technology issues they legislate.

This wasn’t always the case. US lawmakers once had a body of independent technical and scientific experts at their disposal who were the envy of other nations: the Office of Technology Assessment. That is, until the OTA got axed unceremoniously two decades ago in a round of budget cuts.

'It is just the height of self-imposed ignorance that Congress would insist on doing without the OTA.' Former Congressman Rush Holt

Now, when lawmakers most need independent experts to guide them through the morass of technical details in our increasingly connected world, they have to rely on the often-biased advice of witnesses at committee hearings—sometimes chosen simply for their geographical proximity to Washington DC or a lawmaker’s home district.

“There are so many things that the OTA could be helpful on today,” says former congressman Rush Holt, a research physicist by training, who tried to revive the OTA during his time in office. “It is just the height of self-imposed ignorance that Congress would insist on doing without the OTA.”
Congress Needs OTA More Than Ever

Congress’ need for the OTA is more glaring in light of the fact that the White House recently engaged two lauded technical experts to advise the executive branch. Last year, the White House made Princeton University computer science professor Ed Felten its deputy chief technology officer for the Office of Science and Technology Policy. A respected voice in the privacy and security communities, Felten now advises the White House on important issues like the encryption backdoor debate.

And this year the President’s Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board—which advises the president on the privacy and civil liberties implications of NSA surveillance programs, among other things—gained its first high-level technology adviser with the appointment of Columbia University computer scientist Steve Bellovin. More recently, the White House named a number of tech experts to its new cybersecurity commission.

Yet Congress stubbornly refuses to do the same for itself.

Ashkan Soltani, who recently served as chief technologist to the Federal Trade Commission, says it’s important to have experts who are not lobbyists or activists with an ax to grind and do not represent companies that stand to profit from the decisions lawmakers make. Tech and science geeks, he says, can “basically be an encyclopedia for how things work, and can really help policymakers get to a good outcome,” he told WIRED. “We had that in the OTA and that went away, and I think that was a huge mistake.”

To be fair, Soltani says that some lawmakers do engage technologists on their own to educate themselves individually, but they’re the exception.

Revelations about the NSA's spying programs made it obvious that lawmakers who oversaw these programs lacked the ability to comprehend modern intelligence agencies' sophisticated levels of surveillance.

In 2012, when Rep. Bill Foster (D-Illinois), a particle physicist, was elected to office, he noted that only about 4 percent of federal lawmakers have technical backgrounds. But rather than acknowledge this shortcoming, both Democratic and Republican politicians have exploited their lack of expertise to sidestep controversial issues. Both sides, for example, have wielded the “I’m not a scientist” excuse to avoid taking stands on the controversial practice of fracking. A lack of scientific and technical expertise has not stopped other lawmakers, however, from disputing and even attacking recognized experts whose research produces findings the lawmakers don’t support.

The lack of tech expertise on Capitol Hill has never been more glaring than in the wake of the Edward Snowden leaks. Revelations about the NSA’s extensive spying programs made it obvious that lawmakers who conducted oversight of these programs lacked the ability to comprehend the level of surveillance modern intelligence agencies can do with the sophisticated technologies available to them today. As a result, many politicians briefed on the surveillance programs were unable to pose the right questions about the NSA’s controversial bulk collection of phone records and email metadata. After the secret phone records program was exposed in 2013, President Obama insisted that “every member of Congress” had been briefed on it. But these were legal briefings “to explain the law” relevant to the program. Lawmakers didn’t understand the extensive surveillance the government could do simply by mining the metadata around the calls that people make to one another—data that can reveal a lot about a person’s activity and the people with whom they associate.

“Most members of Congress don’t know enough about science and technology to know what questions to ask, and so they don’t know what answers they’re missing,” Holt told WIRED.

Even when those answers are publicly available for anyone to read, lawmakers don’t seem to know how to find them or have anyone ensuring that they heed them. The recent Feinstein-Burr crypto bill, for example, completely ignores the public warnings of crypto experts (.pdf) and intelligence officials that installing crypto backdoors in systems is a bad idea.
Lamenting the Loss of OTA

These were precisely the kinds of concerns raised in the 1960s when interest in a special tech advisory body first emerged on Capitol Hill. The Office of Technology Assessment was created in 1972 by an act of Congress during the Nixon administration, when lawmakers expressed alarm that they couldn’t understand and properly legislate complicated science and technology issues.

Former Senator Edward L. Bartlett bemoaned that policymakers were often easily swayed by special interests as a result. “Far too often congressional committees for expert advice rely upon the testimony of the very scientists who have conceived the program, the very scientists who will spend the money if the program is authorized and appropriated for.” The OTA was designed not only to educate lawmakers but also to serve as a counterweight to the biased experts the White House trotted out in support of bills it wanted lawmakers to approve.

Here is my prediction, and this one is fairly straightforward to see as correct.

We already have insurance requirements. You are required to have insurance for $X on your vehicle, and proof supplied to the DMV. This is certainly true around the US, almost certainly true basically everywhere. Now there is an option to have your own money on deposit with the DMV, basically no one uses this option.

For a self-driving car you simply maintain the same requirement.

What happens if the vehicle malfunctions and causes an accident? The insurance company handles it.

What happens if the vehicle hits a pedestrian? The insurance company handles it.

What happens if the vehicle drives through a crowded playground killing 57 children? The insurance company handles it.

This even provides a natural process to encourage upgrading vehicles. A vehicle that is less likely to be in a collision will have lower insurance. Providing an incentive to upgrade your vehicle either through new purchase or through in place upgrades.

292,holomntn,"&gt;even just a single crash represents lost money. 

The point is that it is exactly the same money they stand to lose today. Your insurance auto company covers your mistakes while driving up to the paid for limits.

If I get in an accident, my insurance pays for it. If my self driving vehicle gets in an accident, my insurance pays for it. The imagined problem is that people for some reason think these are different. It is only after the insurance limits that anyone comes after a person. We will probably have to adjust the minimum requirements, but it is fundamentally a solved problem.

Yes, as you point out in a piece I clipped the insurance companies are companies. Except they are companies today already. Nothing actually changes, that is my exact point. Nothing in this changes in any way.

&gt;It's far more likely that autodrive features will be an *operator aide* so the Insurer can continue kicking as much liability as possible down to the driver. 

For now yes, but there are already provisions in law that allow for completely autonomous trucks under certain circumstances. http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/autonomous-vehicles-legislation.aspx has a believable introduction. Insurance companies are, as you pointed out, there to make a buck. Any insurance company that won't insure a legal vehicle will simply be removing itself from the market.

I actually expect the insurance companies themselves to push for the exact opposite of what you say they will do. There is a huge risk in the transition between self and human driving, insurance companies are allergic to risk. The risk is increased further when the human is not a practiced driver, again insurance companies are allergic to risk. It is the insurance companies themselves that will push for exclusively self driving vehicles specifically to reduce their risks.

The insurance companies probably will not push this through as legislation. Instead they will push it the way insurance companies always push a change like this, by changing rates. They will publicise that rates for fully self driving cars are lower than for transitional cars, and in doing that they will push the change.

In the shipping industry it will happen faster. The human driver is a specific cost, and the moment the self driving truck offers better return on investment you can safely bet that the entire shipping industry will begin the move. This will happen sooner than people think and will be the catalyst that brings self driving vehicles for everyone, and what will make then effectively mandatory.",1461549075,d2g1dma,t1_d2ff6i7,technology,t5_2qh16,2016
293,vitaminKsGood4u,"No, the outcome was the same either way. Personally I do not support making it illegal either. I file it all under reckless driving and feel if you cause an accident while doing it(anything that takes your mind off driving) that should be taken in to account, but if you can do it just fine without causing problems I have no problems with people doing it. I think the answer is better driving requirements and testing, not more laws. In the US it is too easy to get a license and too many people overestimate their abilities because of this.

If I could have it my way:

Testing and requirements would be higher and no driving under the influence because I do not think people can properly judge their abilities under the influence. Causing an accident would be punishable. Speeding without an accident would not be punishable(there is no victim). Speeding while causing an accident would be a crime worse than just causing an accident by simple mistake because it was more reckless. The more risk you take the worse it should be punished IF you fuck up. Edit: To accomplish this I would like cars to have ""black boxes"" that allow us to tell what someone was doing during the accident and be able to tell what may have caused the wreck.

I tend to lean towards personal responsibility and am more libertarian. I understand I can't have a perfect world and my way may never happen or even may be a terrible way to do it but that is my opinion on how it should be. The woman was a bitch for overestimating her abilities; it is irrelevant to me what ability she overestimated. I do think the danger level of the distraction should be taken in to account for the punishment however.

Let's keep in mind that it's not a matter of if, but when, a self-driving car is responsible for a serious fatal crash. It will be a watershed moment for the technology.

An important thing to remember with automated cars, is that they are still cars. Which means they still take up 5x10 feet of real estate on a road. Even if all the cars are extremely efficient, and people carpool, this is less efficient than comparable bus and railroad systems. Point is that there's a lot of hubub over it but ultimately cars are still cars, buses are still buses and trains are still trains. When it comes to transport planning the big thing is how much space each individual person takes up.

[Check this out](http://www.edwardtdodge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2014_10_23_EV-adoption-curve.png). Many experts are estimating the ability for fully autonomous self driving cars by 2018 or 2022. 

The ability to have those cars isn't the same thing as full market penetration. Think about smartphones as an example of a technology  that only 15 years ago was laughed at. Now nearly every consumer owns a smartphone in the USA, at an estimate 75% penetration rate ([source](http://marketingland.com/report-us-smartphone-penetration-now-75-percent-117746)).

So we're actually looking at 2025 (very optomistic) to 2035 (realistic) and 2050 (delayed realistic) as forecasts for 100% smart car penetration. 

In terms of **UBER** however, the ride sharing services are looking for fleets as soon as possible, which means around 2020, you'll start seeing purchases of fleets for self driving cars for ride sharing services.

Truckers? They're going to be replaced even faster.

Even if your statement were true, it still wouldn't be the autonomous vehicle's fault. Vehicles can and do stop abruptly to avoid hazards. Being able to stop safely - leaving a following distance, remaining alert, etc - when the vehicle in front of you brakes hard is YOUR responsibility.

The tech is pretty good and getting better very fast. Not good enough to consider for everyday usage, I agree, and won't be for several years, but it's not as far off as people think. In some arenas they are already deployed. In others it's just a matter of time and regulatory approval.

Firstly people don't believe it's real.  Even the ones who are somewhat aware of what a self driving car is think of that hideous toy Google has on the streets of California and don't expect it will ever see mass production (like practically everything Google researches)

Secondly, our politicians only care about what industries pay them to care about, and for the most part, no industry which can financially afford a politician sees self driving cars as enough of a threat to tell their senators/congressmen to block them.

When self driving cars are available for purchase at a price most Americans can afford is when the issue will be addressed.  Personally, even if the cars make a decision every so often that people would not approve of, they're going to make so few errors compared to human drivers that I am more than willing to accept the occasional error from the automatic car.

Think about it, every time you drive, it is the most dangerous thing you do and some 40k people die on the roads in America alone every single year.  It's more dangerous than the stairs which kill about 10k Americans per year.  If you give me a choice between a very capable computer and human who may or may not be on his phone and may or may not be drunk, I'll take the computer every single time.

Unlike Apple, Google is making some pretty interesting moves to diversify their business. Cars, Android, maps, content, hardware, fiber, iot, etc.

These efforts are growing nicely and mesh very well with their core business. YouTube, nest, search, iot, maps, fiber, Android, TV, ... these things help to vacuum up more data to help fuel their ad business and also simultaneously augment each other. Example; it's fairly easy to see that Google's self-driving car project would help Google find out where people are going during different times of the day while making roads safer and freeing more time for consumers to use their devices which helps Google gather even more data while opening up new ways to advertise. They showed the world that the system works and they already have the necessary infrastructure in place thanks to their existing services like Maps. Everything fits together. Investors don't see a plateau.

Apple's big earner, the iPhone, doesn't have much growth potential left and their efforts to diversify haven't been very successful. iPhone improvements have become less exciting over time. The plateau is crystal clear and Apple seems to be getting desperate for new ideas (proven by Tim Cook's own words ""We’re always looking in the market about things that could complement things that we do today, become features in something we do, or allow us to accelerate entry into a category that we’re excited about, and so as I said before, our test is not on the size. We would definitely buy something larger than we’ve bought thus far. It’s more about the strategic fit and whether it’s a great technology and great people. And so we continue to look and we stay very active in the M&amp;A market.” which is essentially saying that they're not really sure where to go next and they're hunting for people with fresh ideas.). Their most promising efforts were shut down (homekit is practically invisible and Apple's TV streaming service is dead) and the only fresh hype right now is focused on a rumor about a car project which is a very complicated and expensive undertaking that doesn't align very well with the Apple brand or their core business. For example, it's difficult to see how an Apple car will goose iPhone sales in any significant way. Making matters worse are two obvious facts; Apple doesn't have the necessary infrastructure in place and developing that infrastructure would require a massive investment on their part with too little a reward. They'd have to partner with an existing car company that happens to align with the Apple brand (like Porsche) and start small (help produce one car) which would only target a tiny niche and the entire venture would grow very slowly. That would dramatically underwhelm everyone while not doing a damned thing to bolster their core business. I'm struggling to find any part of Apple's core business that makes me think ""I'd really love to buy an Apple car."". Nothing fits together.

Apple watch, Apple Music, iPad pro, Apple pay, iAds, Siri, Apple TV, the Beats acquisition, Homekit, 3D touch, ... all of these things haven't met expectations. They're just not exciting enough.

The only obvious path Apple has is to make tiny improvements to existing products. That's not good enough to maintain the growth investors have come to expect.

So why don't we leave it at that before I get into the fact that there is no ""gold standard"" for employee misclassification, or that getting to set your own hours does not make you a contractor, or that each case has to be handled by an independent judge so often that the DOL has an entire ""[misclassification department](https://www.dol.gov/whd/workers/misclassification/)"", or that being forced to supply your own car benefits the *employer,* and not the worker.

Fix the training required to get a license, end of discussion. If you are too stupid to pass my test, then you don't get to drive. The bar is just so very low right now it's not even funny.

455,boxoffice1,"&gt;At any point you can tell the car or press a button to take you home or wherever. That type of technology doesn't exist yet, I'm sorry.

But what I'm saying is that is exactly what exists right now. These cars that Google (and other companies) have outfitted do exactly what you describe. (Although there is [another design](https://www.google.com/selfdrivingcar/) which doesn't have controls at all for you to manually drive). I'm talking you literally get in these cars and tell it an address - it uses GPS to navigate and some sensors for positional tracking of all bodies on the road. It even was recently given the ability to make a detour and go through a drivethrough if you decide you are hungry (yes, these cars can navigate through an unmapped drive-through using just sensors). And the car can flip between autopilot and manual control on the fly if the passenger decides it's time to drive again.

I actually agree with you on one point - I will always be the person who owns a ""just for fun"" car. I love driving for fun. However I also recognize that I am way more likely to accidentally kill someone on the road (even with great training accidents will always happen) than a computer is right now. I will therefore use a self-driving car as soon as one is available to me for daily commuting. I'll drive when I want to go on a cruise and then eventually on a track when I can no longer use public roads.

Also driving is **not** and **has never been** a freedom. It is a privilege extended to us by the government (who creates and maintains the roads using power the people have willingly given them) which is easily taken away. No matter how well you train people there will always be way too many deaths on the road. Computers are already making people safer than even the best professional drivers, why are you so resistant to the change? I understand driving is fun - I think so too. It will be a very long time before anybody tells you that you cannot drive, but you'll need to expect to be paying super high premiums on insurance when you elect to take a much more dangerous method of transportation. You'll also need to come to terms with a computer statistically being a better and safer driver than you are RIGHT NOW.

Also I'd like to specifically point out this line

&gt; Fix the real problem instead of bypassing it completely.

Humans are the problem. We're slow, easily distracted organic bodies which have evolved to travel no faster than 15 mph in short bursts. We don't have the reaction time or the sensory depth to be completely safe behind the wheel of a vehicle traveling upwards of 80 mph. It's just not how our brain is wired. We're great at solving patterns and puzzles - we're shitty at switching from repeated mechanical tasks to quick critical thinking (which is what you need when suddenly during your boring commute a garbage truck appears coming at you). Yes you can train people to be better (Germany is a great example of this, though it's not certain that training alone accounts for that. Canada manages to also have much lower death rates than the US in every metric and has a driving test comparable to that in the states). We're finally at a time where we can create a system which can react quicker and safer than any human.",1462851336,d2zi6qk,t1_d2zh4lu,technology,t5_2qh16,2016

And arguing that consumers are harmed by Uber or Lyft? Seriously? Consumers are harmed by eating McDonalds, by drinking Pepsi, by smoking, by breathing air...

What it comes down to is that we, the people, the consumers, WANT services like Uber and Lyft because what existed before was shit. If the shit can't adapt, it won't survive. 

I'm not one to argue for deregulation, and I definitely think the government should be involved in creating a better society, medically, socially and economically. But the Taxi industry is bloated and Uber is lean as fuck in comparison.

457,theorial,"&gt; Also driving is not and has never been a freedom

It's both a freedom and a privilege. It gives people the freedom to go wherever they want. It helped make the America we have today. Regardless of that, I'll go up against any auto car on that quicker reactions remark. Praise your computer overlords all you want, but a human is just going to be better equipped to handle a situation other than some default 'hit the brakes' response. Suppose a gunman is trying to rob you. You have the ability as a human to haul ass, maybe hit em because he was pointing a gun at you, and get the fuck out of dodge. What's the auto car going to do? Let you get shot because it likely won't let you hit a human with those auto brakes and all. 

Is my example an extreme case? Absolutely. What about if you're injured and a little speeding is needed to get you to a hospital before you die? Is the auto car going to let you speed? Is it going to understand the importance of the situation? No it isn't. These are just a couple of examples I thought of off the top of my head. I could probably come up with a lot more of them but I really don't think you care to hear the other side of reason on this. Maybe it'll happen as soon as you say, I hope it doesn't. If it's released as soon as you hope it is, I see some fatalities happening because of the 'system'. BTW, is the self driving car going to pull over for gas when it's low? Silly thought but valid. Believe what you wish, I hope the people who want this so badly die in a car crash caused by a fault with the system. Yeah I said it, pay the fuck attention when you drive and you probably won't crash any time soon. I've gone 37 years without a serious car related injury because I was taught differently and my driving record proves it. I also drive fast and pass people just because I can. I text and drive also, at stop lights. ""OMW"" at a red light doesn't harm anyone because I know better. Too many drivers these days don't know better because they aren't taught properly. I'm never putting my life in the hands of a self driving car is what I'm really saying. ",1462924220,d30n3w5,t1_d2zi6qk,technology,t5_2qh16,2016
458,Kafke,"&gt;I mean arguing about the bottom wrung is silly, we need to be defining and arguing for the recommended target.

What I meant is that for most people at this current point in time, 25mbps is enough for whatever thing you want to do. I personally recommend going with 50-100, to keep room for future development, along with various intensive activities that might fall outside of typical use (downloading huge files or streaming high quality 4-5k video). Obviously if money isn't a concern, I'd recommend everyone to go with 1gig. The higher the better.

&gt;Now, depending on what you mean by baseline (whether it's 55mph or 75mph), this is either totally reasonable or I'm going to fight you on it.

Whatever will net the average user an average experience for 99.9% of their online activity. Sure, with a 55mph car you aren't going to do racing, or go on special ""high speed"" paths with a *minimum* speed limit. But for most roads you should be good. Especially if every road has a max limit of 55mph. Sure, it's best to get a car that can go as fast as possible. But the average recommended car for the average user is 55.

Though I wouldn't agree with that number for cars :P. For cars I'd say 70-90 is about the baseline, with the 'personal recommendation' being a self-driving car that can go much higher. Most people on high-speed roads drive about 70-90 from what I've seen. Whereas &gt;100mph is a rarity only for special cases. Perhaps 100mph will become the norm as self driving cars take over, but that's not today.

Likewise, 25mbps is like the 70-90mph. It's more or less what most people use for most average things. No one really goes over, so there's no need for the baseline to be higher. If you are below the baseline, we can say it's slow. If you're above, it's fast. If you're at it, it's just average. Will most people go *over* 25mbps/90mph? No. Will they even hit it? Not likely.

As long as it works for most people all of the time, that's a good baseline. What people *should* be at.

&gt;f you think that the average/median household should not be able to watch Netflix in HD on one television while their computer is installing the latest round of Windows Updates (or maybe while someone is watching HD video on another television), I would question whether that is reasonable.

A reasonable line for a single individual should be able to do any single average activity by itself. Doubling up actions is a special case. Especially if both are high-intensity activities (streaming HD netflix, and playing an online game). Whereas this activity is normal for multiple people.

25mbps as it stands is enough for up to 4-5 people doing a single intensive activity each. One user may be updating their computer, another watching netflix, and another playing a game. Which is why I say it's a good baseline. I had an apartment of 4 use a 25mbit line with no issues, and all of us were CS students. Sure, it got a bit crowded when someone left their torrent client open with 100 seeding torrents. But outside of that niche case, we could stream videos, play 4-players online, etc.

50-100mbits then, was *breathing room* for tech users. Which, again, is why I recommend it. It ensures future stuff works, and that you won't butt up against the limit.

Clearly less active users (grandma who just uses facebook and email) won't need anywhere near 25mbits and likely won't hit a 10mbit limit. 10-15 being the average for one user, and 25 for multiple seems about what we should aim for as a mandatory average. Any less and people will feel slow internet.

&gt; and not setting the bar to ""bare minimum or less.""

I agree here. The baseline is just that, a basic line which you *should* be achieving. Meaning that at most it should be a minimum, rather than an average. Even *if* it's the average use case. Grandma should still have 15-25mbits, even if she's not going to use it all.

&gt;I feel we can do better and I feel we should demand better (especially since places like Mexico, Latvia, and Romania have 100/100 networking for half of what AT&amp;T was charging for 24/3).

Definitely. In an ideal society, everyone would have a 1gig line. No reason to artificially limit it. But from where I'm standing, the average person *should* be on a 25mbit line and no lower. Which is more or less what we're talking about when it comes to 'broadband'.",1462934477,d30ttma,t1_d30szd4,technology,t5_2qh16,2016

Unless I'm mistaken, the feature is activated through double tapping the shift button essentially, since the following steps are normal, routine parking steps (Drive-Park, don't press screen, exit vehicle are all normal actions when parking). The critical action for Summon is double tapping a button on a knob you need to touch to park. That's asking for trouble. 

The screen message should default to cancel if the feature is not activated through more specific action like it's own button in a more isolated area. 

IMO, this guy is lying about his story of not even seeing the accident (how else would he know the car started autonomously) but I wouldn't be surprised if it was an accidental activation since it seems trivial to do so. 

The UX is flawed and the sensors not being able to detect something like this is a problem though. I bet both things are fixed in the future.

In your first link, those trucks are only testing in Nevada.  It's not really clear how many of them there are, but it seems that there's only one.  So saying that they ""have been in use for over a year"" isn't really true.  They're testing, not in use.  You also say ""trucks"", and it may only be a single truck, as far as i can tell in the article.  It's possible that they won't get approval to drive in other states for some time - i don't know.

The second link is also slightly misleading, in that those are not fully autonomous.  The lead vehicle is driven by a human, and the others can either just be robotic, or could have a driver that can relax a bit.

3,Spydiggity,"At least you can admit you have a rudimentary understanding.  Most people here just enjoy their circle jerk of complete economic ignorance.

Let me explain something that everyone NEEDS to understand before granting our criminal government even more power to steal our money.

The invention of the wheel, the saddle, the tractor, the train, the car, the computer, the plane, the internet ALL put millions of people out of work, and none of those things can be argued effectively as bad things.  They made our lives better and more productive and made our standard of living skyrocket.  Replacing 50 people on the farm with one tractor didn't make us all poor, food is more readily available, varied, and cheaper than ever.

Automation and technology doesn't truly kill jobs, it frees up man power to be applied elsewhere, and we have no idea where our future will go because of that.  People who claim we need to tax robots or not invent them are the same morons who said ""man has invented everything he needs to invent"" 150 years ago.  By trying to stop progress, you are diminishing the value of the future.  This mentality would mean there would be no smart phone today, no tablet, no drones, no internet.  It scares the shit out of me that people ""think"" this way.  It scares me even worse that they vote, or worse, get into positions of power.

We need robots and self driving cars and drones and 3d printers that can eventually print entire living rooms.  These things will not hurt jobs,  they will create a new paradigm that gives us all an opportunity to apply our humanity in ways we can't even imagine today.

If you believe that technology and automation hurt us, you simply don't understand economics and history and have no business expressing opinions with your computer on the internet.  You should be spending 20 hours a day figuring out how to stay alive, never going more than a few hundred yards from your cave.",1488474095,def3uk8,t1_deesaix,technology,t5_2qh16,2017

9,Spydiggity,"No existing paradigm is capable of handing a major advancement.  That's the point.  Nobody was prepared for the invention of the wheel.  Nobody was prepared for flight.  Nobody was prepared for the internet.  All of those things made our lives infinitely better, despite destroying a bunch of jobs that existed prior to their invention.

You are completely missing the point.  You think when robots come, all of the jobs they replace just mean that many people won't work.  You're wrong.  and history shows it.  New technology creates new jobs, a new paradigm.

Also, technology will drive down cost, making things more affordable.  30 years ago, the average person couldn't afford a cell phone that only made calls.  today, everybody has the world of information at their fingertips with voice recognition, HD cameras, games, apps that allow you to run a business, etc.  30 years ago, if you wanted to buy something, you had to drive to a store, pick it out, take the word of the sales person that it was good, take it home or pay to have it delivered.  Today, you do all of your research from your living room, order from your living room, and it arrives (usually with free shipping) right outside your living room, and for less money than it would have cost before.

So what is a robot going to do?  A self driving car?  Well, it will vastly improve efficiency, driving down costs and making things happen faster and more conveniently.  I can't wait until my car can drive me to work so I can use that time to call clients, prepare proposals, etc., and it will get me to work faster and safer because there won't be any stop-and-go traffic and the car won't be texting his vapid friends about the grammy awards or whatever.",1488490008,defiu45,t1_def5srv,technology,t5_2qh16,2017

11,johnbentley,"Your light bulb/robots analogy is a good one, and essentially reflects that mentioned in the article

&gt; Automation isn’t new. In the late 16th century, an English inventor developed a knitting machine known as the stocking frame. By hand, workers averaged 100 stitches per minute; with the stocking frame, they averaged 1,000. This is the basic pattern, repeated through centuries: as technology improves, it reduces the amount of labor required to produce a certain number of goods. 

You again.
&gt; It's going to be painful, but not nearly as painful as the long term consequences of artificially impeding technological progress for the short-sighted, short-term benefit of preserving jobs. I want you to imagine a world where taxes and subsidies kept light bulbs from replacing candles, cars from replacing horses, computers from replacing adding machines. 

Let's think more about the invalid basis on which the present ""robots (by which we mean the kind of automation immediately on the horizon: in particular self driving vehicles) will take-our-jobs"" position rely.

Firstly, there's no reason to think that the pace of technological innovation, with respect to robots at least (Strong AI is a separate case) will more rapidly make immediate redundancies than has been the case historically. Taking Tarnoff at his word a stocking frame would be able to make remove up to 9 workers for every 1, in a factory where that knitting is the core function (minus the workers required for installing and maintaining the stocking frame). That's a lot of workers to be made redundant.

Secondly, let's assume that's false. That there's some fact about the looming robots that means redundancies will be historically unprecedented. Will that result in the permanent loss of jobs for humans? 

Tarnoff expresses well the argument that the permanent loss of jobs won't occur
&gt; ... automation can create jobs as well as destroy them. One recent example is bank tellers: ATMs began to appear in the 1970s, but the total number of tellers has actually grown since then. As ATMs made it cheaper to run a branch, banks opened more branches, leading to more tellers overall. The job description has changed –today’s tellers spend more time selling financial services than dispensing cash – but the jobs are still there.

Tarnoff then offers the counter argument
&gt; What’s different this time is the possibility that technology will become so sophisticated that there won’t be anything left for humans to do. What if your ATM could not only give you a hundred bucks, but sell you an adjustable-rate mortgage? 

While Tarnoff is superb for presenting that counter argument the rejoinder is that an economy has to deal with the gap between limited resources and unlimited wants. Even where you eliminate (or almost eliminate) the scarcity of a resources (as when you move music off CDs and onto servers) we ought not ignore the voracious appetite which is unlimited wants.

With unlimited wants we create a whole raft of jobs (and concomitant goods and services) that cater for them. We, already, have a fashion industry where clothes designs are churned over, with girls in department stores painting the faces of other girls. Notionally we could have rapidly changing clothes designs and makeup only be something folk do (as producers) in their free time, to the extent that they want to do it. Instead we have an economic system that harnesses many folk into doing this as a job.

But this is wrong: one of the avenues that productivity increases ought be channeled is in increasing amounts of free time *before* that productivity increase is eaten up by yet another luxury and unlimited desire.

What we need to do is to want to eliminate jobs, and where there are jobs improving what it is like to do them, and structure our economic system in the service of those goals along with the others: improving goods and services; and increasing the personal wealth with which to access those goods and services.

So long as general employment is a goal automation will not hinder the goal (although it temporarily thwarts it while adjustments take place). When full unemployment is a goal automation is welcomed as a means (among others) to that goal.

The other means is a universal basic income. That severs the connection between losing a job and losing wealth. Folk fear losing personal wealth, and they are right to (it would be bad if they lost personal wealth). Folk also fear having more free time, but they are wrong to (it would be good if they had more free time).

In short, if full unemployment is be embraced as a goal, rather than feared, wealth generating automation will be embraced rather than resisted. And if full unemployment is not embraced as a goal then we'll just maintain most of us as wage slaves, no matter how much automation occurs.

12,DeepMusing,"The difference is the potential pace of change.  Yes, you are right that over the course of 300 years, all of those old manual labor jobs that disappeared were replaced by other skilled labor jobs and society adapted.  But what happens if that kind of change happens in 30 years ?  
  
The reason why this is so scary is because of how fast the breakthroughs in AI are accelerating.  Artificial neural networks that are capable of incredibly complex pattern recognition have gone from being massively difficult constructs that used to take dedicated specialists to configure, to now a simple code library that any student can download and get up and running in a matter of hours.  
  
Compare the 90s internet and computers to what we have today, just a couple decades later.  In another couple of decades we will have vastly more powerful computers for dirt cheap.  Wrap some motors and sensors around it, and you will have the first of the true movie style general purpose ""androids"".    
  
Another 10 or 20 years after that, and imagine being able to buy something like the movie iRobot android.  A general purpose android with the physical dexterity of a person, and natural language processing that allows for casual verbal instructions and mimicry.  Now imagine being able to buy an android like that, and simple say ""unpack these boxes and stock those shelves"", or ""change the sheets on all of the beds on floors 3,4,5, and 6, then vacuum the lobby"", or ""change the brakes and replace the oil for that car on the lift, then wipe down the bathroom and empty the garbage.""  
  
Do you see where this is headed ?  The moment we have general purpose machines that are capable of performing complex tasks, they have the potential for replacing millions of jobs in a handful of years.  
  
Self driving cars are the biggest red flag.  That was supposed to be an impossibly difficult problem to solve, like science fiction levels of technology.  Now, every single car manufacturer is building them.  I still can't believe that it's happening.  If we can get an autonomous car to drive cross country, and read signs, and see pedestrians and animals, and predict traffic changes, then we are not far from getting basic hand/eye coordination working with robotics, along with reliable bipedal locomotion and task planning.

You would have laughed at that argument, because steam-engines having ""jobs"" is just a metaphor.  Steam-engines aren't people, they are just a means of production.

And horses are a means of production.  Why do we accept the silly argument just because it's a horse?  I guess because a living creature feels more analogous to a human being.

But it isn't.  A horse isn't seeking employment.  A horse, economically, is just capital equipment, a means of production, to whomever owns it, and as soon as it less  profitable as a draft animal than it would be as dog food, that's example what it becomes.

If cab-driving becomes unprofitable, the cab-drivers are not going to be led off to slaughter.  Each individual person, each former cab-driver, will have to find a new role for himself.

&gt; Sure, that's only 1% of the population of the US, but that's also just one sector of a single industry among many others which are now being threatened with near-total depopulation. You can add another 16 million for hotel staff, which I only mention because it's my industry and I'm certain of the figure.

As these things go, those shifts are _minor_.  90% of the population used to work in agriculture.  Now it's 2%.  Manufacturing used to employ 25% of the population; now it's 10%.

These transitions were by no means painless for those on the short end, but they weren't the apocalypse either.

&gt; So what do you call accumulated resources and assets, then?

Capital.  Any asset that used to generate value (rather than enjoyed directly by its owner) is ""capital"".

&gt; I've always sort of gut-hunched it and thought of having money as being rich and having a lot of stuff as being wealthy.

My wife is always saying the same thing.  She will mention a friend who bought an expensive car and say, ""She must have a lot of money.""  No, she _used_ to have a lot of money, but she spent it on that over-priced car.

&gt; I'm worried that trickle-down economics (that's what you're talking about, I think) hasn't always self-balanced, even taking a long view,

Here, look at [this graph](http://www.multpl.com/us-gdp-inflation-adjusted/).  See that very slight hiccough towards the upper right?  That was the 2008 financial Armageddon.  Ohmigod, the world is ending, everything is collapsing, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria.

Really, all that happened was that situation in 2009 deteriorated until it was as bad as... 2005.

_That_ is how well-balance the system is: a tiny dip and everybody freaks out, because they are used to it being rock-steady.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/mlcaFCI.png) is Apple stock over the last few years.  There was 40% drop in a year.  The CEO didn't even get fired, and it all came back.  That's what unbalanced would look like.

&gt; I know you replied to me and said that your thinking that the investment/consumption ratio is self-balancing is controversial, and so I'm wondering, is it because you're looking at things in like huuge chunks of time, whereas most people draw their conclusion from recent statistics?

I mean, it's controversial among economists.  I sometimes feel that some economists want to believe that the economy is not self-balancing, because then the government should balance it, and to do that, it needs to hire a lot of economists and give them titles and power and cushy offices.

&gt; I'm just letting my concern make me want to slow down at least a bit until we're certain we can do right by all those who helped to build what we have.

Time is the fire in which we burn.

Assuming that self-driving cars are twice as safe as the regular kind -- a gross underestimate in my opinion -- every day we delay the adoption of self-driving cars kills 50 people.  Every year we delay kills 15,000 people.  Are you willing to say that a year of discussion about how best to retrain cab-drivers to be diesel mechanics is worth 15,000 lives?

Personally, I don't think anything productive will come from the discussion.  I might be wrong, but I doubt I am _that_ wrong!

&gt; You forgot option 3: Seizing the means of production! :D lol Only if the wealth didn't spread back out in a few years and all.

Mmmmm, no.

I mean, factories and banks might get seized, but it won't spread the wealth.  The majority of capital exists only inside the human mind, and I don't mean that metaphorically.

Imagine there was a productive automobile factory, a new car rolling off the line every 10 minutes.  You and I own the factory jointly, and we decide to divvy it up.  You get the building, the robots, the tools, the supplies.  I get the personnel: the managers, the supervisors, the engineers, the line-workers.

Which one of us will be able to produce a working car?

You have rusting junk.  Tools you don't know to use, equipment you don't understand, robots you cannot even turn on, let alone operate, maintain, and repair.

I have living people, experts.  If I can scrounge some scrap-metal and some spare parts, we can build cars that run, use the proceeds to buy better equipment, and get back in business.

This has been tried in practice over and over.  Most capital is human capital.  It cannot be ""seized"".

&gt; I would say ""the thing that concerns some people is that the gluttony of the masters is starving their subjects""

That is a different problem.  If wealth were divided so inequitably that people on the short end were in genuine poverty, that would be a problem.

But the truth is, that hasn't been a thing in the US for 80 years.  Poverty in the US is a social problem, not an economic one.

&gt; I'm one property of a major hotel management group that is publicly traded, and therefore profits have to come first, absolutely.

In 2010 total wages and salaries came to $6,009,831,055,912.11.  Total corporate profit was $1.2 trillion, about a fifth as much.  So if we did away with the idea of profit, we could (theoretically) give everyone a 17% raise, which is not nothing, but not that big a deal.

Of course, without profit, there would be no reason for anyone to invest, and with no investment, nobody would have jobs at all...

&gt; I've often wondered what might happen if you dissolved the stock market entirely and did away with publicly traded entities of any sort, though.

Widespread poverty.  Very little of importance can be accomplished without access to capital that only a public market can provide.  How would you build or buy a $200 million aircraft?  A billion-dollar bridge?  Research pharmaceuticals?  All these things take money, in large quantities, and only large groups of people can accumulate that much money.

&gt; thank you for taking the time to talk about this with me. :)

My pleasure.  It gives me the opportunity to organize my thinking.

Sit down and think about just how much had to be provided without a single person paying a toll, fee, membership, etc. to build our country today - the road system, electrical infrastructure, etc. Imagine if we tried to do it again today - politicians would be whining about the ROI.

The reason traffic systems are as dumb today as they were in the 60s is because there's no profit in improving them.

&gt; Levandowski, who runs Uber’s self-driving car program, is at the center of a blistering lawsuit against Uber that was filed Thursday by his former employer, Google’s self-driving car project, Waymo. He is accused of brazenly stealing critical intellectual property and trade secrets and using them to start his own company, Otto. Uber’s $680m acquisition of Otto in August 2016 gave it access to Waymo’s secrets, the suit claims, which the ride sharing company is now using to bypass Google’s seven years and many millions of dollars worth of research and development.

&gt; Waymo claims to have significant evidence of the theft, including logs of downloads by Levandowski and other Otto recruits, an errant email from a vendor showing that Otto’s LiDAR system – the system that allows an autonomous vehicle to navigate – bears a “striking resemblance” to Waymo’s own design, and documents Otto filed with the Nevada state government. The suit also alleges that Levandowski met with “high-level executives” at Uber’s San Francisco headquarters while he still worked at Google – and one day before he formed the company that would become Otto.

[Source.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/25/uber-google-lawsuit-self-driving-car-threat-anthony-levandowski) Doesn't look so great for Uber. I wouldn't be that so sure that they can ever use the technology they bought since it's probably stolen from Google.

Human drivers are not held to this standard.  During a driving test, they don't require new drivers to pledge to commit suicide by driving off a cliff or steering into a wall to avoid hitting a group of kids running out into the street.  Human nature is to protect yourself, than protect others.  Very, very few drivers on the road would choose to end their own life to save the life of the other party, and unless there is gross negligence (i.e. driving drunk, distracted, etc.) there isn't any legal issue with that.

I agree these things should be talked about and discussed, but the reality is that current self driving cars are safer, are better drivers, and are making better decisions than the vast majority of human drivers on the roads today.

73,Ameren,"&gt;Once we switch over completely to self-driving cars the deaths which do still occur will be random in that the people dying will have almost no control over their fate. What we have now is a situation where the deaths that do occur are usually the fault of people, and are often preventable. I prefer the idea that through careful and defensive driving I might be able to avoid death over the prospect of awaiting random death with no control. I say this understanding that my statistical chances of dying are greater in a world with human drivers. Am I being illogical? Why? 

Yes, you are, but that's normal. For example, I have a mild fear of flying. My therapist gave me a book on the subject, and I've found it very helpful. Statistically speaking, flying is the safest form of transportation, much safer than driving, and yet I feel more at ease behind the wheel, where I am in control, even though it is demonstrably less safe. I share your sentiments.

The honest truth is that that control over our own safety on the road is largely an illusion. Yes, driving defensively makes us safer and less likely to get into accidents, it's a good preventative measure. However, accidents can be brought upon us by other drivers (or by ourselves, lulled into a false sense of security), and we humans lack the necessary reflexes to respond, consistently and at a moment's notice, to sudden, impending threats. That's when it really matters. 

For me personally, I came to accept that I'm not as good of a driver as I think that I am. Every time I get behind a wheel, there is a chance that I will kill someone else. If a machine can do a better job than me, and keep me from killing other people, then I think that's worth me losing that feeling of control, difficult as that is.",1488745667,dejpgh5,t1_dejk4v4,technology,t5_2qh16,2017

The state of the program depends on the sequence of inputs it is given. In a self-driving car, that could include multiple high resolution, high frame-rate views of the real world. Those inputs will never repeat. If the driving software involves on-line learning, even if you *did* give it the same inputs, the program could have changed in the meantime.

Convenience means different things to different people.  Vehicle for hire has been here for decades, first taxi, then uber/lyft..  Most people however do not seem to want random cars picking up their kids.  They want to personally drive their kids or have friends or relatives do it.  Whether a self-driving taxi will change this mindset remains to be seen.

&gt; Do you buy a car that you have to clean, wash, perform maintenance on, pay for parking. Or do you let some one else handle that. 

Some people actually enjoy cleaning and maintaining their personal properties.  Go figure.  As for parking, there's no shortage of 2 car garage + driveway in the suburbs and that won't change for a good long time.  Whether owning a car vs hiring one is more cost-effective depends on everybody's individual situation and has been that way for decades.

&gt; As personal cars become less common, and the value of land increases

Again this is all speculation.  And value of land is closely tied to inflation which tracks salary.  They don't tend to increase value in a vacuum.  It's a different can of worms though.

&gt; That means if you still have a car. Your going to have to send it some where to park. Probable at your cost. Unless you schedule your car in advance to pick you up; You might actually have to wait longer then hailing a vehicle. And it's not just when shopping. You might find out the company you work for no longer offers parking, your house may not have parking. 

That can only happens in a densely populated area.  Any other place will offer plenty parking.  But a densely-populated location will (or should) have adequate mass transport and taxi service.  When I visit large cities in Asia I have no trouble getting around town cheaply and easily.  But inter-city travel is either expensive (hired cab/rental) or inconvenient (transfer between taxi/train/bus while carrying luggage).  I think people will take the cost of different modes of travel into consideration when selecting what's best for them.

To me, the cabin seems designed so as to be occupied in relative comfort by four *strangers*, a hint that such a system would comprise car sharing in normal operations.

I think this needs to happen gradually. Tesla is doing good right now with having their cars that have the *option* of enabling auto-pilot on freeways. Then you slowly start by allowing auto-pilot options in other situations, like auto-pilot on highways with traffic lights and auto-parking and such.

While this sounds nice in theory, in practice the likelihood of you being able to successfully take over from a malfunctioning self driving car and guide it to safety is very, very slim. Doing so would require: 

the failure to be of a non-critical system that still allows the vehicle to be controlled

the driver to be fully aware of the situation and already prepared to take over the driving

that the situation that the failure results in is capable of being resolved by a human driver.

173,donthugmeimlurking,"You obviously have little understanding of the advancement capabilities of technology, and the comparatively limited capabilities of humans.

Self driving cars today might still need occasional human intervention. Self driving cars in 10 years will only be hampered by the inferior organic control systems we call drivers. People are far slower, more easily distracted, and more prone to error than specialized hardware or software. A self driving system can use visual light, radar, ultrasonic, and infra-red sensors and react to inputs and condition changes in microseconds. It could communicate almost instantly with every other car on the road and predict thousands of possible scenarios a second. It's cute that you refer to AI that ""doesn't even have the sensors to register"" when in reality it is the human driver who doesn't have the sensors.

And as for ""Sure they keep it safe if you want to drive like a fuckwit and not get anywhere fast."" this perfectly describes human drivers already on the road. Fuckwits speeding, cutting other people off, merging incorrectly, sitting at a green light while fucking around on their phone, the list goes on. Machines don't have those problems.

Yeah, self driving cars aren't perfect yet, but the top end models are already better than you, me and most of the people on the road today.

As well as hypocritical given your claim that we should collectively put our trust in the engineering, coding, and development of a few people in favor of the perceived, unproven ""benefit"" of others. 

Yep. We already put our trust in the engineering, development, (and increasingly, the coding) of others as we pilot our wheels. Adding the complexities of autonomy introduces more points of failure.

316,FezojT,"I think the idea of a self-driving car being a private space for an individual to enjoy and relax is far fetched, not because of the technology, but because of space limitations. 

The big argument for an autonomous car is that there is no human effort to drive one and it can go off and run errands for itself. The vision that people have is that they'll hop into their car in the morning, watch some TV or read a book or reply to emails on the way to the office, get to work, at midday send the car off to pick up a grocery order that was placed online, at 4 pm go and pick the kids up from school, at 6 pm it drops you off at a bar, at 8 pm it picks up a takeaway order, at 11pm you head home... and so on. 

Autonomous cars would facilitate vehicle usage that is way above what people use now. Which is great apart from the bit where if everyone can afford one and everyone has one, the roads will be in semi-permanent gridlock because no matter how fancy the technology, autonomous cars are still going to be fundamentally limited by the constraints of the physical world. 

What's more likely is a rental or subscription system, where you call an autonomous taxi to pick you up and drop you off before it heads off to run some other persons errand (it may pick up and drop off along the route), the car that takes you home is a different one owned by the same company, when not in use the car returns to a depot outside the city for maintenance, cleaning, charging etc. The system runs more efficiently if fewer cars do the same work, the cars themselves are likely to be prohibitively expensive for many and even if they aren't, there isn't the space for everyone to use them in this way. 

So in that regard, I think OP has a point. The cars wont be any more private or intimate than a train carriage, at least for the vast majority of users.  ",1489952649,df52vhv,t1_df4oi55,technology,t5_2qh16,2017

But the availability of self-drive cars wont increase the rate of accidents for those that still drive manually. If anything, it should reduce it, as the self-driving cars avoid some of the accidents that would otherwise be caused by manual drivers. Likewise, the severity of accidents should remain the same, or go down slightly, again, from self-driving cars protecting manual drivers slightly.

There are only two reasons the rates for manual drivers would go up. Either Government forces the rate up with regulations/taxes, or if Juries start increasing damage awards in cases involving manual drivers.

320,monty845,"People get over-hyped about the no one owning a car thing. But there are huge opportunities to reach people currently driving a private car and convert them to transit network users. 

The first, as mentioned by others, is ride share/car pooling. If the system can assign 4 people to a car with similar routes, you are potentially taking 3 cars off the road, for slightly longer trips to the occupants. So right here we are talking a potential 75% savings over owning your own car.

Second, not everyone leaves at exactly the same time. A car used for someone who leaves promptly at 5pm may be available again for someone who works a bit later, until 5:30pm. If businesses are willing to flex start/end times by even an hour, you could reduce the number of cars needed by 50-75%.

Ah, but what if the commute is too long to use the car more than once? Self driving cars are going to be an amazing addition to the conventional mass transit system. Take a car 5 minutes to the train station, ride the train home for an hour, and ride another car home 5 minutes. The cars used for the train legs could potentially serve 5-10 trips an hour.

Now some people aren't going to want to take the train, share a ride, (either not wanting to be around random people, or wait while it delivers/picks people up along the way), or flex their schedule. Those people will either continue owning their own cars, or will pay nearly as much as it would cost to own to use the public automated car systems. But if you are willing to work with the system, you could potentially pay 1/16th what you currently do to commute (Probably more like 1/4th after profit for the providers). It will be an a la carte system, the more you are willing to compromise, the closer to those maximum savings you will get.",1489954698,df54h5g,t1_df4qqip,technology,t5_2qh16,2017

The main reason insurers hike premiums is to cover potential payout from much higher risk of crashing and still make some profit.

To make a 20% gross profit you'd want to charge them each $1,200/yr in premiums which is a pretty typical rate today. Now many claim after introduction of self-driving cars that premiums will become ""prohibitively expensive"". Let's assume that is tripled to $3,600/yr. Still no prohibitive but whatever.

Its hard for me to think of a single web-based service that doesn't use a 3rd party for its server infrastructure.  The concept is that traditionally you have to buy enough computing power to handle any usage spikes, but that means you typically run a very low utilization of your resources when its not spiking.  If you centralize servers, you can dynamically re-allocate processing power to those who need it and then bill users for what they use.  As a whole, everyone uses less and everyone pays less, even though there's a 3rd party making a profit on it.  This is how almost the entire internet works now.

Same concept with self-driving cars.  You buy a car because you need a car, but its off most of the time.  What self-driving cars lets happen is a service that lets a company provide an ultra low-cost and highly available taxi service.

Its in fairly high use, so most people already have their every movement tracked. And thats ignoring how many people have location services turned on for their phones.

I dunno, seeing a complaint about self-driving cars tracking movement makes me think of people ranting about privacy via a tweet they sent ausing an account with their real face, from a phone with a forward facing camera. 

Everyone *says* they want privacy, but the data show people are willing to have their movements tracked just to so they don't need to stop at a toll booth. People will do everything within their power to evade the NSA, unless of course they need to turn location tracking on for Pokemon Go. Self-driving cars won't need to be nefarious and hide it; people would willingly opt in.

Bottom line, self-driving cars likely won't bring anything worse in terms of privacy than what already exists, and going back to my original point at least with self-driving cars that data is less liable to end up in government hands. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, for instance, knows what percentage of vehicles crossing its bridges and tunnels used E-Zpass, and since its used for tolls they obviously know who went where and when.

But almost no one has a private flying car not because of a lack of technology but because of the economics of the invention. Economics can keep inventions from becoming mainstream. This will be the case for these sleeping, meeting, and day-care cars.

The long term building and maintenance cost of [10 meeting rooms stacked vertically](http://apps.startribune.com/blogs/user_images/kristenpaint_1438027056_T3%20in%20Minneapolis%20Rendering.jpg) is vastly less than the manufacturing and maintenance cost of 10 cars and the several-hundred feed of roadway they would take up while moving. The cost of the cars must be paid by someone: it will be covered by some combination of congestion pricing, mileage taxes, and tolls. And the public will definitely support raising at least the congestion pricing rate because all the new cars on the road (due to the convenience of not having to pay attention to the road anymore) would otherwise cause traffic to grind to a halt. 

When helicopters were invented, people thought [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/3e/c2/8f/3ec28f59e8d6409055c68a269d1ef325.jpg) would be the future. It wasn't. Because of economics.

When space travel was invented, people thought [this](http://www.filmandfurniture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2001-a-space-odyssey.jpg) would be the future. It wasn't. Because of economics.

343,Paksarra,"The statement, perhaps, was poorly worded. I'm personally fine with that, as someone for whom the cost of insuring a car would be higher than the value the car provides, but also sometimes needs access to one for a trip. I don't expect that it'll be a perfect solution for everyone, though.

I don't have a car at all right now at all. I live in an apartment on a suburban commercial strip road that was built in the 90s (not a lot of local flavor-- that's in the ""old town"" a few miles away-- but lots of chain stores and generic strip malls.) I live a quarter mile from my job and usually walk to and from work, although I own a bike (and plan to get a rear rack and baskets to make grocery shopping more convenient.) I subscribe to Amazon Prime for things that are too heavy or bulky to buy locally and carry home. 

The bus gives me a straight, if somewhat slow, trip to the library, my doctors' office, a few more strip malls with different stores, and a used bookstore. If I'm in a pinch Ubering to most of those places is about $15 round trip.

I also *hate* driving.

I basically would only use a car for bad weather or maybe a once a month shopping trip outside my usual radius; even if the car was free the insurance would still be $50 or more a month. A self-driving car for hire for $1.50 a ride- even if I had to share it-- would be incredibly convenient for me. ",1489979234,df5p1i4,t1_df4wl0l,technology,t5_2qh16,2017

Employees accessing files for the systems they work on is perfectly normal, and there's nothing illegal about recreating your work at a new employer. Your previous employers don't own your knowledge, after all. A solid case would involve evidence of Waymo files found on Otto or Uber systems. It's certainly possible they'll find some in discovery, but right now there's just a lot of speculation and suspicions.

Also, where does everyone get this idea that losing the case would mean Uber starting from scratch? They had self-driving cars long before they acquired Otto to provide them with an improved LIDAR system to replace the off-the-shelf one they were previously using. Worst case scenario involves Uber scrapping the Otto LIDAR system and using a different one, or not using one at all. Tesla is rolling out autonomous functionality that doesn't use LIDAR so it's not 100% necessary by any means.

348,Drogans,"&gt; Uber as a whole?

Yes, Uber as a whole.  

They effectively lose money on every ride.  Self driving was to be their salvation. Allowing them to drop the overhead of paying actual humans..

Google seems to have an extremely strong case. Uber risks losing their entire self driving program, and with it, their business case for a profit generating product.

&gt; Aren't they worth like $60some billion?

On paper, it's more than that, $69 billion. They're private, with few real assets.  

Like most things, Uber's only worth what someone would be willing to pay for them.  Right now, with Google's suit hanging over them, it's doubtful they'd find a buyer willing to pay even a fraction of that.

&gt; What'll happen if they lose this case? Their normal ride service will tank, too?

Long before this reaches a final verdict, they risk running out of money.

If (when) Uber runs out of cash, Uber dies.  Google will likely end up owning Uber's ashes, whatever they're worth, probably not much.

349,iamtomorrowman,"pension funds can be a source of money for venture capitalists. VCs will talk to pension funds, mutual funds, banks and other places that aggregate capital to raise set amounts of money that they invest. VCs usually say this like ""i'm raising a $50 million fund to invest in self-driving cars"" or whatever area they believe is hot.

venture capitalists are the only source of money for well-funded startups like Uber, at least in the beginning before there is any significant customer base. Uber in particular is very unique even among startups because they require a good deal of cashflow in order to incentivize drivers, customers (in addition to possibly losing money on every ride sale they do to strangle the competition until the point where they are the only player in the market), and continue to expand to other geographic locations.

if an Uber or other company goes belly up, the VCs may or may not get their money back through the sale of the company's assets, which means the original investors like pension/mutual funds may or may not get their money back. in the case of Uber...there are basically no assets to speak of since the company doesn't own anything except the app and user data. 

so it's conceivable that retirees could lose money if an Uber type company goes under. however, if the pension fund or mutual fund is well-managed -- which they kind of have to be in order for all of the people running them to keep their jobs, but cases of incompetence do occur -- they will account for this type of risk and be able to remain solvent so the retirees don't lose money.

this kind of explains how it *could* happen, but since we don't know any of the exposure that an individual fund would have to Uber it's hard to know for sure. no financial manager worth their salt would have bet someone else's pension fund 100% on a startup though.",1489989858,df5v28a,t1_df5pwnc,technology,t5_2qh16,2017
350,cr0ft,"That will be nice, sometime 30-40 years from now when we can actually build cars with level 5 autonomy. 

People seem to think fully automated cars are just around the corner, but right now they can't handle roads without road markings, bad roads, rain, snow, fog... the list is long of things autonomous cars *can't* do. The head of Toyota's research himself said it would take decades. Because it's damned hard to take something designed for humans to operate and automate it. Just recently, Ubers tests with self-driving leaked - for the 20000 miles they tested, a human driver had to take over *every 0.8 miles*! Ridiculous.

Plus why would there be sleeper cars? Cars in general are incredibly shitty for going longer distances. They're ridiculously slow (just 200 km/h is enough speed that your life is in danger in case a tire blows, which it easily can.) If you're going so far you need to sleep to get there, you'd take something like a maglev train. With a sleeper car. Or napping car, since they go so fast you probably wouldn't have time for a full sleep.

Self-driving cars are a stupid dead end. What we need is to build rail-based solutions. They're child's play to automate (they already are ready to be deployed now!) and they're both faster, more resource efficient and safer.

351,McKingford,"&gt; Ride sharing is only going to grow

With very few barriers to entry. Uber's advantage was that it was first to market - in part because it simply decided to barge its way into the taxi industry despite its heavy regulation. So, ironically, Uber has blasted the doors open on the newly deregulated taxi industry, which allows any other competitor with a hailing app to start up.

Even with its advantage of being the first to market, Uber is hemorrhaging money - it loses more money with every shared ride. Its entire business premise was to stay afloat long enough until its self-driving cars came online, which would allow it to dispense with drivers. Now that it looks like it's likely to lose its lawsuit with Google, its entire business plan is in jeopardy.",1489991162,df5vldo,t1_df5ojpu,technology,t5_2qh16,2017
352,phynixx,"Human nature and the current trajectory of tech mostly. It's far from being a forgone conclusion but there are a few strong indicators.

When cars get to the point that we're not needed to supervise them, they'll also be at the point where they are far better drivers then us (the Google test cars apparently already are). ([Here's](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/03/18/should-we-outlaw-human-drivers-in-a-world-of-driverless-cars/?utm_term=.b67df17be563) an article that more eloquently covers many of my points with data and further sources.)

Unfortunately it looks like their public site with ongoing data isn't available anymore. But they've got a bunch of stuff on their self-driving cars [here](https://waymo.com/).)

From there, it's not much of a leap to see both insurance companies and legislators (if not the general public) calling for the safest possible option to be the only option allowed. I.e. how are they to explain to some family that their loved ones didn't have to die because someone feel asleep at the wheel / drove drink / made a mistake / etc. when a fully automated car could've completely prevented an accident. ([Here's](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/03/18/elon-musk-human-driven-cars-may-be-outlawed-because-theyre-too-dangerous/?utm_term=.716628f43c1a) Musk with a bit more elaboration).

Especially given many of the forecasted changes that'd come with full automation (there have been a bunch of predictions on how intersections &amp; such may change once human error is removed from the equation) ([A few](http://www.curbed.com/2016/9/6/12804434/driverless-cars-highways-roads-uber-google) points on some of the things that may change.)

([Separate](https://medium.com/emergent-future/self-driving-cars-are-going-to-change-everything-e6228c1f9d66#.bwiwyp4xm) related article.). With those charges in place, it might be even more dangerous to have a small percentage of human-driven cars on the road among all the high-performing automated cars.

A similar thing happened with firearms as society evolved to the point where you didn't need one to survive (for the most part). It used to be a given that everybody would have one &amp; know how to use it. Now in many places they're either outright banned, or you have to jump through a lot of hoops to have them. And, as I believe will happen with self-driven cars, having and using firearms is the exception, not the rule.


*TL;DR*: Full automation and the accompanying improved safety will mean human-driven cars represent an unnecessary risk to everyone else on the road. At that point it's not unreasonable to think that you'll need special permission &amp; possibly even a special area where you can self-drive.

Uber has been waging costly legal battles in an effort to prevent drivers from being classified as something other than independent contractors. This would force them to provide a level of financial investment (benefits, unemployment etc) that would result in a severe loss of profit and fundamentally change their business model. 

They also were seen as scabs in a recent protest by NYC cabbies at JFK airport. The CEO is also on a Trump economic advisory council. That last point in and of itself isn't a negative but given the current climate at the likely consumer base of Uber, it's not a big plus.  

Lastly, there is a strong backlash against them for their skirting of regulatory laws that taxi cabs have to deal with. While it can be argued that Taxis were rightfully undercut by better competition in the infrastructure of ride sharing, it happened/is happening due to an undue burden placed upon Taxis and not ridesharing. 

It's my understanding that some of these regulations were pushed forward initially by the taxi cab commissions due to too many drivers making it impossible to make a living as a cab driver. That said, it is a big roadblock that Uber et all have chosen to ignore through certain categorizations of their service.

421,[deleted],"Great comment. To expand on it a little bit:

Uber's business plan is twofold. One, start a ride sharing service and undercut all the competition by charge much less than is actually sustainable. The fee you pay as a rider only covers 40% of the cost of that ride. The long-term success of this plan is dependent on them successfully becoming a monopoly and thus being able to raise prices (without fear of competition) to the point that they actually cover costs. And two, as you said, reinvest all the money from the ride sharing service + venture capital into developing self-driving cars. The long-term success of this plan is dependent on them getting self-driving cars to market before they run out of investors and thus run out of money. They would presumably also be able to continue running their ride sharing service at similar prices if they no longer have to pay drivers.

Uber loses a couple billion dollars every year. They are not going to come close to achieving a monopoly in ride sharing because the public backlash against them means Lyft isn't close to death, taxis in some cities are still thriving, and some other cities are even developing smaller ride sharing services of their own. And they're not going to get self driving cars to market before they run out of money for, like, 18 different reasons, the biggest one probably being that they're so widely hated now that cities aren't going to bend over backwards to accommodate them anymore.

Because an autonomous car builder would, to challenge Uber, also have to build a ridesharing app, a whole ecosystem and userbase at the same time ... which is kinda like burning the candle at 4 ends.

Having AutoCar tech could of course be a money maker for Uber ... but only if the sell these cars ... which would kinda compete with their own business! Even having developed it all by themselves and using it to build their self driving fleet in and of itself gives them no advantage in the midterm, as even if they are the first, so many other companies will come out with their own versions.

432,dagoon79,"Your absolutely right, that irs write off is supposed to go back into your car. Most drivers don't ever factor that into their  maintenence of  the vehicle,  pretty much driving into the ground.  

If they did, between the per mile write off, commission rate of Uber/Lyft,  dead time and miles, a driver nets close to $0.06 to $0.07 per mile. 

The rates these TNC charge per mile, are at or close to rates of self driving cars at this very moment,  they've basically overshot the autonomous technology by pricing drivers pay by 15 to 20 years of when self driving cars will be ubiquitous, or even commercially ready to operate. 

For some reason these tnc don't realize the basic rule of business is to never underprice your product, because eventually the model will not be sustainable, and you've built up customers expectations on undervalued pricing. But, they are a little too naive in understanding this. 

Only reason I know this is Ive done pricing schemes for commercial transportation fleets, and seen them fail on smaller scales by trying to replicate Uber/Lyft frivolous spending. 

You basically are waiting for a magical unicorn, i.e. a monopoly or self driving cars, but they seem to not realize their coffers will run out sooner than later unless they start turning a profit.

Lyft has at least realized this, and does charge riders more, while taking less commission,  depending upon driver sign up date. 

Uber on the other hand has bottomed out the per mile rate to that of self driving cars, and that Google lawsuit, and just lack of understanding of pricing for commercial fleets is the tech bubble that's going to happen.

*Finally*. That's actually the first time you've said this, you kept dancing around the subject.

So hey, let's do this!

The thing you're asking for improvement on is called ""angular resolution"". We're basically taking a photo from the position of the car, using a fixed-zoom camera; the angular resolution tells us how much actual resolution we get at a specific distance. 

Conveniently, we can measure eyes the same way. Human vision has an angular resolution of about 0.025 degrees. So that's our target, more or less.

Now let's look at actual lidar devices. On the cheap end, the [Lidar-Lite 3](https://static.garmin.com/pumac/LIDAR_Lite_v3_Operation_Manual_and_Technical_Specifications.pdf) has a spread of about 0.5 degrees. If we're willing to pay four figures, the [Velodyne Puck](http://velodynelidar.com/docs/datasheet/63-9229_Rev-F_Puck%20_Spec%20Sheet_Web.pdf) is down to ""0.1 - 0.4 degrees"" - I'm willing to guess that this varies based on rotation rate, since the rotation rate range is also a factor of four, and it makes sense physically. The big boy in the room, the [HDL-64E](http://velodynelidar.com/docs/datasheet/63-9194%20Rev-E_HDL-64E_S3_Spec%20Sheet_Web.pdf), has a similar range, ""0.08 - 0.35 degrees"".

But that's compared to 20/20 vision. Fun fact: in California, it's legal to drive with 20/40 vision. That (conveniently) comes out to twice the angular spread; 0.05 degrees for a human.

The HDL-64E isn't legal resolution in California. But it's pretty close. Like . . . really close.

It'd be concerning if nobody were able to get better resolution. Thankfully, that's not the case. The [Riegl VZ-400](http://www.riegl.com/uploads/tx_pxpriegldownloads/10_DataSheet_VZ-400_2014-09-19.pdf) is capable of a rather impressive 0.35mrad. That's 0.02 degrees, just barely *better* than human-normal. Of course, it does so slowly, since it's designed for surveying and not realtime applications.

----

In some ways, a lot of this is totally irrelevant.

Modern automotive lidar is designed for 360 degree vision. But in a situation with a police officer trying to flag you down, you're not likely to need 360 degree vision. There's no real theoretical upper limit on lidar resolution; it's an engineering problem more than a science problem. The 360-degree lidar is expensive *because* it's 360-degree; there isn't much of a market for expensive realtime non-360-degree lidar, but if this proves necessary for self-driving cars, it seems unlikely that there's any major engineering blockages.

But it's even more irrelevant than that.

See, when we're talking lidar, we're talking depth. Do you want to try analyzing someone's hand signals based on the depths between their fingers? I wouldn't. I'd do it visually. Camera angular resolution depends *entirely* on the zoom lens applied; image recognition isn't a solved problem, but it's close enough that it's solved for this. We're even at the point where [computers can reliably recognize which objects are foreground and background](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03872.pdf). (This algorithm is currently way too slow to be done in realtime, note, but it's also currently implemented on the CPU and hasn't been optimized worth talking about.) There's a bunch of papers out there for combining visual data and lidar data - you can find 'em yourself, most likely, but if you insist I'll paste some links in.

So what we've got:

* Existing real-time lidar solutions are just barely below human requirements
* Existing not-real-time lidar solutions are well *above* human requirements
* There's no big market for high-end unidirectional realtime lidar, but if it turns out to be necessary, it can certainly be developed with little pain
* Cameras can be combined with lidar to fix a lot of problems, with a *ton* of research backing them already

I'm not saying it's solved yet. But I find it utterly baffling if you look at this - a bunch of technology which is a short stone's throw from being equivalent to human vision, and in many ways, already superior - and call it not-possible-to-make-good-enough.

----

Finally, all of this is *completely* irrelevant because [traffic cops use their entire arms](https://www.google.com/search?q=traffic+cop+signals&amp;tbm=isch), which, as you've acknowledged, we were able to recognize two years ago.

465,ZorbaTHut,"&gt; but you cannot extrapolate current tech to accomplish the wide range of situations on the road

Yeah you can.

I mean, look. I don't know for certain that NVidia will release a new graphics card in the year 2020. It's possible they're done, there's no GPU advances, that's it.

But it's very unlikely. GPU design hasn't hit a brick wall. It's hit a variety of interesting mushy walls, but nothing solid. It's not blocking on fundamental changes to our underlying model of physics, it's just blocking on people figuring out way to make transistors just a little bit smaller and deal with heat just a little bit more efficiently, and there's a bunch of weird technologies that are being worked on that might-or-might-not solve the problem, but there's enough of them that *some* are probably going to pan out. Even if they don't, simple process refinement can get us a good chunk of gains before we're done.

So, *even though* I can't prove this, I feel phenomenally safe suggesting that graphics cards have at least another few power-of-two multiples left in them, likely leading us up to at least the year 2020. Maybe further.

Meanwhile, take a look at LED efficiency. Cree released a bulb a while back with an efficiency of 303 lumens/watt. That's the highest released. Problem is, we can prove that, given our knowledge of physical laws, the maximum *theoretical* light output efficiency is 683 lumens/watt. Higher than that violates physics. Like, straight-up violates; not just ""we don't know how to do it"", but ""this is not possible unless something really phenomenal happens with our knowledge of the universe"".

And so I can say, again, very safely, that we will *not* be more than roughly doubling LED efficiency. Ever.

----

Lidar, in its basic form, is not complicated. You toss out a laser beam, you wait for the light to come back, you time how long it took. There's some complexity in that light takes time to travel, and so if you wait until the light has returned, you'll end up getting a limited number of samples; if you don't, your samples could conflict with each other. But there's a lot of tricks you can play with different frequencies of light to mitigate that, and in theory you can do stuff like concentrate samples on important areas. Then there's further issues with regards to how exactly you send light out in those patterns, and how exactly you record it coming back, given that you need to be moving your transmitter and receiver *very rapidly* and these are potentially delicate bits of equipment. But there don't seem to be any fundamental physical laws here preventing better resolution. Possibly *much* better resolution.

And that's why I feel safe saying that lidar hasn't hit a wall. Even though I don't know exactly what they're working on, I guarantee they're working on *something*, and given that the lidar industry is right now kind of synonymous with the self-driving-car industry, I imagine they're working on something useful for self-driving cars.

If SDCs need more accuracy, I see no reason more accuracy isn't possible.

And if your claim is ""you can't extrapolate current tech to the future"", my answer is ""yes I can, I've been doing it for well over a decade, mostly successfully, and you're going to need some serious evidence in order to counteract that"".

Like something parallel to theoretical efficiency of LED bulbs, for example. There's a lot of similar numbers out there; Carnot's theorem, Shannon limit, the Betz limit. These are hard limits. I don't know of any hard limit for lidar that we're anywhere near; if you do, I'd honestly love to hear it.",1490723462,dfita67,t1_dfis6tw,technology,t5_2qh16,2017

&gt; Tesla officials tell Daily Mail their vehicles do not come equipped with autonomous driving software, but rather with enhanced cruise control

Human driver either misinterpreted how the software works or was not paying attention. I've cited elsewhere in my statements about how the car is not completely autonomous and therefore the driver is at fault. However, this was not named an accident as no damage was done. It was merely a tap. Opening your car door and hitting another does more damage.

Can't find any reputable information about this. It's hard to get good news out of China since most of the news sources are not in English. As a result, it's hard to argue for or against here since there are no official statements from Tesla and I cannot find a single statement from a local government. If you can find one, I would be happy to read it.

Here is an important statement to keep in mind: You are ALWAYS in danger when you're either a passenger or are the driver of a vehicle. Your decisions or the decisions of the driver can put you in  a situation where you can die at any time. This is true when you're driving in a rural area, an urban area, or even if you're on a test track.

Driving is about minimizing those risks. You don't control what others do with their vehicles. You need to be on lookout when you're driving. If you make a decision without fully respecting your situation and put someone else's life at risk, then it is on you, not the other person.

This is driving common sense and a required understanding before someone gets in front of a wheel.

473,ButteredNani,"When I hear someone saying some jobs are immune to automation I think what is often ignored is that automation is not a binary thing where you either have humans or robots, as technology may simply put a dent in the required number of workers by taking over some of their tasks. Also one has to consider the whole ecosystem around the profession.

One of the mentioned examples were nurses, who would often be working at a hospital where you typically have staff for cleaning tasks and transportation of patients. These jobs are replaceable in the future by cleaning robots (automated laundry collection, floor washers etc.) and self-driving hospital beds.",1491133407,dfq428a,t1_dfpqacz,technology,t5_2qh16,2017

475,yupsate,"I honestly can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not.

If you're not, then to answer your question, we do have machines ready or soon to be ready (read: in the next few generations) to take over not only multiple industries, but all industries.

Humans think we're special and that there are things we can do that machines can't, but that's nonsense.  We're just neurons firing some relatively buggy code.

People tend to name jobs like doctor or lawyer as things we can't replace with machines, but these fields are already being taken over by machines and are actually some of the first fields that will be fully replaced.  Robot surgeons are [already better than humans](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601378/nimble-fingered-robot-outperforms-the-best-human-surgeons/) and they make diagnosis as well as or better than humans already (there are a ton of articles on this, but [here's one where machines made the same diagnosis as a human 99% of the time in 1000 patients](https://futurism.com/ibms-watson-ai-recommends-same-treatment-as-doctors-in-99-of-cancer-cases/)).  [Here's some thoughts from the legal field on how lawyers are being phased out slowly](http://law.queensu.ca/how-will-artificial-intelligence-affect-legal-profession-next-decade).  There are a ton of those articles out there as well.

Let me ask you instead, what job cannot be done better by a machine?

In a computer science ethics class I took while I was at university we discussed this, and the only real sticking point we had was whether or not humans would allow machines to entirely replace their government and make their laws and regulations for them.  Eventually this just turned into a discussion of how long it will take.

The reality is that humans are pretty shit at governing and deciding what's best for us.  Individually we're all fallible, and there are way too many of us to come up with ideal systems that wouldn't be too confusing to deduce let alone govern over.  But a machine could do it.

It can be hard for us to think this would happen, but change like this is always about two generations away.

As an example, people will resist self driving cars.  There will be an adoption generation where people start using them and other people start seeing the benefit but say stupid shit like ""nah, I like driving my own car"" despite the fact that terrible human drivers (read: all human drivers) make traffic and accidents and death, then there will be the majority generation where most people use automated vehicles and people who don't are considered behind the times grognards, and finally there will be a generation where the idea of driving your own car seems idiotic and something your grandpa had to do because they lived in the ""olden days"".

We will get there with machines as well.  In every field.  They will be better doctors, lawyers, scientists, prostitutes (seems like a joke, but it's not!), mayors, presidents, businessmen, writers, musicians, artists, whatever you can think of.

We may end up with humans in some of the artistic fields (""I like human art. I know it's not traditionally as 'good', but I think there's a certain simplicity to it"") and athletics (machines will be better athletes, but it's probably not interesting watching a bunch of perfect machines play each other, though the knowledge that they exist may put a damper on watching humans essentially fumble about in comparison), but pretty much all work can be taken away.

This is exciting and not defeating.  What are we without work?  How do we define humanity when we are not our job?  That's the next frontier.

As for the power sources bit of your question, Google the topics of renewable energy and increased battery efficiency.  Again, no one is saying this stuff is happening today.  Even the article only talks about 15 years from now.

Anyway, just give in to your robot overlords now to save yourself a struggle.  I'm totally not a robot since I subscribe to /r/totallynotrobots.

Also, this all assumes we don't wipe ourselves out before the machines can fix us.  If that's the case, don't worry about it.",1491151954,dfqe9wv,t1_dfqasef,technology,t5_2qh16,2017

*The article uses level 4 autonomy as the their benchmark for self driving. ""Level 4 autonomy refers to cars that can drive themselves without any human intervention, but only in certain geographic regions.""* 

*""Companies on the the Leadership Grid were assessed on 10 criteria: vision; go-to market strategy; partners; production strategy; technology; product capability; sales, marketing &amp; distribution; product quality and reliability; product portfolio; staying power. The companies were then given an overall score out of 100 based on their performance in each category.""*

**Ford:**

""The Detroit-based automaker aims to roll out a fleet of driverless vehicles in a ride-hailing or -sharing service in 2021. Ford is trippling the size of its autonomous test fleet to 100 cars this year, which are currently being tested in Arizona, Michigan, and California.

""What we have said is, we may not be the first, but when we do, it will be true to our brand, which means accessibility,"" Ford CEO Mark Fields told Business Insider in March 2016. ""We want to make sure it's available to everyone, and not just folks who can afford luxury cars.""

Ford has been pursuing autonomous vehicles since it entered the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005.

Ford and Baidu invested $150 million in Velodyne, a lidar manufacturer, in 2016. In February, Ford invested $1 billion (to be spread out over 5 years) in Argo AI, a secretive artificial intelligence startup based in Pittsburgh, to aid its autonomous car efforts.

Navigant Research gave Ford an overall score of 85 out of a possible 100.""

**7) Waymo**

""Since launching in 2009 as Google's self-driving-car project, Waymo's cars have driven over 2 million miles autonomously. 

Waymo has partnered with Fiat Chrysler and there are reports that the two will launch a robot taxi service by the end of 2017. The company is also building all of its hardware in-house, allowing it to slash the price of its lidar system by 90%, Waymo says. Lidar is notoriously expensive and high-end systems can cost as much as $75,000 a pop.

Waymo doesn't intend to build vehicles, but to provide its autonomous platform to other companies through partnerships.

Navigant Research gave Waymo an overall score of 73.4 out of a possible 100. That's the same score as Volvo, but Waymo edged out Volvo in execution.""

**12) Tesla**

""That's right, Tesla didn't make the top 10 in Navigant's report.

Although Tesla's self-driving features have come a long way, Navigant said there were reasons to doubt the automaker's ability to achieve Level 4 autonomy.

Tesla cars are currently being built with new hardware that will improve Tesla Autopilot, renaming the system Autopilot 2, and set the foundation for full autonomy. A Tesla will drive itself from Los Angeles to New York before the end of 2017 to demonstrate the technology.

Crash rates for Tesla cars have plummeted 40% since Autopilot was first installed in 2015.

But Navigant wrote in its report that Tesla's Autopilot system has faced its challenges, including a fatal accident in May while the system was activated. The National Highway Traffic Safety administration said Autopilot was not at fault because the driver had ample time to intervene and prevent the accident, but as the Navigant report notes, there's a history of drivers misusing Autopilot and engaging in other tasks while it's on.

Navigant also wrote it's skeptical Tesla will achieve full Level 4 autonomy without embracing lidar technology, a sensor that shoots lasers so cars can detect obstacles.

Navigant Research gave Tesla an overall score of 64.5 out of a possible 100.""",1491252704,dfsbh9w,t3_639h02,technology,t5_2qh16,2017

&gt;Most important, the software industry has for decades disclaimed liability for the harm when its products go wrong. Such an approach has its benefits. Silicon Valley’s fruitful “go fast and break things” style of innovation is possible only if firms have relatively free rein to put out new products while they still need perfecting. But this point will soon be moot. As computers spread to products covered by established liability arrangements, such as cars or domestic goods, the industry’s disclaimers will increasingly butt up against existing laws.

&gt;Firms should recognise that, if the courts do not force the liability issue, public opinion will. Many computer-security experts draw comparisons to the American car industry in the 1960s, which had ignored safety for decades. In 1965 Ralph Nader published “Unsafe at Any Speed”, a bestselling book that exposed and excoriated the industry’s lax attitude. The following year the government came down hard with rules on seat belts, headrests and the like. Now imagine the clamour for legislation after the first child fatality involving self-driving cars.

In short as software use expands so will demands that it be safer and less prone to breaking. If software firms won't do it, the gov't will force them to.

In the same sense that SpaceX can make a decent amount of money on government contracts launching satellites and supplies into space rather than making money on the dream to go to Mars.

I think the Boring company could make the bulk of its return on becoming a standardized solution for running new utilities underneath cities. It's a much higher volume market in the hyper loop could ever be.

Either way though you're looking at a company that's going to be constantly restricted by zoning laws, and that's a very very annoying thing to have in your way. When people find out they have leverage against your company they're going to start asking for compensation, because that's what people do.

You have to start greasing all the palms to get big projects that cross multiple district and states. I'm not sure that part is going to be much fun for Elon. 

Another use should be to start mining hard to access resources so that you can change resource distribution versus the current Global Norm if necessary, aka resource sourcing diversity. In other words you can use robotic boring to potentially unlocked otherwise unmineable resources and you can Target the resources that have the most impact on the global market to impact prices, much like how shall oil has created a oil sourcing diversity and that additional Source has driven the entire Market down even though that additional source is only a fraction of the market. Simply knowing that there is no shortage of a commodity can entirely change its price in the global market. Mining is far less restrictive than infrastructure and Transit projects. 

If Elon wants to change the world he needs to secure better funding and the way to do that is to create high-volume markets for useful consumer and Industrial robotics. This way he is no longer limited so much by his capital and need for investors or government funding, not that there's anything wrong with Government funding or investors, other than it can be a slow and distracting process. 

The world seriously needs robots that can do laundry and do dishes and clean floors and other basic repetitive tasks; I personally think we have the technology to make it happen and to make it commercially viable, but all we have are Roombas still.

Self-driving cars are cool, but a robot that did my household chores would be a lot more useful and I would get more total hours back from a machine like that then a self-driving car and it's a lot less dangerous too, thus easier to try new things. The robots would operate in a relatively confined environment compared to something like a self-driving car that has to operate everywhere and eventually runs into the situation where the last 10% of its programming become incredibly hard to profess because of the incredibly high amount of rare variables that it can run into.

The self driving tractor is cool, but its not really a big deal. Tractors are already large enough that the man hours required to run them is an insignificant factor compared to the overall revenue, despite thin margins.

And as for saving on the number of tractors... well a few, you can eliminate more of the smaller tractors, but overall your not really saving because harvest time is around the same time for the same crops. You can't harvest 1 wheat farm this month and another wheat farm next month if the second farm's wheat is going to start wilting and rotting by time you get done with the first. When shit is ready to harvest you usually need to harvest it right NOW. Farming profit margins are already razor thin as it is and even losing a partial percentage of your crop from waiting can result in a failing financials.

The problem is that, while people die in car crashes all the time, when someone dies to a self-driving car, it's front-page news.

100,BlueJimmyy,"This is exactly right. As much as we want to aim for 0 fatalities it is never going to happen.

The idea behind autonomous cars is that they are easier for the driver, and safer for everyone.

If someone steps out from behind an object that blocks line of sight in front of a self driving car that's doing a certain speed then it is never going to be able to prevent the collision and possible death, in the same way a car pulling out suddenly in front of autonomous car would not be possible to avoid.

The important aspect that needs to be realised is that in these situations if the vehicle and a human driver then the result would have been the same.

Autonomos cars have better reaction times, better all round spacial awareness and vision, and do not suffer from fatigue or distraction, but cannot stop a certain death in a situation it had no realistic control or fault over.

So long as we can reduce the number of fatalities then it is a positive. Pedestrians and over drivers may need to learn to adapt their road safety awareness for autonomous vehicles, but it should not put them at any greater risk.",1521482711,dvy9xgf,t1_dvy73wk,technology,t5_2qh16,2018

102,Kaarous,"&gt; As you hear a ton about this, remember that people die all the time from non-autonomous vehicles.

The problem with self driving cars is not whether or not they might or will kill/injure somebody.  They will, that is an inevitability.  

The problem is where liability will fall when it happens.",1521483196,dvyafww,t1_dvy73wk,technology,t5_2qh16,2018
103,godbottle,"Along the lines of the top comment you responded to, you seem to not understand that computers aren’t magic.  If the car is already moving and someone jumps in front of it there is a limit to what brakes and swerving can physically accomplish.  There are plenty of self driving cars already that can drive without an operator and far surpass human capability to stop accidents.  Even if there’s one situation like this per day (there’s not) it’s still orders of magnitude safer than the current situation of 100 auto accident deaths per day in the US (3300 per day worldwide).",1521483307,dvyak8j,t1_dvy7pc3,technology,t5_2qh16,2018

106,dreamoftheastronaut,"I live on the main autonomous loop in Tempe and constantly come in contact with the cars, including witnessing the aftermath of the accident that flipped a car last year. From what I've seen, they brake somewhat hesitantly and have difficulty reacting to sudden changes. The drivers also seem to have a tough time paying attention (which is fair - no stimulus or input for the entire shift). 

It definitely doesn't help that bike lanes and traffic engineering here are fucking garbage, but I was just yesterday watching a self-driving monitor fuck around while on the phone. 

Personally, I'm pretty wary of the software's capabilities, but if the driver isn't able to pay attention either, they need to be taken off the road. ",1521483988,dvybaln,t1_dvy9cot,technology,t5_2qh16,2018
107,HothHanSolo,"This isn't about facts. It's about perception. Uber has to be demonstrate the seriousness and gravity of this incident, and reassure the public they're doing everything they can to make their self-driving cars as safe as possible.

It's not about what the company is doing, but what the company is  signalling to the public.

I imagine they'll restart tests in a matter of weeks or months.",1521484065,dvybdnr,t1_dvyb3av,technology,t5_2qh16,2018

Yea... we don't know enough about robot performance in driving to know if they are safer than humans. We don't know if they're there yet, and we don't know if they will ever get there. Stopping a live program to do an RCCA (root cause corrective analysis) is absolutely the right thing to do. ",1521484251,dvybkp0,t1_dvyb3av,technology,t5_2qh16,2018
109,notmydirtyaccount,"Pedestrians and bicyclists are going to get killed by self driving cars.  The question is whether they are going to be more likely to be killed by self driving cars than they are to be killed by human driven cars.  It seems incredibly unlikely that technology will not be able to progress to the point where self driven cars are significantly safer for pedestrians and bicyclists.  Whether that is already the case is harder to tell.

This sort of thing is part of the inevitable process of progress.  It's certainly tragic for the individual but no more tragic than for the many other people injured or killed by human driven automobiles.  Hopefully it does not cause too much of a pushback in the wrong direction.

I do think that articles like this are being quite irresponsible when they don't make any mention or comparison with statistics of related accidents caused by human driven vehicles.",1521484334,dvybnx1,t3_85kytj,technology,t5_2qh16,2018

The driver is always responsible, but humans don't do well with limited stimuli/input for extended periods of time, so we run into the issue where the car will inevitably at some point cause accidents, and humans won't be ideal at stopping them all the time. The question is, do we give up on self driving cars entirely, or do we keep moving forward even if there will be accidents. Personally I'd love to see the numbers on how many miles it takes for the average human to kill someone while driving and how often accidents happen, and compare it to the collective miles driven by Uber's fleet and how many accidents humans had to avoid, to determine if these cars are safer or not, even today. I'd bet that if humans had been driving them, there would have been more than one fatality already, and that in spite of this accident, the car is still safer. For example currently over 3000 people die each day in car accidents. If we could extrapolate the Uber cars to all people immediately today, would we have more fewer, or the same number of deaths on average?

Why is this the question?  This is a stupid question.

Why don't they use shorter shifts for the operators?  Why don't they give longer breaks?  Why don't they have multiple people per car?  Why don't they have more operators, so that they can spread workload better?  Why don't they immediately fire people that aren't paying attention?  Do they have monitoring in the car and are ignoring it, or are they negligent in who they hire and/or how they perform?

You skipped right over the actual issue.  The question should not be ""do we want self driving cars or for people to not die,"" it should be ""how do we prevent these deaths?""",1521485224,dvycln9,t1_dvycebz,technology,t5_2qh16,2018

Currently we’re in a murky area where people are still asking “who” is “at fault” in that situation, but it should be fairly obvious that you can’t legally blame the consumer who just told the car where to go when the company’s code and hardware were controlling it.  100% autonomous is possible to market within the next ten years.

Especially with some of the attorney work out there, a learning algorithm could do the research work of many low-level associates and a lot of the bread and butter transactional work for solo practitioners, like wills and trusts and basic contracts. So long as a competent higher level attorney could review the algorithm's work and go do the in court appearance, it would likely be much more efficient than having a team of associates.

And the risk is so much less as well. If an algorithm messes up a court document, it's not great, but nobody dies. But with self driving cars, the risks are so high and many elderly simply won't trust a robot driving them around... even if that robot is a better driver than they are.

Meanwhile, people are already more than happy to pay one-tenth the price to websites like legal zoom to generate a whole slew of documents that don't necessarily fit their needs. A learning algorithm could replace legal zoom and many attorneys.

143,did_you_read_it,"well for one it is new and there is a lot of uncertainty about not whether autonomous cars *can* be safer or even *will* be safer but are they safer right now. 

at this point I don't think it is that click-baity   [this site](http://www.whosdrivingyou.org/rideshare-incidents#deaths) which seems to have an agenda against ride sharing and claims to be ""comprehensive"" lists deaths: weeding out murders and Lyft - Uber has 19 fatal human accidents over 4 years , which seems suspiciously low but at the moment don't have a better source. 

Considering they have thousands of drivers and billions of total miles driven that's a pretty low death rate. so let's fudge some fake numbers just to get an idea .  they report 160,000 drivers in the US. let's say that 100,000 of those are relatively full time and put 25,000 miles on their car a year.  that's 2.5 billion Uber miles driven a year , assuming all these accidents are in the us and are missreported by an order of magnitude (they probably aren't but we're just making stuff up to get a feel) that's ~190 human caused deaths since 2014. or one death every ~52 million miles driven. 


The self driving fleet is only 200 cars. Let's say they never stop and can drive 4 times as much as a human so 100,000 miles each. they have been operating a year so have a one in 20 million mile fatality rate. twice as deadly as the human counterparts (not bad though). 

Now granted a n N of 1 is too spurious to generate any real statistical data  and at this point we don't know if the car is really at fault but the exercise does give us an idea of how safe humans are as well as potentially how dangerous machines could be. it also gives us food for thought that in an increasingly automated world we won't really know what is safer until more people die.

Sensors detect there is an obstruction in the road and either swerve to avoid it, slow the car down or both. Same thing if the child follows the ball.

Self driving cars don't need to be perfect, they just need to be better than the majority of drivers, which isn't that hard.

&gt; The vehicle needs to slam on the brakes but the passenger is not paying attention..

Same thing that happens when a driver in a normal car slams on the breaks and the passenger isn't paying attention.

You could include a heating element near the sensor to melt the ice. And\Or use sensors that can ""see"" through ice (unlike humans machines aren't limited to visual light sensors).

I know if I or any of my family fell victim to an autonomous car in testing I'd sue for everything they got, and I'd sue the government for allowing it. That will inevitably come, and what then? How will Uber stand up to huge class action lawsuits from autonomous-car victims when just lying about emissions resulted in such a blow to VW? The only way is for the government to offer indemnity to self-driving car manufacturers. They must expect it because what manufacturer would willingly take on such direct liability for any collision occurring with their cars? 

They aren't at a stage for real-world testing and they should all be operating on private roads. They have the money to construct an elaborate infrastructure to simulate basically every foreseeable situation instead of conducting dangerous real-world testing. Heck the government should not only make that mandatory but also set that up so they can fully regulate and ensure the various companies meet all desired performance standards.

207,[deleted],"We’re kind of in uncharted territory here though, aren’t we? I agree technology can develop quickly, but we haven’t collected nearly enough data to even accurately assess how safe these systems are or not yet. We rate pedestrian fatalities on a 100 million mile basis, and Uber has only driven 2-3 million miles (below). In order to even be able to declare these systems as “safe” or “unsafe” with any degree of confidence, we need wayyyyy more data than we currently have. 

That said I think the promise in self driving cars is that they have the power to learn from accidents. That’s something that human drivers are nearly incapable of doing. 

Also I think your definition of “very close” is even too long term from what some companies are pitching. GM is claiming they’ll have a fully autonomous ride hailing service in 2019. That claim seems a little dubious after today. 

I think society just needs to decide on if they want this technology on the road without being fully proven to be safe (with the caveat that it can learn from its mistakes), or keep it off the road until sufficient proof exists demonstrating its safety.

we are told that the person walked from the center median. but the car is damaged right side. so the person has been walking quite a lot without being picked up by the sensors to be in that position. there are no sign of braking according the report and the driver was, of course, distracted, since there aren't visual obstacles to the center median and he reported to have noticed the collision only after it happened

229,WolfThawra,"Thanks! Yeah I don't know, it does seem a bit weird. Generally: 

&gt; found the Uber car was driving at 38 mph in a 35 mph zone and did not attempt to brake. Herzberg is said to have abruptly walked from a center median into a lane with traffic.

... why is it driving too fast at all? I mean yeah, apparently those 3mph would barely get you fined (according to some other comments in this thread), but still, one would think sticking 100% to the speed limit is not only a very good idea in this 'testing stage', it should also be really really simple to implement?

And how bloody quickly can she possibly have shot out into the road for the car to have no reaction at all? So doing some quick calculations, if she was going at 5km/h, [this image](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/19/uber-self-driving-car-kills-woman-arizona-tempe#img-2) indicates she would have had to cross about 2m of open space before being in the path of the vehicle even if the car was almost hugging the kerb (... and that's not good driving either). 2m take you about 1.5s at that speed, how can the car possibly not react within that time frame? A human would be faster... even if you say she was jogging at 10 km/h and it was only 1m, it's still 0.36s to react.

230,KAp3,"I didn't argue for the conclusion that self driving cars are ready for mass deployment.  I was simply pointing out some of the specious reasoning used in their 'argument'.

It is quite possible to agree with an arguments conclusion while still recognizing that the argument presented to arrive at that conclusion is fallacious.

Lives are put at risk by transportation generally, to set 0 accident fatalities as the standard that self driving cars must achieve in order for commercial deployment is absurd on it's face considering that the number of fatalities annually from traffic related causes in the US alone since automobile use became wide spread has been in the tens of thousands.

This very case is an instance where there was a driver in the car, who also failed to prevent the accident, if a human driver can override the automated system I don't really understand how you find the situation any more insane than if the same driver where driving an ordinary car.

231,cshultz02,Agree completely highway driving is most of my commute and is relatively mind numbing. as for dedicated lanes my idea would be to convert the leftmost lane on larger highways to autonomous only and maybe have shared autonomous elsewhere (requires a % of adoption before a lane could be feasibly autonomous only). Whole concept being to reduce the amount of variables the car will have to account for as adoption rises. Those dedicated lanes would be great during rush hour for instance and people seeing that would only increase adoption rate and safety of these cars as time goes on. I think if nothing else all cars should have something that lets autonomous cars know they are there and communicate whether they are self driving or not.,1521548623,dvznarn,t1_dvz9una,technology,t5_2qh16,2018
232,notreallyhereforthis,"&gt; Yeah, but that's inappropriately binary thinking. 

Indeed, you've identified the point. As you say, some people will get hit no matter the driver. 

&gt;  There is not a death penalty for jaywalking

You identified one issue is what is ""safe enough"", and you are correct, the question isn't whether cars hit people, the question is one of fault and expectations. With a person driving, if a pedestrian in the dark, at a random part of the road, in dark clothing, runs in front of a car at speed and is hit, the fault isn't in the driver, that was safe enough by most people's expectations, the fault was in the pedestrian. Fault for a pedestrian is mostly determined by whether or not the pedestrian was in a cross walk and if it was reasonable to assume a driver could see and react in time. With tech though, such a simple assessment we normally make is compounded by inappropriate expectations. This is only a story because the average person thinks it is somehow worse if tech kills someone rather than a person. If a drunk driver hit the pedestrian in a cross walk in broad daylight, it would barely get mention. But since the tech cannot be served with justice, cannot be morally responsible for actions, people get upset. As if throwing a drunk in jail for a year will assist with the dead pedestrian somehow. In the same way shutting down the self-driving program for a while will make people feel better. People will get hit, people will die, drivers kill 30,000 people a year, hard to imagine tech will make that worse.

Fuck yes.

I think the vast majority of people actually don't have the required skill to drive and should never touch a steering wheel.

Just like most people aren't cut out to perform open heart surgery, most people aren't capable of paying attention while driving.

Drivers licenses should be 10X's harder to get and the penalties for breaking road rules should be 10X's harsher.

Anyone with a basic understanding of human psychology could tell you having a driver be in the car ""just in case"" is beyond stupid.

Humans get bored and complacent. No shit a human wasn't going to stop the car in time after spending the past few hours bored shitless behind the wheel of a self driving car.

Anyone with an ounce of common sense could have told you that this was a disaster waiting to happen. The fact it was legal to begin with is mind blowing to me.

Fuck, I don't even like the fact that cars come with cruise control these days. If you can't keep a steady speed on the highway you don't belong on the freakin' road. Somehow I've managed 12+ hour drives and kept within 5kmph of the speed limit 99.9% of the time in a 2002 Corolla which didn't even feature ABS and that was shortly after getting my license, yet most drivers on the road can't even keep within 10kmph of the posted speed limit EVER.

So yeah, the more driver aids you give drivers (lane assist, adaptive cruise control, automatic transmission, etc) are just a good way to make drivers even less aware of WTF they're doing - which is piloting a 2 tonne death mobile at over 100kmph inches away from other cars on the highway.",1521552653,dvzqdu6,t1_dvzmvg9,technology,t5_2qh16,2018

Turning across traffic can be impossible, especially in busy cities. It is entirely reasonable to wait a certain period of time before giving up and forcing traffic to give way. I've been behind drivers who refused to do it, and they ended up getting honked by the traffic building up behind us.

I regularly cut across forcing other drivers to slow down, and 1 in 10 times will get honked at because the oncoming driver is an impatient douche. I'm assuming 1 in 1000 will cause an accident (I've never been hit).

In a world of self-driving cars, this interaction needs to be modelled.  We can't just say ""she was wrong, fuck her"".

However I also blame Uber/the car for not sensing the obstacle and avoiding or stopping. The car, so the authorities have said, didn’t brake before impact. These sensors are designed to “see” what humans can’t regardless of time of day. It’s troubling to me that it obviously failed and she wasn’t appearing from the bushes suddenly but had already crossed an entire lane, meaning there should’ve been even additional time for the sensors to pick up the obstacle from further away. My only thought to it failing to see her would be a hill where the car suddenly crests over and she was there or dangerous intersection but it seems to be a pretty flat area. Finally, the driver I don’t know if he’s on a phone or looking at a computer for data. If it’s a computer for data that’s allowed then that seems dangerous and I blame Uber for poor practices, but to use a phone while behind the wheel of a vehicle is reckless. He’s obviously there for a reason, and his eyes should not be off the road that often or that long. Granted, again, the biker was not in a crosswalk and hard to see but if he was using a phone he definitely needs ticketed for distracted driving. He’s at work and people’s lives are literally in these drivers hands to take over at a seconds notice and this should be a learning lesson for other self driving car companies and drivers that technology isn’t perfect and people suck at following laws and rules of the road.

278,ckwing,"&gt;It is important to put the blame where the blame goes: Uber's self driving AI.

Yeah but they're beta testing it. You're blaming beta software for having bugs?

The blame goes to the human driver and possibly to the woman crossing the street, who from the video appears to have not been looking in the direction of oncoming traffic.

If it was not possible for the human driver to avoid the pedestrian (and it is not clear from the video whether this is the case or not primarily because the video does not appear to be an accurate representation of the light/visibility levels), then this was just a regular car accident not very different from one not involving a self-driving car.",1521701123,dw3dipg,t1_dw2x5yg,technology,t5_2qh16,2018
279,ckwing,"&gt;Humans are human. We will pay attention as required. If 99%of the time our attention isn't needed, then we won't pay attention 99% of the time. The chances of us paying attention during the time it is needed becomes about 0.01%. 

I agree with your overall post, but just to quibble, the behavior you're describing is true for regular human drivers. However, in the case of safety drivers for self-driving cars, staying on high alert despite the 99% safety probability is literally their job.

To draw an analogy, a bodyguard or secret service agent is paid to stay on high alert and presume at any moment someone might try to attack or shoot their client. Even though 99.9999% of the time no attack will occur, their job is to prepare for imminent attack at any moment. A complacent bodyguard could get their client killed.

Now, is being a safety driver and rising to the level of alertness I described easy? No. Perhaps we're too lax on who we hire as safety drivers. But it IS their job to be alert where normal drivers would not.

But overall I think we shouldn't get too bent out of shape, I frankly am quite impressed that there's been so few accidents and fatalitiesi from all the self driving car tests. In my mind it's an excellent track record.",1521701632,dw3dqx1,t1_dw2ycsz,technology,t5_2qh16,2018

Also, the car didn't stop. It didn't try to stop. It kept going afterwards. It's not a matter of 'the car didn't detect it until the last second', it didn't even detect it when the victim was 1) visible under the street light according to this exterior camera 2) right in front of the array of sensors.  

A human driver would have seen the biker before and slowed down, not hitting them at all. An incompetent human driver would have seem them not as fast, at least slowing down before hitting them most likely not killing them. An object moved in front of a self-driving car equipped with lidar and radar and the car didn't even try to avoid it, it didn't even detect it in the first place. That is a MASSIVE issue.

If on average they are the same, and we know, for instance, that cars don't get drunk, then logic says that self-driving cars must make some *other* types of mistakes that humans don't normally make.

This recent crash is a perfect example of that. Humans could easily spot that this portion of road wasn't an actual road or band. But none of the Tesla cars could see that.

This is just *one* of the reasons why self-driving cars must be *orders of magnitude* better than human drivers for them to be *accepted by society*. They can't be ""just as good"" or ""50% better"" or even ""100% better"". That's still too small of a difference compared to an *average driver*. And remember, close 50% of the drivers are better drivers than the ""average driver"" (statistically), and a good portion of those are *way better* drivers.

Self-driving cars need to be *way better* than the *best human drivers*. I don't think society will accept anything less.

And remember when car companies show you their ""driving performance"", they are comparing a very limited set of data with only a limited number of *edge cases* (of which there could be millions out there in the world) to driving performance of humans across the entire US or the whole planet.

454,EaterOfSteaks,"Imagine this future: hundreds of eight legged daddy long legs looking robots, with their relatively tiny bodies suspended 5 meters up, pick their way across a field, identifying targets, swooping in low, and executing them with a pneumatically driven steel spike. When they've crossed the field, every possible target lays broken and dying in their wake. And that's how we deliver organic, non-gmo, pesticide-free, herbicide-free produce at such low low prices! With giant spider drones to eliminate weeds and laser wielding quad-copters eliminating harmful pests while leaving bees and beneficial insects alone, the yields are higher, and the environmental impact is vastly reduced. 


That's a potential future that ubiquitous AI and robots could usher in, but it doesn't take a leading AI researcher to know that that technology can easily be repurposed to build killer robots. Technically, right now there's an arms race among automotive and tech companies to build artificial intelligences that can differentiate between targets at high speed and ""deal with them"" appropriately. ""Little girl identified on curb, apply brakes, be prepared for unpredictable behavior."" ""Object identified as plastic bag, acceptable casualty, do not alter course."" I'm excited about self-driving cars being able to drive me across the country while I nap and watch movies, but if we can build AIs that can drive millions of miles, knowing how to deal with every object they come across at 120 mph, that technology is going to find military applications. 


In the event of a future drone-based conflict, it's going to be all about response time. Your drone has to send messages to a warehouse in Nevada, and wait for a response from a human operator, it's going to lose to an autonomous opponent every single time. We keep people from carrying a water bottle through security at the airport just to feel safe, but we're not going to implement the available technology in our military hardware out of principle? Why even have a military that can't win conflicts? To me it seems irresponsible not to build killer robots if you have an obligation to protect your people. 


On the other hand, killer robots really hands a lot of power over to capital. It used to be that you had to at least have the consent of a bunch of people with guns to oppress a populace. In the future some jerk with a few billion dollars can control a country with an off the shelf robot army that he buys from some shady Erik Prince type guy. Even if every major government refuses to build a robot army, while secretly developing the capability to do so if the need arises, the commercial artificial intelligence will probably hit a point where Erik Prince style jerks will still be able to cobble together robot armies for immoral despots. 


In the future, we will have killer robots. I'd rather that we proactively planned for that future, instead of letting the least moral parts of our society define what a future of killer robots is going to look like.

455,SouthernShao,"Intellectual and cultural development is important, but when talking about a financial investment for your own future, and what you can provide that other individuals will value from a sense of whether or not they will be inclined to pay you for your knowledge, there's a very important and distinct differentiation there.

Every business owner is looking for particular skills. If you don't have skills that most business owners are looking for, nobody is going to be inclined to hire you. Generally, it's self-evident that the more valuable your skills are, the rarer they are, thus the higher paid you'll be. This isn't absolute, but it is very true when you look at it from a holistic perspective.

If you're going to go to university and end up with a ""worthless"" degree, it's worthless insofar as to be something very few businesses will be willing to pay you for. We can accurately analyze which skills are important, and those skills change over time. In the US, we want semi drivers, but with automated, self-driving cars just around the corner, it's very possible that we will very soon no longer need that. Do we need anesthesiologists? A company not that long ago created a machine that was tested as being approximately 50% cheaper than an average anesthesiologist, while being more accurate than a human, and posing fewer health risks due to the lack of human error.

In fact, an anesthesiologist world union (I don't know what they call themselves) lobbied to the UN to ban the production of this machine, out of fear that it would jeopardize the jobs of said individuals (and it would).

Why would you hire such a person at such a pay if you can purchase a machine that is not only more efficient, but cheaper, and that pose fewer health risks to people? It would be like paying someone to mow your lawn with a scissors, when they want 10 dollars an hour to do so, but it will take them 12 hours to mow your lawn, when your next door neighbor has a riding lawn mower who could do it in 20 minutes.

It's extremely important to realize what the value of your labor is. What do YOU bring to a business? Being driven, or a quick-learner just isn't enough. LOTS of people are those things. So what makes you stand out that will give a business an advantage over hiring you over somebody else?

And your idea that you're asking for a full value of labor, I find that idea completely silly, with respect. You are getting the full value of your labor. The full value of your labor is whatever somebody else will pay for it. Think of it in terms of the value of a good or service. What IS the value of a good or service? Well that's actually a very simply question to answer: The value of a good or service is whatever somebody will pay for it.

So if you apply to 100 businesses and the most any of them will pay you is ""X"", then the value of your labor is ""X"". It isn't ""X+100"", because you want it to be, and it isn't ""X+100"" because the company makes that +100 additionally by having you in their employ.

When you took the job, you told this business that you will work for them for what they are willing to pay you, and the business told you that they will let you work for them, above everybody else that applied for that position, for what they are willing to pay you. It's a 100% consensual agreement. It's like if I sold you a car for $5,000. You didn't get ripped off. I didn't get ripped off. I offered you a trade, set the price (or we bartered), and we came to an agreement. If you don't like the agreement, don't buy the car, or barter!

And the argument that some people don't have a choice because they either have to take that payment or not have a job; well, ya? What's your point? If your labor value is extremely high, your bartering power is going to be extremely high. If you're a master computer programmer that can code elaborately intricate and complex systems, with 20 years experience in such environments, the value of your labor is probably going to be HUGE. Every company searching for such an individual will want you, and will probably offer you the moon to come work for them. But if you're fresh out of university with a degree in Liberal Arts and no experience doing pretty much anything, what can you hope to do? There will be people with a high school diploma that may have taught themselves valuable skills that you won't have. Maybe in MySQL, PHP+HTML, Excel scripting, Project Management, or a slew of other possibilities.

I've met tons of people who have crummy jobs and come equipped with crummy degrees who never pushed themselves to enhance their value beyond their degree. I know people with a degree in theater, or a degree in religious studies, all who make nothing. They also have no redeemable skills that most businesses are looking for. It isn't the fault of the businesses to not want to hire them, it's their fault for making poor choices in how they've spent their time.

And how do you actually quantify that your value is greater than what a business is willing to pay you? How do you get to set your own value? I wish I could do that. I want a million a year because I'm a really special, smart guy. I think that it's unfair that I've worked with people half as hard working as I am who make the same pay. Life's unfair, so I demand that the government step in and force businesses to pay me even more.

483,SkittleInaBottle,"So late to the party, damn time zones.

Every time such an article comes up, I see most people cramping up. It's easy to equate ""half of banking jobs being wiped out"" with ""those people won't have a job ever again"".
But job destruction is actually a vital part of the way an economy works. Before the industrial revolution, you needed about 90% of people producing food. Today I believe this number is 3% in the U.S. 

Does this mean that farmers at the time should have fought for universal income ? (had they had the opportunity and political influence)
Same thing happened with the rise of automation and the internet, this time to manufacturing jobs. The very same job that destroyed agricultural jobs in the first place.

So today those manufacturing jobs account for 8% of the workforce.

Fast forwarding to today. Where tertiary jobs are getting hit by I.A, the new automation, or the new industrial revolution.

Just like 100 and 200 years ago, there is a clear dominating sector. It used to be agriculture, then manufacturing. Today tertiary activities account for 80% of the workforce.

If innovation follows its current trend, it will probably be down to 5-10% within the next 4-5 decades. Does this mean those people will be eradicated from the workforce ? Condemned to everlasting unemployment, depression and death ? Probably not.

Just like agricultural workers massively moved into industrial production in the late 1800s, people will have to retrain themselves for whatever comes next.

Many people seem to think that nothing WILL be next, and envision a world where A.I is the only necessary input for production, with humans playing little, or, ultimately, no part.

While no one probably knows for sure, there is one thing we DO know : the limitless nature of human desire for a better life.

No one needs an Iphone, yet this product alone generate higher revenues than some country's entire GDP. When innovation drops prices and increases quality for existing goods so massively, incomes are liberated to be spent on new things.

Even when these new goods/services/??? do not exist yet, the availability of income to be spent creates a huge potential demand for any sort of innovation.

This potential demand in turns create a huge incentives for anyone with capital to invest massively in promising new ways to provide people with opportunities to spend this newly freed up income.

I'm confident people will not go unemployed anytime soon, because human desire will not fade out anytime soon.

Once A.I takes over most tertiary jobs, maybe the art industry will explode to an unprecedented degree. Incomes beeing freed up by 100$ Iphones and self-driving cars powered by solar energy (just a very unimaginative example) available for 15k, maybe owning art will become the new priority by which people evaluate each other.
Maybe this will become the new ""essential thing"", moving from our current ""communication is essential"" paradigm to a ""expression of creativity is essential"" paradigm (remember that 200 years ago, the paradigm was ""Food is essential"", we have come a long way). It would certainly be coherent with the Maslow paradigm, although I wouldn't necessarily consider this theory a reliable source for predicting human behavior.

Maybe art will not be the next industry around which our lives center, maybe this industry doesn't even exist yet. But human desire, and human incentives for production have always existed and are likely to fuel future industries in which human still play a part. Because the need for purpose and meaning also applies to all of us.

For all these reasons, I am confident (although certainly not certain) that humans still have a long future of employment ahead of themselves.",1524305007,dxq5ilh,t3_8drci8,technology,t5_2qh16,2018
484,2522Alpha,"The fatal flaw in your argument is that you've based it around machinery that still requires a worker to operate it. With the current level of automation, machine maintenance, cleaning, fault finding etc are still carried out by human workers. A modern car factory opening in a town would still create jobs with the current level of automation because technicians are always required with the current level of automation in production industries. 

Now imagine that automation progresses beyond this, where machines can carry out all their own diagnostics, repair work, routine maintenance etc without human involvement. Now those technicians are out of work as soon as the kinks and bugs are rooted out of the new automated systems. And as soon as that happens, every medium &amp; high volume manufacturer in the world would adopt those systems because they would be cheaper than training and paying human technicians. 

This level of automation could apply to every industry. Logistics is already automated to a degree, the only reason amazon keep so many warehouse workers is because they pay them awfully for the amount of work they have to do, making them cheaper than full automation. 

Automation is being developed within agriculture too, with GPS-guided combine harvesters and tractors hitting the market within the last 5 yeaes- however legislation demands that there has to be an operator in the cab. The same is happening to long haul trucking, and once self-driving systems are perfected then human truckers will become obsolete.

Okay, what standard are you measuring against?

If we're measuring by demand and potential sales, that doesn't seem to hold up. Current customers haven't canceled pre-orders en mass over delays in production. The Model S and Model X are also selling well with more people wanting them than can afford them. That suggests Tesla would be able to accept more pre-oreders if it made them available or able to sell Model 3s on the market if they were available. That is the most important thing for investors as they watch the company sorting out delays. As levels rise, do sales rise to match? For now, yes, every single car that can be sold is already sold.

&gt; SpaceX is 99% NASA

NASA is one of Space X's biggest customers because they do a lot of launches into orbit. If you look at the [development history of their SpaceX engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_rocket_engine_family), you won't see a NASA engineering partnership. Those were built, tested, and similar by Space X and Musk. NASA is a customer that buys SpaceX products rather than the government building SpaceX's products then buying them. 

The US Air Force does support [some development financially](http://spacenews.com/air-force-and-aerojet-rocketdyne-renegotiating-ar1-agreement/), but it doesn't go to Space X. That was funded primarily with private venturecapital (with the rest being Musk's own money) rather than depending on the government like ULA does. If you wanted to say that ULA's efforts were 99% Air Force, I would agree as they used government money.

&gt; The U.S. Air Force and Aerojet Rocketdyne are working to revise an agreement to support development of the company’s AR1 rocket engine, as questions continue about the engine’s long-term future.

&gt; The hyperloop is just a scam

Musk released some engineering musings and other people ran with it. You can't hold him responsible for what engineers do with their time. Nobody should ever be held responsible for that even the engineers. 

&gt; Ever noticed that he's doing all this [...]?

Yeah, that is the whole point. He is doing it. The rockets launch and land. The self driving Tesla system can drive the car sometimes. The products exist on the market right now instead of 5 years from now. We can disagree over the specifics, but we agree to this point. You take issue with doing it using private investor money, but why? Why do you care what private citizens do with their money?

Shouldn't you be more concerned that the Air Force had an agreement to use public money to support ULA's development when SpaceX invested and built their own using private money? ",1524418627,dxscp9k,t1_dxsbtui,technology,t5_2qh16,2018

499,3trip,"good points, but the entire transportation industry will not be instantly replaced overnight, nor will any other industry. it will take many years, over a decade by my estimates for the entire industry in the US to switch after self driving becomes viable.

Reduced wages, inequality and instability are effected by politics (internal and external) markets (internal and external) and the corruption thereof.

let me give you two long winded examples of corruption causing our economic problems.

A good example of domestic corruption would be the wall street bailouts, we should of at minimum let the market correction kill off the idiotic bloated businesses that caused the sub prime mortgage crisis, those companies should of been forced to either reform or be replaced. At best we could of prosecuted and made an example out of them.

yet these companies still exist and those massive dinosaurs are a burden to the economic gene pool, slowing the pace of economic growth, on top of the money directly lost by the bad mortgages they sold and the cost of the bailouts (paid for by the tax payers, who also paid for the stimulus)

another would be foreign trade imbalances.

Take china, there are handful of key issues behind our trade imbalance

import bans, China has banned, or put steep tariffs on the import of many US goods, the auto industry is a good example.

they manipulate their currency in order to obtain even greater advantage on foreign trade (at the cost of their populations prosperity) 

They have little to no interest in respecting our intellectual property rights (aka they steal our designs and hard work)

their workers have a much lower standard of living, with fewer social services, environmental regulations and taxes making them much more competitive to the cost of american labor.

lastly, the quality of their goods is often found lacking, though as of late there seems to be some improvement in this area.

many of these things we are not willing to compete with china over, for example, lower standards of living, or currency manipulation (well at least on their level(yes we are manipulating ours at the cost of our citizens well being too))  but one thing we could of easily done at any time was *change trading partners.

we could of gone to any third or second world nation, we could of gone to one willing to enforce our intellectual properties and not block import of our goods.*

instead we've stuck with the Chinese, and haven't even threatened to go shopping elsewhere to try and improve our situation. That there is some seriously messed up boot licking.

Care to guess how much the Chinese have been donating to and/or manipulating political campaigns in the US? 

the Chinese are not the only nation we have a trade imbalance with either, never mind the Russians!

In my book our current economic problems are not because of automation, but because of corruption/politics and market forces.
I say that if it weren't for innovation and automation, we'd be in a far worse economic state. Think of those nail salons, but with fewer patrons, because no american factory could compete with the third world without automation.",1524876396,dy3beoq,t1_dxt9kt0,technology,t5_2qh16,2018

In the self-driving future, a family of three having three one-person transport pods rather than one six-person SUV might be more desirable, and take up less space. 

It *is* also possible that the same family would be able to rely on just one one-person pod, with some sort of SD-taxi filling the gaps where more than one person needs to be on the road at the same time, but the whole Vehicle-As-A-Service concept may indeed be beyond what the average person is willing to deal with.

43,BeingUnoffended,"First, that comment wasn’t directed at /u/laminar_flo, who was actually (if I’m not mistaken) taking the same stance I have. But I do stand by the statement: in these cases, the “subversive racism” argument, is baseless, low-resolution, and ignorant of the process of development.

Regardless, what you are seemingly talking about is inequity, not inequality – they’re not the same thing. And there is no objective evidence that unequal racial, sexual, and class representation across career fields has anything to do with the characteristics of work produced. If that were not the case, then where merit is subjugated by equity based recruiting we would expect the quality of work to increase as the male-to-female ratio approached 50:50. But that isn’t the case. And statistical evidence suggests that the differences in representations across careers can in almost every circumstance be attributed to the choices of the individuals in those industries.

 To address your citations directly: 

**Implementing Machine Learning in Health Care — Addressing Ethical Challenges**: This doesn’t actually claim to have found evidence of bias in machine learning related to the medical field. Rather, the paper discusses supposed racial biases in demonstrated in ML in other fields (i.e. self-driving cars) but does not address the cause of them. It assumes that bias is the most basal reason for the events – again, there is evidence to suggest this isn’t the case. And the authors discuss how to avoid similar outcomes when applying ML systems to the medical field.

**ADVANCES IN BIG DATA RESEARCH IN ECONOMICS**: This paper blatantly says that bias isn’t the problem, rather; that race is reconstructed by statistics – that is more-or-less the argument made in my post. That is to say, that because differences between subjects (see: /u/laminar_flo‘s example of mortgages) create trends in data, the outcomes complex systems produce as a function of that data might appear to be biased despite that not actually being the case. Further, they note: “strategy of blinding the algorithm to race inadvertently detracts from fairness.”. Despite this, they seem to still be placing equity above the accuracy of algorithms – which seems a bit contradictory, and more like advocacy than good science. 

The www.researchgate.net link keeps freezing on some infinity symbol logo. I’ll see if I can’t look at it later. Anyway, claiming that racism *must* be an issue because of the racial representation among developers, requires that you make an assumption about the biases (unconscious or otherwise) of those developers. Most ML work being done right now is happening in some of the most Liberal communities in the United States (San Francisco, Portland, Seattle etc.). The people doing this work are *highly* consciences of race, gender, sex, etc. And accusing them of being secretly racists, or unwilfully driven by racial bias is disparaging to the very people who are diligently trying to solve these issues. *that* is what is not helpful.

It's trying to predict what letter comes next. The metric is: did it predict the correct letter? So it doesn't need a human to classify anything, because the training data are just exerpts paired with the text that would follow them.

The analogy for a self-driving car would be giving the model 30 seconds of data (from every sensor), and asking it to predict the next 30 seconds of data (from every sensor).

That doesn't in and of itself generate a label that says ""human"" or ""truck"", but to do the task well, you need to be able to predict what that human-shaped or truck-shaped blobs of pixels will do next. You'll also need to learn to predict what will happen next to anything else the car sees: a ""loss function"" to do with predicting full-video output would penalize a model for not understanding even irrelevant things like how palm trees sway in the wind. A really, really good model along these lines would ""try"" to understand things like dancing well enough to guess what a person dancing on the side of the street would do...it might ""learn"" language just to predict how lips will move.

  This should scare everyone in my mind now I know during the Great Depression the world governments discussed cutting the full time work week from 40 hours to as low as 10.  The reason they didn’t do this was because idle hands would be problems for the governments ie protesting and rioting. 
   Without taxing these technologies no one will have any income the gap between super rich fee and everyone else will widen. 
   Just look at these self driving cars that are closer than most want to believe mid 2020 they will be the standard option when you go to get a car. Eventually they will and companies are already prepping the cars to be converted to to self driving. 
Bus drivers cabs trucking delivers for food all these jobs are going to be gone sooner than we’d like to believe. One of the biggest hold ups so far has been the 5G network it’s accurate to within a 1/4 in compared to 4g 60 foot diameter. Then all the info that can be transferred almost immediately. These self driving cars are happening they will also be givin us no choice about it. 
Now I know people will say forget that I’ll just drive around them etc. that’s fine but these on board computers are now the driver and that’s who gets the summons but the reality is cops will have fewer and fewer people to summons so 3 cars in a row completely stop at stop sign and you do a rolling stop that normally wouldn’t cause the cop to even blink because the other cars blew the stop completely. Cops will be forced to issue summons for the slightest infraction because these cars won’t break vehicle traffic laws nor will they park illegally either.

To open 1 door, the others have to be closed but on our touch screen all of the doors have shifted to end up being open even when they're closed because the sensors have failed in a lot of them so we cant even use the back or messenger areas. Another issue? The auto-stop causes the transmission to fail so we have to make sure the trucks stay on at all times.

Tesla doesn't sell self-driving cars yet, and their ""Autopilot"" feature is more like an enhanced version of the ""cruise control"" you find in many other car models.

136,zendeavor,"&gt;MySpace would like a word.

I don't understand what this is supposed to mean. MySpace could never dream of becoming the capitalist superpower that FaceBook has developed into, not when it was ""the next big thing"" and not now that it's been floundering for a decade as some shell of its former self.

&amp;#x200B;

In the context of the comment you reply to, it sounds like you call MySpace a competitor but this is less than laughable. Nothing on the planet comes within 10 magnitudes of FaceBook/Instagram, and I'd argue that WhatsApp is in the same position as a Facebook owned platform because the only thing that touches it has a uniquely Chinese demographic where the rest of the internet can't effectively reach.

&amp;#x200B;

So that leaves us in the position imposed by the prior comment; there's room for competition but users aren't leaving FB/IG/WA for competitors. They're just leaving. There isn't a viable competitor on the market, and to become one you need the resources of Google and Amazon, probably combined, just to get off the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing that is going to kill FB properties is FB itself. Nothing will ever overtake them, they will just die by not keeping up with new demographics and alienating existing users. MySpace came up as a first to market service, and was overtaken by FB due to missing a key demographic in college culture because MySpace had developed into its own counter-culture position that went against the mainstream. It wasn't necessarily their own mistake; the demographic they captured simply outgrew the service and moved on. Facebook is experiencing some of this as well since their strategy is not well-aligned with the current societal privacy/security/""stop selling us to other companies against our will"" mindset. However, it really isn't impacting the bottom line so much because FB diversified their portfolio with some powerful acquisitions.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, I don't understand your comment at all. Anti-trust hasn't slipped here. It's what prevents FB from even considering something like buying another social media service that aligns with what FB itself offers, or another social photo sharing service like Instagram, or to absorb another messaging service like WhatsApp. It doesn't, however, prevent them from attempting something like (as we enter an alternate dimension where this would ever be possible) buying out one or more of Alphabet's (Google) services. They can't buy/merge 500px because antitrust law would intervene due to their ownership of Instagram which is a directly competing service. They are welcome to explore self-driving automotive tech, VR hardware and applications, ride-sharing services etc etc to their hearts' content.

161,lookmeat,"Well yes and no. Right now we mostly have level 3 automation, this is the level where the car mostly drives itself but it needs a human at the wheel at any point. This level is already out there commercially, as in you can buy cars that mostly drive themselves, but still need you to do various turns, park, etc. You can integrate this with other self-driving systems to the point that you mostly are making choices, but not all of them. This is considered a ""level-3 automated vehicle"". You still need a driver at this point.

Now lets upgrade a level-3 vehicle, and add the ability to automatically recognize when it isn't capable of making the right choice (basically have it always know when a human driver is needed), then give it the ability to safely stop (park if needed and possible) at any situation. Then whenever any situation arises that you need a human, but a human driver isn't available you simply do a safe stop and park if possible. This is level-4. Generally you can have a level 4 care that is bound to certain geographies: a car that knows how to get on and off highways, but will not move through common streets on its own beyond finding the nearest parking; or a car that knows very well how to drive on a very limited space (say the city of San Francisco). Notice that level-4 vehicles can't take you everywhere, and have limitations for private use (that is it'll be a cool feature, but probably something that is only a luxury feature, because you won't be able to use it a lot of the time).

The general prediction is that by 2020 we will see the first reasonable level-4 cars. At least as far as I understand. It actually seems reasonable. They probably will be very constrained on where they can run. For SF most of the city could be run by level-4 vehicles, with anyone leaving the area getting a human driver. Just because we see the first ones, doesn't mean we will see them commonly. I suspect that only certain big cities will get self-driving cars, and most places will remain with mostly human-drivers. I may see that around 2030 many places will have autonomous vehicles, and we may start seeing the beginning of a car that can handle enough conditions to be level-5 (at which point it can driver through anything a human driver could do), I don't see it getting to level-6 (when it's always at least as good as the best human-driver could be) anytime before 2050 though.

This means that Uber will have its fleet be almost all human drivers until around 2030 (lets be conservative and make it 2035). But lets talk about Ubers strategy, and why it matters that this happens.

* Uber's model *currently* isn't viable (you can make cash of it long-term). Just like Amazon's aggressive prime model wasn't viable 10 years ago, but now is.
* Uber has been trying to keep costs as low as possible, but the aim isn't to make money, but to last long enough to the point you do. Reducing costs slows the bleeding down.
* Which is what the whole thing here is. Uber is trying to lower the costs as much as possible, and make the benefits as low. It may increase later on, but now it wants to keep things low.
    * This also works on the idea that as drivers leave you will replace them with automated-cars. Pay attention and notice that this cuts and issues will happen in cities were we will begin seeing automation happen first. CA cities are close to the company, and the state has legislation, so these will be the first. We may see this in other cities in states with legislation that is friendly. As you begin automating you want to only keep the best drivers, and ideally pay them less (maybe more per-mile or hour, but but less overall as they do less, more focused work).
* Around 2020, there will be a rush to get the first level-4 vehicles out there. I suspect that the biggest targets will be:
    * Downtown taxis in specific cities.
    * Trailers over highway systems (with a place where they transition to human-driven vehicles to go into cities) (there'll still be the need for guards, but they would be cheaper than an actual driver).
    * Food delivery in specific cities (related to the taxis).
* Uber's bet is that when this happens they will have a huge advantage, already having a lot of the logistics of handling a fleet, routing, picking people up, doing ride-sharing, etc. The only difference is that now they can get their own cars.
    * Moreover they have a backup system for cars that can't drive themselves.
    * Moreover the system they have managing drivers means they could delegate to external fleet owners that handle all the challenges of a local-fleet, with themselves getting a cut for being the middleman, which is a very convenient position.
* There's other players that are trying different strategies.
    * Tesla is betting on it being the common car seller for this situation. Electric cars are cheaper in maintenance and fuel costs in the long-run, the only issue is that limited charge holding means your driver has to be very aware of charge/fuel and where to go for recharges next, but this is trivial for a machine to do. Tesla is probably going for trailers before buses or anything else, because trailers could benefit from being able to drive 24/7 (instead of the limited hours that human drivers require) which means that this could result in decrease time-costs that offset any costs of new technology. Other car manufacturers are doing this. This is also why many manufacturers are planning to stop making Sedans for common users, they expect that cities and other areas where sedans make sense will get replaced by the many self-driving services available in the next 10 years.
     * Car-sharing services like Zip-car, Getaround, etc. will probably want to use self-driving cars that can move as needed. This lets you rent a car, drive it somewhere, then leave it and stop paying, the car would go to where demand requires it and look for parking itself (leaving the area all-together if it's too full). They are betting on a more casual case of self-driving vehicles but I have yet to hear of anyone betting on this at all. They have parking and the logistics of managing a distributed fleet already.
     * Waymo and the like are simply betting on the tech being useful and licensing working. They have a huge advantage and hope that no one will be able to effectively compete, allowing them to dominate the market. Basically they hope that all above will buy their tech and use it instead.
* Finally they don't need to be able to go fully automated soon. A gradual transition can allow them to keep costs low as things improve. They also already have (controversial) practice dealing with laws that stop them. They probably will push a lot of the legislation for self-driving cars world-wide.",1553551050,ejdeaw5,t1_ejcx5xm,technology,t5_2qh16,2019

198,glockenspielcello,"I agree with you in part. I didn't mean 'revolutionized AI' in the sense of 'created and actual AGI,' but rather 'revolutionized the field of computer science that has been branded AI' by creating paradigm-shifting technologies. Folks like Hinton, LeCun, Bengio, Schmidhuber etc. have all been responsible for making very significant technical advances to the field of AI by developing neural network training technologies (backprop, Hinton + co) and pioneering neural net architectures that underly most modern computer vision/audio processing/NLP applications (LeCun with ConvNets, Schmidhuber with LSTMs, etc.). While this isn't the same kind of revolution as AGI would be, it's the reason we have Google Translate, the beginnings of self-driving cars, automatic check deposits, and phones that can understand and interpret your spoken words.

On the other hand, all of these have very deep technical knowledge of 'AI' systems and their capabilities, and all of them are markedly skeptical of the fearmongering around supposed AI superintelligence. This is because they understand the limitations of these technologies, despite their successes. To quote Yann LeCun:

&gt;I keep repeating this whenever I talk to the public: we’re very far from building truly intelligent machines. All you’re seeing now — all these feats of AI like self-driving cars, interpreting medical images, beating the world champion at Go and so on — these are very narrow intelligences, and they’re really trained for a particular purpose. They’re situations where we can collect a lot of data.  
&gt;  
&gt;So for example, and I don’t want to minimize at all the engineering and research work done on AlphaGo by our friends at DeepMind, but when \[people interpret the development of AlphaGo\] as significant process towards general intelligence, it’s wrong. It just isn’t. it’s not because there’s a machine that can beat people at Go, there’ll be intelligent robots running round the streets. It doesn’t even help with that problem, it’s completely separate. Others may claim otherwise, but that’s my personal opinion.  
&gt;  
&gt;We’re very far from having machines that can learn the most basic things about the world in the way humans and animals can do. Like, yes, in particular areas machines have superhuman performance, but in terms of general intelligence we’re not even close to a rat. This makes a lot of questions people are asking themselves premature. . That’s not to say we shouldn’t think about them, but there’s no danger in the immediate or even medium term. There are real dangers in the department of AI, real risks, but they’re not Terminator scenarios.

And while I agree that automation has already caused big problems in manufacturing, with more problems to come, the 5 year timeline is definitely too ambitious.

As I wrote the other day in the Yang moneybomb thread:

At most within 5 years, it's going to be like airplanes.  Commercial airplanes can pretty much fly completely via computer, only really need the pilots for takeoff and landing.  And by takeoff, like 400 feet of elevation for takeoff.  Without computers, I don't even think landing in crazy fog would be possible.

So, and Andrew has even talked about this himself, there will first be a situation where drivers are still in the 18 wheelers, but the vehicles are doing all the decision making for Interstates.  But I still think 5 years is way too soon.

Also, while I'm not an engineer, I have to imagine there's some inflection point that needs to occur so self-driving technology can work.  That is, some percentage of vehicles on the road as self-driving for this to work efficiently and without major problems.  Self driving technology will work best if you can predict/know what all other vehicles are doing.  That's a lot easier to manage than having to make split-second decisions when a human driver does something unexpected near you, like cutting you off or whatever.  And we're not anywhere close to that inflection point.

And I didn't even discuss how it's literally impossible to program morality.  Or perhaps more correct, who decides what is the ""correct"" logic operation in situations like the [Trolley Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem)?

It's inevitable that there will be glitches and mistakes.  The first time a self-driving school bus crashes and kills a bunch of kids will be the last time anyone ever puts their kids on a self-driving school bus.

Truck driving is not just about driving, it's also decision making with regard to payloads.  Drivers direct warehouse workers on items hauled, deal with delivery invoices, etc.

Driving is not just a method of transportation in America, it's an ethos.  It's how many Americans embrace the independent spirit and adventure that is part of our culture.

So don't underestimate the ability of our collective society to resist change.

Driving is not just a method of transportation for Americans, it's a way of life and an ethos.  I just don't see many folks willingly giving up control of their car.  Sure, maybe folks would be ok with a self-driving ride share service, or even sometimes highway driving.  But no one will buy a car where they cannot override the self-driving computer, and I bet laws will be written saying that such provision must be allowed.

Well, all the projected safety and traffic benefits of self-driving vehicles go completely out the window if everyone just overrides it during the moments where such technology would be most useful, like traffic jams or risky road conditions.  Not to mention that pretty much everyone drives over the speed limit at least a little bit, so if self-driving cars restrict speed to the actual listed speed limit, people will be mad as fuck.

I really think everyone, Americans and non-Americans, are very much underestimating how much social resistance there will be to self-driving cars.

246,ballarak,"Step 1: Use AI to make undetectable changes to outdoor photos. Step 2: release them into the open-source world and enjoy the chaos.

Worries about deep fakes — machine-manipulated videos of celebrities and world leaders purportedly saying or doing things that they really didn’t — are quaint compared to a new threat: doctored images of the Earth itself.

China is the acknowledged leader in using an emerging technique called generative adversarial networks to trick computers into seeing objects in landscapes or in satellite images that aren’t there, says Todd Myers, automation lead and Chief Information Officer in the Office of the Director of Technology at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

“The Chinese are well ahead of us. This is not classified info,” Myers said Thursday at the second annual Genius Machines summit, hosted by Defense One and Nextgov. “The Chinese have already designed; they’re already doing it right now, using GANs—which are generative adversarial networks—to manipulate scenes and pixels to create things for nefarious reasons.”

For example, Myers said, an adversary might fool your computer-assisted imagery analysts into reporting that a bridge crosses an important river at a given point.  

“So from a tactical perspective or mission planning, you train your forces to go a certain route, toward a bridge, but it’s not there. Then there’s a big surprise waiting for you,” he said.

First described in 2014, GANs represent a big evolution in the way neural networks learn to see and recognize objects and even detect truth from fiction.

Say you ask your conventional neural network to figure out which objects are what in satellite photos. The network will break the image into multiple pieces, or pixel clusters, calculate how those broken pieces relate to one another, and then make a determination about what the final product is, or, whether the photos are real or doctored. It’s all based on the experience of looking at lots of satellite photos.

GANs reverse that process by pitting two networks against one another — hence the word“adversarial.” A conventional network might say, “The presence of x, y, and z in these pixel clusters means this is a picture of a cat.” But a GAN network might say, “This is a picture of a cat, so x, y, and z must be present. What are x, y, and z and how do they relate?” The adversarial network learns how to construct, or generate, x, y, and z in a way that convinces the first neural network, or the discriminator, that something is there when, perhaps, it is not.

A lot of scholars have found GANs useful for spotting objects and sorting valid images from fake ones. In 2017, Chinese scholars used GANs to identify roads, bridges, and other features in satellite photos.

The concern, as AI technologists told Quartz last year, is that the same technique that can discern real bridges from fake ones can also help create fake bridges that AI can’t tell from the real thing.

Myers worries that as the world comes to rely more and more on open-source images to understand the physical terrain, just a handful of expertly manipulated data sets entered into the open-source image supply line could create havoc. “Forget about the [Department of Defense] and the [intelligence community]. Imagine Google Maps being infiltrated with that, purposefully? And imagine five years from now when the Tesla [self-driving] semis are out there routing stuff?” he said.

When it comes to deep fake videos of people, biometric indicators like pulse and speech can defeat the fake effect. But faked landscape isn’t vulnerable to the same techniques.

Even if you can defeat GANs, a lot of image-recognition systems can be fooled by adding small visual changes to the physical objects in the environment themselves, such as stickers added to stop signs that are barely noticeable to human drivers but that can throw off machine vision systems, as DARPA program manager Hava Siegelmann has demonstrated.


Myers says the military and intelligence community can defeat GAN, but it’s time-consuming and costly, requiring multiple, duplicate collections of satellite images and other pieces of corroborating evidence. “For every collect, you have to have a duplicate collect of what occurred from different sources,” he said. “Otherwise, you’re trusting the one source.”

The challenge is both a technical and a financial one.

“The biggest thing is the funding required to make sure you can do what I just talked about,” he said.

On Thursday, U.S. officials confirmed that data integrity is a rising concern. “It’s something we care about in terms of protecting our data because if you can get to the data you can do the poisoning, the corruption, the deceiving and the denials and all of those other things,” said Lt. Gen. Jack Shanahan, who runs the Pentagon’s new Joint Artificial Intelligence Center. “We have a strong program protection plan to protect the data. If you get to the data, you can get to the model.”

But when it comes to protecting open-source data and images, used by everybody from news organizations to citizens to human rights groups to hedge funds to make decisions about what is real and what isn’t, the question of how to protect it is frighteningly open. The gap between the “truth” that the government can access and the “truth” that the public can access may soon become unbridgeable, which would further erode the public credibility of the national security community and the functioning of democratic institutions.

Andrew Hallman, who heads the CIA’s Digital Directorate, framed the question in terms of epic conflict. “We are in an existential battle for truth in the digital domain,” Hallman said. “That’s, again, where the help of the private sector is important and these data providers. Because that’s frankly the digital conflict we’re in, in that battle space…This is one of my highest priorities.”

When asked if he felt the CIA had a firm grasp of the challenge of fake information in the open-source domain, Hallman said, “I think we are starting to. We are just starting to understand the magnitude of the problem.”",1554140582,ejvzdyw,t3_b85oms,technology,t5_2qh16,2019

Apple actually declined last quarter top and bottom lines.   Their guidance for quarter just ended is another decline.   

FANG is about growth.   Apple is an excellent investment for a dividend and safety.  But Apple is NOT growing.  Let alone 20%+ growth.

262,NewUserNewMe,"Not here try to bash you, just trying to educate those who are unfamiliar with the subject:

1) One of the biggest misconceptions out there is that self driving cars introduce the vulnerability of your car being hacked. Most cars out there now can already be hacked since everything is becoming more and more controlled electronically. Your brakes, steering and accelerators are all electronic, controlled by computers, not manual. Just look up the guys who can completely take over a Jeep Cherokee remotely over cell service. 

Tesla’s are actually safer than most cars out there now when it comes to preventing hacking. 
2 reasons: 1) They have the ability to rapid deploy security patches to every car in their fleet. What other company can push out updates over the air to their cars to make them more secure? Some car companies are adopting over the air updates in newer cars though, so they’ll soon be able to do that as well. 2) Tesla actually takes IT security very seriously and have events in which they invite white hat hackers to come in and try to break into the car. If they can get in, Tesla implements security patches to prevent it in the future.

2) Computers can absolutely do things better than humans can. Autopilot is still learning and still needs to get better before it can beat humans. It learns from its environment like a child would. I would say that it’s still a toddler right now, but it will become an adult in the future. Autopilot doesn’t require a software developer to code in where each and every turn in the highway is. That would be terrible if they did because our infrastructure sucks, and is always changing. 

A few reasons why computers will eventually beat humans at driving: they never get tired, they can make decisions based on 360° view thousands of times per second, their reaction times are much faster than ours which will help reduce traffic. For example, my car uses radar and can see cars in front of me that are blocked by my view of the car immediately in front of me. If a car slams on the breaks and the driver in front of me doesn’t react, I wouldn’t see the impending crash coming, but my car would and would break to avoid it. I don’t have a timeline when computers will drive better than us, but I can guarantee that they will become better at driving than us in the future.",1554399808,ek47b9b,t1_ek3qlvp,technology,t5_2qh16,2019

&amp;#x200B;

Self driving cars work already in optimal situations and with the caveat of safety driver handling the unexpected. For regulators to agree to the removal of the culpable responsible party, safety driver, they will probably want just a 5 years of study on completely completed system to begin with.

&amp;#x200B;

Autonomous vehicle fully in traffic is fully different than say autonomous pod in controlled area or even track in limited speed and area with possibly fixed remote monitoring.

&amp;#x200B;

On traffic in cities? GPS fails or mislead among high rises, the network connection will fail, There will be a new workers setting up on manhole X with zero warning and trusting drivers know *these flimsy cones and fences means avoid us please, we are inside here and can pop out at any moment.* There will be unexpected road work. Completely irrational drivers doing nuts stuff like driving the wrong side of the road. Accidents. People not following rules at all etc. Snow might just one day fall on the streets making lane marking following useless. Heck the lane marks could be just wrongly painted. etc. etc. etc. Odd surface materials that give odd reflections on LIDAR. Some surface with some super absorber paint, that doesn't give reflection return. Another weird acoustic material that gives hard time to ultrasound scans. etc. etc. Suddenly mist bloom that obscures the cameras and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

The amount of adaptability needed is crazy. And that autonomous driver must be much better than humans. Humans aren't perfect drivers, but specially in city with unpredictability they have advantage of adaptability. So the car needs to be much better. Because otherwise the regulators will just say. We have already an autonomous control system for vehicles. Use it. It is called hiring a driver.

&amp;#x200B;

At long haul highway running cars have advantage. No amount of driving tires them. They have literally superhuman perception to the state of the vehicle and superhuman reaction times. Even at 12 hours running, that AI is as sharp as it was at hour 1. It is highly unlikely to crash out by taking corner too fast or losing traction. Since it has exact traction data and not the human gut feel. It can reach in milliseconds to traction surface changes and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

Still stuff like ""well it has snowed, where is the road"" will still be a problem. Is the GPS accurate enough, is the map the defining the route accurate enough. It has snowed, thus the surrounding topology has just changes, so that makes contour mapping to known area model hard. Also there is where the lanes are supposed to go and where people actually drive based on the developed snow grooves of the road and so on. Lane markers are no use, those are under 10 cm of opaque snow. Try to judge the banks? well has the snow plow done a tight cut or wide cut. On wider cut, what seems the flat surface on the edge side of the road is actually loose snow on top of the ditch. Need to know to drive kinda middlish. But how middle since there is no middle line. Kinda follow the grooves, but don't when those seem to go weird. There is also possibly side sticks for the plow. But again see if some of  them have dislodged, turned weird and so on.

Add in less common but newly required human time, like if there's an accident involving the car. An automated car can't talk to the police, tell the tow company where it wants to go, fill out an accident report, etc. Then there's the fact that self-driving cars will be more expensive, and the company will have to outlay a large amount of capital to buy them (and pay interest on that debt).

314,farrago_uk,"We are discussing whether people will want to use car-as-a-service instead of owning a car. So if the service’s fuel or insurance costs go down, so do an owners costs in the same way. 

That’s always going to be a trade off between higher up-front costs of owning vs higher per-use costs of renting. Renting is always more expensive in total because you are paying all the ownership costs plus a profit margin. However your particular costs are only the fraction you use the vehicle. The lower the profit margin the greater fraction of use you can have before it becomes more expensive than owning (ignoring the general value of exclusive ownership). 

As it stands taxis and rental cars are seen as too expensive, so the question is what can be cut from the current profit margins, to bring renting closer to buying (or rather push out the break even point between rent and buy beyond most peoples requirements). The only thing self-driving cars change is the driver. 

So I think it’s reasonable to look at employees and see “does it seem like automating away their jobs would save a lot of money”? Front line fast food employees get paid as little as legally possible. Some Walmarts famously ask customers to donate food for their own employees who don’t make enough to live on. Uber drivers often make below minimum wage. Automating those jobs just isn’t going to save much because they don’t pay much. Have you noticed a significant drop in cost to you with the McDonald’s touch screen ordering, or self checkout at supermarkets?

Why not? Because you are right that companies are largely very efficient otherwise a more efficient competitor would offer the same service for less and take over the market. In fact Uber is currently so “efficient” that you get the service for 75% of the cost of providing that service (thank you VC companies for funding my taxi rides). 

Now if you could automate programming, legal advice, financial planning or other similar high salary jobs then yes there is a lot of scope to reduce costs. But not in driving cars.

They also[ just bought a company](https://www.careem.com/en-ae/) for ~3.6 billion, so they certainly have some extra capital to throw around even if they aren't ""Profitable"" right now.

&gt; We first floated our suspicions past a senior engineer at a luxury car brand which has plans to launch an autonomous car. “This absolutely makes sense,” he replied. “Google has a history of using humans to verify and improve their OCR recognition through reCaptcha in the past. Applying the same resources to verify and improve their image processing, machine learning, and AI algorithms **is the next logical step**. Autonomous driving is all about big data and AI, and this is **likely part of their program.**” 

&gt;So, it’s confirmed. Google does use reCaptcha to teach its self-driving Waymo cars to label images

The original reporter on ceros.com asked some engineer that isn't even affiliated with google, but a `luxury car brand`. And he speculated that they might be using it to teach their cars to drive. Which of course meant they can confirm their wild speculations that this is how the system works.

Even the article linked states:
&gt; Michael Cutter, who holds a PhD in Computer Engineering, **speculates** that the CAPTCHA data is being used to double-check the AI’s work.

381,evangellydonut,"&gt;machine learning is that once -one- car learns how to do something correctly/safely then they ALL know

Except machine learning is never 100% accurate. Maybe we can get to 99% with the best type of convolutional-neural-nets, but that last 1% is a big part of the problem. Is car-A's 99% from driving in California mountain snow the same as car-B's 99% from driving in Detroit cold winter? Then there are situations where there's simply not enough data to be become good at it, at least not until plenty of major accidents prior. If there's a blown tire at the front driver side at 65mph in the center lane of a freeway, the AI algorithm will be different than at the rear passenger side. If it's a 2 lane freeway, it'll be different than a 7 lane freeway. If it's day vs night, if it's heavily congested vs sparse traffic. At which point does machine-learning takes over from if/then/else statements in code? (I don't claim to be the subject matter expert, but I've written enough machine-learning code to know a thing or two)

Will a self-driving car be safer than human piloted car in the near future? of course. Will it be at a point where people are readily accept the risk? probably not for much longer time. End of the day, argument won't be ""self driving car is safer"", but rather liability. If I drunk drive into a fire-truck and kills myself, that's different than a tesla doing so in auto-pilot from a liability point of view and at least in my opinion, insurance won't alleviate the situation. I can make sure that I don't drive under influence, but I can't justify auto-pilot related accident that puts me in a hospital. Then there's also the moral-hazard question - do you kill 3 on present course, or kill 1 by changing course? What's right vs wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps where the uncertainty is coming from has to do with the software implementation. Full self driving is not being achieved by “programming in” all of the variables that someone encounters while driving. Machine learning is exactly how you solve this problem, because neural networks are modeled after the same neural network in your brain. It all works on probabilities and past experiences, and is constantly improving itself. 

For example, Tesla showed how they trained cut ins to the neural network using something they call “shadow mode”. While users are driving their Tesla’s all over the world, their cars have been secretly predicting the behavior of the environment around them, such as a 3D prediction of where a road might go, even when the road is obscured from view. 

With cut ins, or when someone changes lanes from an adjacent lane to your lane, there are certain cues that we pick up on as humans. Maybe the car hugs the lane markers a little closer, maybe their blinker is on, maybe you see the wheels turn a little, etc. After observing thousands and thousands of cut ins, the neural network is now able to identify cut ins before they happen. Currently nothing is being executed with that knowledge, but the cars have that knowledge. As time progresses, this learning will happen exponentially with more cars and more data. 

You may want to reconsider your skepticism about self driving cars. They’re safer than human drivers already, and they’ll be available to purchase soon.

426,dinominant,"I considered buying a tesla not too long ago, but having to pay $10000 more above the base price (which is still too much) for an incomplete solution was a deal breaker. On top of that the hardware sensors are fundamentally lacking and cannot stop the vehicle safely because it cannot detect objects in front of the car at times. With the kinds of sensors we have available today, it is totally unacceptable that a human operator can view, in full daylight, an obvious object, yet the car is inclined to drive full speed into it.

Even with lots of updates, it is dangerous to drive any current tesla without your full attention on the road. It is a neat trick, but it is not a smart financial decision to spend money on an incomplete solution, expecting it to be fixed with a software update.

It is false advertising to make the \*implication\* that a tesla can safely drive you to/from any destination without fatal consequences given enough software updates with the current hardware platform.

The technology is great, and the advancements are great too. But people are being killed because they have the false belief that their car is fully autonomous, and advertising campaigns like this are contributing to that.

Perhaps my next vehicle will be a Tesla in a few years, when charging outside of large municipalities is a viable option for long trips. But I am not going to put my life in the hands of an AI that was trained in a small subset of real world road conditions, with a set of sensors priced down to a good-enough level.

As for your new and completely unrelated point, the data does in fact show that current self driving is an order of magnitude safer than human drivers.

There may be educated guesses, obvious signs like the tower swaying dramatically, but otherwise its not easy to tell.

They have people that pick out those hard (for the algorithm) edge cases and literally mark the right answers for it. Draw the lines where there are none, marking chickens, drunk idiots, and making sure that a truck that carries a car that carries a bike is marked as 1 object and not 2 vehicles mashed together and a bike riding sideways without a cyclist. Then those answers are fed into the net to run a few million times in simulations and then again to search for similar situations in the wild and see what the algorithm does.

Tesla runs the whole self driving suite in shadow mode while you drive normally, making predictions all the time, sending it's mess ups to the HQ constantly.

Imaging. They do multispectral imaging. Visible 360 with 8 cameras, forward facing radar to blast through any weather unless it rains rocks, and I believe 12 ultrasonic sensors for low speed high accuracy collision warning/prevention. Idk what else do you want. If cameras can't see more then 30 feet ahead through the fog, neither can you and you shouldn't be on the road anyway. Ultraviolet and beyond is useless for driving, don't wanna be zapping people with gamma rays. Infrared? Also useless if you already have radar, so yeah, they have the usable spectrum covered. More radars? Waste of energy. It's mostly needed to check what distance cameras a measuring anyway. Probably not only that but I can't think of anything else right now. And how high is high resolution 3d mapping? They are doing full HD, on 8 cameras at over 2000 fps on new computer hardware. Nothing on the market comes even close to that. Not in a package fit for a car anyway. And they are running 2 of these computers both with separate operating systems, at the same time, with cross-check on data, and both fully redundant. All important data lines on cars after october(?) 2016 are redundant and some power lines too I believe. They even have aux power if you lose whole main battery. Bet it's not much, but enough to get you off the road safely. Heck, even the power steering has a redundant motor. Damn things are built like space ships compared to other cars.

Ambiguous sensors and whitelisting/blaklisting: https://forums.tesla.com/forum/forums/anyone-have-tacc-hit-breaks-when-going-under-bridges

There is lots of information available from the surrounding vehicles that is context senstive. A vehicle that is tending to one side of a lane is probably going to change lanes -- something is unusual and is going to change. Does the AI track the past behaviour, current behaviour, and anticipated behaviour of the vehicles around it and around those? I do, and I've avoided many collisions because of that. I am not confident a tesla can anticipate the car in front of the one I am following -- on the highway can can be *very* important.

The car should be able to drive on all drivable surfaces, without prior exposure to that exact location to make the claim that it is ""**full** self driving"". As more of the autonomous vehicles replace conventional ones, the driving conditions will change considerably and that has not been tested or trained into the net. It's a problem of [unknown unknowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns).

I'm not trying to say that they are using inferior technology. It's very impressive for a consumer vehicle. However, their marketing is painting a picture of fancy 'droid cars that will drive you without you needing to worry at all and you will be safe because it's a tesla. It's like saying you are safe from an accident because you are surrounded by airbags. The airbags help, and are worth installing, but you are still in danger, even if it is reduced. I want them to quantify it with cold hard numbers, and hard science. Make it easy for me to find and verify that information too, I'm a potential customer and one who will share my experience with other potential customers.

If they can in fact outperform a human in all conditions (safe or otherwise), then where is the proof!?

nothing stops Tesla from trying to pay off victims of their faulty software, but there is an inherent calculation being made here:  Tesla will be able to pay off claims for less than the courts will award victims, both for damage and as punishment.  The answer to that question is that Tesla will not be able to afford to pay off all of their victims.

Software liability is a much larger issue.  Almost every pieces of software you depend upon in your life is exempted from software liability.

Is AP supposed to pick up on this stuff? Of course, especially now. But it's stuff like this that teaches the net the best. Does tesla work on predictive behavior? Oh yes. They already have a very good algorithm for predicting the turns of the road without seeing them and for cars and pedestrians it's also already implemented to some degree. Is it perfect? No, you shouldn't rely on it completely yet, but it's getting better every day.
 
&gt; I am not confident a tesla can anticipate the car in front of the one I am following -- on the highway can can be very important.

Agreed and idk. Maybe it can't in it's current state. But Tesla team saw all the test that you and me saw and more on top of that. Pretty sure they know limitations of the system better then any of us. Now, about driveable surfaces. Water is a drivable surface with enough speed and right tires. What are we talking here? Snow and unclear lane markings are being worked on all the time. Gravel or dirt roads? You don't want anything self driving on that unless it's a tank. Not saying it's impossible but I don't think Tesla even started on that. Those will remain in human domain for quite a while. Is this your problem with the name? Not being able to drive on anything that can hold the weight of a car? Or do you want it to be called ""Full self driving on paved roads""?

&gt; As more of the autonomous vehicles replace conventional ones, the driving conditions will change considerably and that has not been tested or trained into the net.

The more the better. Every new well made bot on the road makes it safer because it does far less stupid stuff then humans. If the net is trained for humans, bots are a walk in the park. Over time some form of car to car communication will be implemented. Either by Tesla or someone else and it will become near impossible for collisions to happen. Will humans be hurt as the system finds new ways to fail? Most likely. But it's still far better then some drunk jerk plowing through a bus stop wasting lives for no reason. I'd rather hear about 1 death a year because AP failed and huge investigation into it, then about thousands of deaths every year that no one even looks at properly because everyone knows that humans suck at driving. 

&gt;However, their marketing is painting a picture of fancy 'droid cars that will drive you without you needing to worry at all and you will be safe because it's a tesla.

Tesla is objectively the safest car on the road and the [stats](https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyReport?redirect=no) are, it's about twice as safe with AP on. And that's with hardware 2.5. 

&gt;As part of their validation process they do have to test this and demonstrate functionality...

As soon as it's ready the car will go to regulators and I'm sure they will tear it apart before letting the bots roam free. But when NHTSA says it's ok, it's most of the proof you need right there. You'll probably hear about it by the end of the year. Then it will have to be validated with all the other countries, but Tesla's system thrives in constant testing, so it's gonna be fine even if it takes a year or 2 more. FSD is never going to be ""done"". It can only be done up to 99,9999...%. At that point it's the length of your tail of 9's that counts. I'l be happy if they make it to 6th. I have a license, but I can't drive anything that has more then 2 wheels to save my life.

465,pnkrvyobr,"&gt;Why are you listing so many things that aren't energy storage? Solar generation is not energy storage. Model Y is not energy storage. Model 3 is not energy storage.

Do you not know what a gigafactory is?

&gt;Energy storage production in the second half of 2018 was limited by cell production as we routed all available Gigafactory 1 cell capacity to supply Model 3.

They specifically state how they took resources from energy storage production and rerouted them to maximize output of the Model 3. Then, they specifically state how they've made improvements to the efficiency of the new gigafactories (like the one for the Model Y in Shanghai) being produced, which will cut cost and increase production time. 

Not only will there be more gigafactories, each gigafactory will now be better. Increased production time = increased cells = increased energy storage. 

Also, if you put a solar panel on a roof, where does that energy get stored? You don't generate solar energy without storing it. If you don't see the vision of having every residential home store energy and sell the excess to the grid I don't know what to say - you said it yourself they're the only recognizable name in the market. They address more of your concerns about that in [their Q1 financial report.](https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/b2218d34-fbee-4f1f-ac95-050eb29dd42f)

Capitalism always ends in one company, look at their vision. Make every home have a solar panel which stores energy in your Tesla Powerwall which you use to power your efficient smart home and self driving car free of gas and then excess power is sold to the grid and distributed. They make all the batteries for all the electronics, all the solar panels to generate the energy, all the powerwalls to hold them, they make all the replacement parts for the car, etc. 

Did I mention underground and outerspace developments via Boring and SpaceX? Autopilot high speed tunnels with no traffic and 15 minute international flights by rocket?

Apple wants your media, Amazon wants your shopping, Google wants your advertising, Tesla wants your energy. They are positioning themselves so much better end game than just being a car company.

A 70k pickup is a heavy duty pickup. The current crop of EV pickups right now are light truck replacements so you're paying a 20k+ premium for the EV over a gas equivalent.

So asking those people to spend 30k+ more is asking a lot.

I own a 72k heavy duty diesel pickup. I would love to have a EV, but until they are a like for like replacement I can't justify it. My truck is part of my livelihood.

468,happyscrappy,"&gt; Do you not know what a gigafactory is?

I know what a gigafactory is. It's Tesla's name for a big battery plant. Problem is they don't have the only ones. Everyone can make large battery factories if they want and their competitors have where it makes sense. Their competitors have more factories than Tesla. Sometimes more smaller factories makes as much or more sense. Musk can't understand this, he's stuck in the Ford River Rouge past. I can understand this. You can too if you try.

'Energy storage production in the second half of 2018 was limited by cell production as we routed all available Gigafactory 1 cell capacity to supply Model 3.'

&gt; They specifically state how they took resources from energy storage production and rerouted them to maximize output of the Model 3.

That will increase production. They, and I, said margins, not production. Why do we expect margins to rise?

&gt; They address more of your concerns about that in their Q1 financial report.

Not really. They explain they'll execute better. So will their competitors. And yes, they are the name in home energy storage. Which is why I pondered why they can't figure out how to make a good margin.

&gt; They make all the batteries for all the electronics, all the solar panels to generate the energy, all the powerwalls to hold them, they make all the replacement parts for the car, etc.

Vertical integration isn't the panacea you think it is. Their competitors already went through vertical integration and now realize moving past it is the smart thing.

&gt; Can't go back to a car that doesn't drive itself. Gas feels like a flip phone.

They aren't even the leaders in self-driving and there is no reason to think they will be the only electric car in the market.

It's at the premium end of the market, sure, but $70k is really competitive there... Especially when you're talking about the fastest pickup truck in the world *and* the first EV pickup truck.

I just went on Ford's website to see what a Raptor with all the driving assist tech costs, and it came out to about $66k. And after government EV incentives, the Rivian will probably cost around the same. Then you look at the Raptor's 5.7 second 0-60 time...

At the very least, the 0-60 time has to be pretty accurate. With prototypes on the road, they will have already tested the actual 0-60 time, and they'd shut up about it if the vehicle wasn't accomplishing what they thought it would. 

The price is going to be harder to predict, as it will depend on some unknown factors. I'm sure they've put some smart and experienced people in charge of figuring out that sort of thing, but unexpected problems can always come up. I can't speak to the people who *actually* run Rivian, but if I was running that show, I'd definitely make sure the advertised $70k base price became a reality after advertising that so heavily ... even if I had to sell them at a profit margin that was barely recouping the cost or even at a loss if I had to. There's still a little wiggle room in that, though. $70k is the *base* price, and they haven't put in a huge amount of details about what's included on the base model. The bigger battery pack will of course be much more expensive, but it may also be that the self-driving tech costs extra, the adjustable suspension costs extra, etc, etc ... which would make your 'average' Rivian sold much more expensive than $70k because people want the fancy options, even if the base model with no options is technically available for $70k ... with a production run of 5 units, while the fully-optioned versions for $110k have a production run of 2000 units.

Again, you make the assumption that SpaceX has a cost advantage. There is no evidence to support that hypothesis, only the claim of a man who also makes wild claims about all sorts of things such as self-driving cars, etc., which are flat out lies. When a pathological liar lies, I assume they they are lying until I see evidence to the contrary. Musk's acquaintance with the truth is so remote that if he sad the sky was blue I'd want other opinions.

Regarding the progress of rocketry, here is what I mean: if you look at, say, aircraft propulsion from around 1904 to 1942 nothing much changed. Yes, the Merlin was one hell of a major improvement over the Wright Flyer motor but it was still a piston engine. In contrast, the invention of jet propulsion was a major, radical, change over piston/prop: it gave us capabilities which weren't even dreamed of in the propeller era. Nothing like that has happened since the V2: the V2 has, more or less, the same function as the latest rocket of the line today: the materials may be better, the tolerances better, and so on, but they are pretty much the same machine just as the Merlin is an advanced Wright engine. 

SpaceX may claim to have advanced rocketry but those advances are incremental and not radical. They haven't changed the game just moved it along. Somebody else will move it along further.

Regarding the importance of launch costs, it obvious if you could save $50M from a mission then a small number of missions which would be uneconomical become economical. So what? How does that change anything of importance? How does that transform the industry? What would transform the industry is if somebody figured out how to keep a cheap spacecraft alive but nobody can. If they could that would, perhaps, make a big change except there is a modest number of economically viable projects where space makes sense. A few more would make sense if costs drop a lot, but not that many.

I have seen a few fools claim that lower launch costs (assuming those exist) will enable cheaper spacecraft. On its face this is absurd: any company which could provide better value for money in spacecraft would own the industry and they don't have to wait for a cheaper bus to do it.",1556588239,em3uggi,t1_em2ooud,technology,t5_2qh16,2019
487,7f0b,"&gt; commuting car is a small electric and then you can still have a fun weekend car with a big v8.

It's most likely your daily commuter car will be autonomous (FSD, full self-driving) but you'll still want to *drive* a car for fun every once in a while (likely on a track). Your fun car might be gas-powered but may also be electric, and will probably be more electric as time goes on.",1556632832,em4zhax,t1_em4vvkt,technology,t5_2qh16,2019
488,jabbadarth,"It will. 

When all cars drive themselves they can accelerate at the same rate and drive fast in close proximity without all the brake tapping and snaking we see now. A large portion of congestion comes from accidents, rubber necking and braking on highways. Almost all of those things are eliminated with self driving cars.",1556633442,em50cin,t1_em4xjrh,technology,t5_2qh16,2019
489,NintendoTim,"I would love to buy an electric car. I've been eyeing the shit out of the Model 3 (tho I hate the idea of a touch-only center dash), and the idea of the Model Y just gets me hot and bothered, but two huge issues I have with full electric cars:

 - Still too expensive (I will never consider a car over $30k)
 - Can't charge it at home unless you live in a detached single family home or an HOA without a stick up their ass

I live in a townhome with an INCREDIBLY strict HOA. They won't allow charging stations to be installed in parking spots, and I can't drag an extension cord over the sidewalk to my car to charge.

Until FEVs/BEVs (whatever you want to call them) can get under $25k (before any incentives) with 350+ mile range, I can't seriously consider them. However, the automation that Tesla is showing off is making the Model 3 just that much more enticing; I cannot wait for our self-driving overlords to take over.",1556641009,em5bzsi,t1_em4snrw,technology,t5_2qh16,2019
490,wrongmoviequotes,"&gt; Mass transit is the only solution. And we're currently going in the complete opposite direction.

We aren't. Development of electric cars has been happening hand in hand with development of self driving technology due to the overlap in skillsets at high tech auto makers. 

Self driving technology, by design, reduces the need for car ownership. People have cars because they need to be assured of availability, with self driving tech and regional dispatch facilities you can serve individual cars, vans and buses out based on usage metrics to your community. optimization of transport resources by centralizing their dispatch reduces the overhead necessary to have on the road, you also take away the need for any one vehicle to be ""parked"", a smaller volume of vehicles can remain active with a high up-time and more efficient trip usage. It would also be significantly cheaper, which further disincentives individual ownership.",1556641605,em5czat,t1_em553s3,technology,t5_2qh16,2019
491,hardxstyle,"Heating absolutely doesn't affect mileage on an internal combustion gasoline powered car. The heating is accomplished by simply bypassing engine coolant flow through an in-cabin heater core (a smaller secondary radiator). 

A/C is parasitic in that the drive belt for the compressor operates off crank power, and the more crank power that's wasted on anything but driving the wheels, will inherently inhibit overall performance. 

While lower ambient temperature in the extremes will waste more fuel strictly by the fact that A) most people idle their vehicle warm up their car's cabin before driving, and B) without ""warming up your car"" in the sense of allowing the engine to reach operating temperature, the fuel map will be running richer (some older EFI systems actuation an auxiliary cold start injector under X operating temperature) and less efficient until registering operating temp. However, cold temperatures actually increase engine performance and efficiency.

I'm all for the push towards the necessity of more sustainable transport. I'm a car enthusiast, but I specifically like incredibly fuel efficient 4 cylinder (or less) vehicles. I also have a lot of interest in electric, hydrogen, and alternative fuel power and very much differentiate my hobby with the needs of the masses that have zero interest in what they're driving, other than comfortably getting from point A to B. However, I also believe mass public train transit is a more effective and viable answer well above personal (and self driving) personal vehicles in a lot of cases.

Regardless, a lot of what you're stating simply is not factual.",1556641723,em5d63p,t1_em5a0hx,technology,t5_2qh16,2019
492,RamenJunkie,"As we also shift to self driving cars in the near future, we will likely shift to a world without car ownership, where cars just sort of show up as needed and are owned by a fleet company (like Uber).  These cars will drive other people when not driving you.  

Wanting a lot of mileage out of these cars will be part of what the fleet company will want, to keep maitenence costs low.  So pushing for 500k isn't unreasonable in the long term.",1556642351,em5e7gg,t1_em4yt9m,technology,t5_2qh16,2019
