Imagine getting dropped off by the car, and either sending it home, or to go to a cheap parking lot to wait until you need to be picked up.  

It could eliminate the need for street parking entirely, except for 15 minute parking.

I could see people making apps for your car computer that connect to the internet and calculate the lowest cost parking lot based on price and distance.  Small businesses would pop up overnight to buy cheap land to make into cheap daily parking.

When you're not using your vehicle 95% of the time, taking self-driving cabs should be much cheaper than owning one.  Whenever you wanted to go somewhere, you could just order one, which would get to you within a few minutes, or just a few seconds once they are really popular and plentiful.

Indeed, since most trips are solo, most of the cabs could be single-seaters - 30% the size of regular cars and 3 times as efficient.  And considering that most are likely to be electric, that would mean very low running costs.  

Of course, those who really wanted their own vehicle could still buy one, or perhaps simply their own private, customisable passenger capsule designed to clip into a public self-drive module.",1338090478,c4st3fu,t1_c4somfq,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011

And maintenance on your own car becomes much easier.  Instead of dropping off the car and having to take a taxi home, just send the car in alone for the day.  Or you could even have the shop send for the car when they are almost ready for it.

Obviously people who work out of their vehicles, such as handymen, painters, etc, that have to keep a lot of their stuff in their trucks, will be unlikely to switch to taxis for work at least. 

But I think although switching over to taxis might become really common for people who live in cities, it will be a lot less common in the suburbs and outlying areas.  At least for another generation.

12,nosoupforyou,"I agree.  Now if public transport could be changed so that it's thousands of self-driving capsules on a track instead of a few long heavy noisy trains, it would be fantastically effective.

Can you imagine getting dropped off at the commuter station, and while your car heads back to your house, you hop in a train capsule, punch in your destination (any stop, any city, and any state), it takes you directly there using whatever tracks exist (much like the internet), where you then hop out and jump into a local self-driving taxi.

Don't worry about missing your train and having to wait 40 minutes for the non-express.  Don't worry about having to get there early enough to pay for parking and buy your ticket.  Just hop in and go whenever.

With self driving capsules on the track, they can all be elevated too, so they don't block streets.  And since they aren't 60 ton trains, there will be no need for blaring train horns.

13,CorporatePsychopath,"&gt;I'm thinking owning is always going to be cheaper than renting. But definitely renting has it's advantages. No maintenance costs, no license stickers, no parking issues, etc.

The ongoing costs of taking self-drive taxis will, of course, be higher than for vehicle owners.  But when you don't need to buy the car in the first place, think of how much would be saved.  Self-drive cabs don't need to pay for drivers, and they can run 24/7.  It's a simple matter of efficiency - most people aren't using their cars 90%+ of the time, so those vehicles might as well be used by others in need of transportation.  A fleet of vehicles might be able to service a population 10 or 20 times it's size (quite possibly much more).  Although, bottlenecking at certain peak times is going to require a bare minimum.

&gt;Long distance trips would be far more expensive in a taxi than in your own car, even with self-driving vehicles.

I actually believe that a lot of long-distance travellers will take advantage of the nighttime when many more taxis will be available.  Just take a overnight sleeper, and wake up the next morning at your destination address 1000 km away.  

&gt;And maintenance on your own car becomes much easier. Instead of dropping off the car and having to take a taxi home, just send the car in alone for the day. Or you could even have the shop send for the car when they are almost ready for it.

Well, maintenance is definitely something that can be done cheaper on a managed fleet than a bunch of privately owned cars.

&gt;Obviously people who work out of their vehicles, such as handymen, painters, etc, that have to keep a lot of their stuff in their trucks, will be unlikely to switch to taxis for work at least.

Maybe, or maybe they will just have capsules too, but just larger ones - basically, really big toolboxes - which will be coupled with larger self-drive modules.  If vehicular section ins't needed during the day, it can leave the capsule at the worksite, and another one ordered at the and of the day when needed.  Not only that, but supply runs for materials could be done by unmanned courier vehicles, and even special equipment could be ordered and delivered for the day from a hire company when needed.

&gt;But I think although switching over to taxis might become really common for people who live in cities, it will be a lot less common in the suburbs and outlying areas. At least for another generation.

I still don't see why long distance would be much of a hindrance.  Sure cities-dwellers are going to be the first takers, but unless you're spending most of your time in your car, I don't see the need for ownership.

&gt;I'm not sure I really see the point of a public self-drive module without a passenger capsule. I don't think the cost of the self-driving part is going to be that expensive. Maybe a few grand at most. I doubt if there will be a point to buying a passenger capsule alone.

A few grand is still a few grand.  And without the self-drive module, you don't ever have to worry about refuelling/recharging, upgrading, or (as you pointed out) maintenance, registration or parking.

A big advantage of decoupling the carrying modules and the self-driving modules is that a vehicle can easily change from being a cab to a courier vehicle, so when it's not carrying passengers it can do deliveries instead.  And when driving between the endpoint of one job to the starting point of another, it will use much less power since it won't be carting around all the extra weight.",1338100047,c4suj6t,t1_c4stekm,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011

Oh, I agree.  I just don't think ownership will go away either.  Definitely for me, I'd probably want to own a car, for the same reason I own a house and live in the suburbs.  But if I lived in the city, especially anywhere near downtown, I'd much prefer to have a taxi.

But out in the suburbs, you can't go anywhere without a car, and renting a taxi for all the little trips could add up.

On the other hand, my sister and I could probably get away with just one car instead of 2.

&gt;I actually believe that a lot of long-distance travellers will take advantage of the nighttime when many more taxis will be available. Just take a overnight sleeper, and wake up the next morning at your destination address 1000 km away. 

I'm not sure that would be optimum for 2-4 hour trips.  I really don't want to arrive too early at my destination.  For example, my older sister lives 2 hours away, and getting there before 7am would be kind of crummy.

&gt;Maybe, or maybe they will just have capsules too, but just larger ones - basically, really big toolboxes - which will be coupled with larger self-drive modules. 

Again, the problem comes down to cost.  If the plumber is using his truck to go from location to location all day, it becomes more costly for him to rent taxis than to just own his own vehicle.

&gt;I still don't see why long distance would be much of a hindrance. Sure cities-dwellers are going to be the first takers, but unless you're spending most of your time in your car, I don't see the need for ownership.

It's a matter of cost.  City dwellers generally don't need cars on a day to day basis.  There's plenty of buses, food and groceries are usually within walking distance, and finding parking is a pita, even at your apartment.  Often the only need for a car is to leave the city, or get around the city fast.

But in the suburbs, people drive everywhere, all the time.  It's not simply a matter of your car not being used 90% of the time. It's that you're using your car a lot more.  If I were commuting via the train every day, sure I'd take a taxi to the train station and then one home in the evening, but that's because it's only a few short trips a week.

&gt;A few grand is still a few grand. And without the self-drive module, you don't ever have to worry about refuelling/recharging, upgrading, or (as you pointed out) maintenance, registration or parking.

You always have to worry about those things, even with a capsule.  Maybe not refuelling, but upgrading, maintenance, registration, and parking you would.  Everything wears out.  You ever own a trailer that you pull with your car?  Registration too. You really think the state won't insist on registering them?  They want their cut!  Parking?  Really?  Where do you think they will sit?

I don't see it.  I don't believe we'll have separate capsules.  Not unless they can fold up and be stored in the garage.  But if they could, then why not fold up the driving part too?

I could see it if you owned several kinds of capsules and a driving module, and you could fold up the others to store them, but I still have to wonder if that would happen.

One of the car mfr's prototyped a car that could have different tops a few years ago.  You could own a single-driver module, a sedan module, and a pickup module.  You'd just go to the dealership and they would switch your car's top to whatever you wanted.  The idea was that you'd basically own one car that could do anything.  It never got out of prototyping.

&gt;A big advantage of decoupling the carrying modules and the self-driving modules is that a vehicle can easily change from being a cab to a courier vehicle, so when it's not carrying passengers it can do deliveries instead. And when driving between the endpoint of one job to the starting point of another, it will use much less power since it won't be carting around all the extra weight.

Maybe, but I still don't see it happening.  Adding in the coupling part just adds another place for problems to happen.  I'm not sure it's really cost effective.  If I own my own capsule, why wouldn't I just splurge on the driving module too?  If so, then why not just get a full unit.

If I'm a taxi business, keeping capsules around to swap means I have capsules that cost me money that aren't out earning money.  Why not just get enough driving modules for all of them, and I won't have to have a driving module race back to my parking lot to swap capsules.  Taxi services will become very competitive and people won't want to wait.",1338126495,c4swp1s,t1_c4suj6t,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011

More security and privacy on the internet. It's not headed that way now but the current trend of government spying and censorship is only a temporary, reactionary growing pain. Circumvention techniques will remain a step ahead and gain public favor, to the dismay of governments everywhere. They will continue to fight in futility against it but the technology will win out. Everyone will benefit from the resulting evolution of cryptography, anonymity, and general infosec literacy. At least will dictatorial regime will completely crumble as a direct consequence of this.

The desktop computer will become nearly extinct, only surviving as an expensive hobbyist's toy. Laptops will be next in line for discontinuation but it won't have happened yet in 2032. Those last holdouts who defended desktop machines will have repositioned themselves for this battle. Most people will have happily moved on to another form factor. I don't think it will be tablets, though those will remain common for some tasks. It won't be cell phones, which themselves will be well on the road to obsolescence. The new tech will be something wearable or extremely compact, possibly similar to Project Glass. It will be a dumb terminal, with all applications running ""in the cloud"" (no one will use that phrase anymore though).

Self-driving cars will be mostly trusted in 2032. An attempt will be made to merge that tech with aerial drones. Nothing will be in widespread use yet, but self-flying vehicles, probably quadrotors or something similar, will be in testing like the Google cars are today. Rather than market them to consumers, companies will probably petition local governments to adopt them for public transportation as an alternative to buses or rail systems. Despite its many advantages, it won't catch on for at least another decade (if ever).

A really good AI will emerge. I think this will be built on the research of the Human Brain Project (formerly Blue Brain) but it could come from anywhere. It will require so much computing power that the software will have to be distributed through the internet, with people running nodes around the world. It will have access to the stored knowledge of the internet, supplementing its intelligence with information; even if it's no more sophisticated than a single human brain, such instant access would make it superhuman. It could be described as the internet achieving sentience. Without a physical body its abilities will be limited. The debates about its personhood and legal rights will begin in earnest. Some may wish to build a robot body for the AI to control, but that won't happen by 2032. This could qualify as a singularity-type event, but it wouldn't be widely recognized as such at the time. People who don't follow tech news closely probably wouldn't even be aware that it happened unless the AI very obviously surpassed human ability. Most likely the AI would be rather benign and have no more influence on the world than a very smart but handicapped human, like Stephen Hawking.",1339093971,c4xjlfq,t3_uowva,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011

- It would be much cheaper to use the self-driving taxi fleet than own your own car. There would be no parking costs and no depreciation from having the car sit idle. Parking lanes, spots, and garages would be liberated for other uses. 
- Using taxis would be more efficient. If your trip is for commuting, a one-seat commuter car could be dispatched. If you want to take the family on a roadtrip, a minivan. If you want to send a load of trash to the dump, a truck. More efficient electric or natural gas cars that need to be refueled more often could become practical if they could drive themselves for re-fueling/re-charging.

Indeed it can't even really be applied to a minority of the population without problems, but in this case this mindset is not a minority issue, it's a lot of people.
Meaning a lot of resources being hoarded and wasted, not only that but meanwhile this event is also propogating the mindset that this is okay, enforcing acceptance of the same thing in a dozen different areas.

But resource issues aren;t what truly annoy me about this, and while that is really more the arrogant, egocentric pretention at the core of property it can be better argued in this case by moving a bit back from that and focusing on the right of implementation problem (or so we might call it).

-He/She owns this vehicle. A confessed reason for the desirability of this is to be able to 'fiddle' with this vehicle. This presents a large immediate issue and a f-ing huge one that's further off.

Immediately it creates an issue due to this risking flaws in self driving software and hardware, or the inevitable demands that the manual control be easily engaged and this being done frequently and at massive risk.

Far more problematic is the less focused issue of general rationality and our complete lack of it.
Right now we have working, functional self-driving cars. Fuck we haven't had a single accident with them, but even if there are bugs those won't be anything that can't be fixed and more topically, wouldn't vanish in the face of international resources and effort. [Start Passionate Tone here] Now every single year, worldwide automobile accidents, issues and so forth cause *millions* of deaths, *even more* injuries, *massive* lost resources (I hate money but in this case it may serve the argument to point out the monetary measure of these resources lost is absolutely spectacular) and (including not only the results of these issues, but also the loss to the act of driving) literally *billions* of lost hours from people's lives.

Just stop for a second and think about that. Try and wrap your head around the mountain of loss, one which exceeds any war you can point to.

Now consider the infrastructure that we physically possess (forget money, that's where a lot of this irrationality comes from), think of the resources that are physically there, think fo the expertese that is already available and think of the legislative authority which (much as it makes every rational anarchist fibre of me boil to mention it) is already fully empowered. And if you don't believe this is capable of doing whatever it pleases then look at every major war in which necessity has made us all forget this collective insanity and just get on with using what we physically have.
Now look up at that list of losses and think how much more it is then any war, if you still need convincing then look at victims of serious crashes and violent injuries and try and find a significant core difference.

A rational society, would at this point be shoving massive resources at this and then it would tell everyone in it's borders that it was illegal to drive an unautomated car and set up central centres to convert every damn thing. The government would foot the bill for this, and don't get that tired nonsense out, yes it's debt. I know. Not only is it all imaginary anyway, but more in the here and now, if it was a more tangible war then we'd foot that bill in a bloody heart beat. If us Brits or the US or any other country was losing that much to a foreign power, against something that patriotism has actually trained the obedient dogs of society to acknowledge. Then we'd not hesitate a moment to stop deluding ourselves and use what we have to do what we need to.[End Passionate Tone here]

But we are not a rational society. Heck we even try to claim that we're a bunch of little societies and which one you're in matters for some reason.

Of course the sad fact is that this applies to a lot of things, energy , aging and so on. But the point here is that a good chunk of why we will not do this with automated cars, is entitled morons claiming that they have some metaphysical claim to a lump of metal and plastic and the government (unless it get's desperate) enforcing the actual claim, which more or less runs along the lines of this is this persons because we'll be violent (but it's okay, because the government says so) to anyone else who touches it.

We can't just get on with it, mainly because most people claim that their imaginary right to own (not possess, possessions actually means something very different and far more sensible) whatever they claim to (short sighted and childish that it is) is more important then all of the above losses. 

And that is getting upvoted.

congestion is next. why would rush hour, with everyone needing to get to work at the same time reduce the number of cars on the road, simply because people didn't own them? they are all going to call for a taxi at once. the self driving car will take care of congestion, by eliminating human inefficiencies.. not by eliminating ownership.

Pollution we are working on hard. pollution controls on cars in the us have already dramatically improved things.  and as the cars become more efficient, even if they are now on the road constantly as taxis that wear out after three years, rather than as privately maintained vehicles.

and population is already peaking. it very likely WILL hit ten billion before its finished, and stabilize at that level for quite some time. according to hans rosling we have already reached ""peak childbirth"" and are now sliding into a much older society.",1341781221,c5b6nev,t1_c5b68bt,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011
28,ChromeCrash,"One point that isn't brought up is how much safer self-driving cars will be. In 2008 there were about 37,260 motor vehicle related deaths according to wikipedia. Motor vehicle deaths would drop without humans behind the wheel. That being said that doesn't mean that there won't be any, it would just be a lot lower. So there will be a reduction in drunk, texting, and just overall incompetent drivers.

That argument put out there, I don't think that Pay-per-use is a good way to go about it, I would think that having a subscription to the service would make more sense; the company that is offering the service would be able to keep their vehicles better maintained, and it could offer certain customers a ""reserved vehicle"" so they could just hop in and go. where a pay-per-use company doesn't have quite the wiggle room to keep their vehicle maintenance up to date due to potential slow periods.

I've noticed that a large amount of responders are concerned that this proposal is going to limit an individual's right to own their car. While it will eventually discourage ownership, it certainly isn't going to outlaw it. That would be like saying you can't buy dvds because netflix and redbox exist (I am aware of the flaws in the analogy, but it's the closest real world scenario that I can think of). The ""rental"" service won't stop you from going to your nearest dealership and picking up some vehicle, but it will discourage it, due to pricing, and not having to perform maintenance by yourself.

No.  People will send their cars to park at home rather than spend the money to park at the airport.  That way their car can be used by their family too.

Why would I want to leave my car at the airport unusable by my family?  Even if I live alone, I still would rather send the car home than park there.

&gt;Why would airports allow passanger owned driverless vehicles on the premises?

Why wouldn't they?  If the state allows them, why would the airports not?

Well. There are lots of companies where information of their users was actually published (either for payment or because of hacks). Google has yet to have such a breach. I almost have the feeling that my personal data is more safe at Google than on my own computer.

&gt;There are plenty of companies operating on the ""we make awesome software"" business model, Google isn't special in that regard.

But Google isn't just making good producs, it has a very open ecosystem. For example you can use their api's like google maps to create very useful apps for your website. They support opensource projects, they even opensource parts/algorithms of their products for everyone to use.

Also for example Google has yet to sue some company first over software patents, while oracle does it while it stops making open source projects it gets its hands on.

Adobe was creating a lock-in with their flash. The support for anything other than Windows is absolutely horrible and instead of giving out the source so things can get better we are stuck with sloppy and dangerous (security) software. Google has pushed chrome to move to open standards and even opensourced it.

They also do really innovative research like the self-driving car and google glasses.

Adobe and Oracle are clearly making as much money as possible while Google is still making great products. ",1343851398,c5mq1sn,t1_c5lg0px,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011
39,com2kid,"&gt; For example you can use their api's like google maps to create very useful apps for your website. 

You can do the same with Bing Maps. Amazon has a ton of web services, as do lots of other companies. Terms of use vary dramatically from company to company, which means it is possible to find a service that fits individual needs.

&gt; They support opensource projects, they even opensource parts/algorithms of their products for everyone to use.

[Microsoft does the same thing](http://www.bitcrazed.com/post/2012/03/28/Microsoft-wakes-up-to-Open-Source-%E2%80%A6-in-a-big-way!.aspx). This is no longer the 1990s, tons of companies are open sourcing their stuff. 

Heck, MS has open sourced an entire [embedded operating environment](http://netmf.codeplex.com/). (Not quite an OS :-D )

Adobe also open sourced their [ES4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamarin_%28JavaScript_engine%29) engine, which would've been slightly more useful if Ecma Script 4 had ever gone through.

&gt; Adobe was creating a lock-in with their flash. 

And Googles attempts with NaCL are much in the same vein.

I'll also add that it is not ""lock-in"" if people willingly choose to buy into a platform and built apps on it! 

Just because an API or a framework is Open Source doesn't automatically make it any easier to transition away from it. For some projects greater transparency into the underlying foundation means extracting data out can be easier (versus some proprietary database BS), but for other projects the code is all that matters and code rewrites take time, but they aren't ""lock-in"". (If you buy into some companies custom language it may be a royal PITA, but that was your choice!)

Flash has been, for many purposes and for many years, the best choice for doing multimedia web content. Online games, video, voice and video chat, all sorts of nice stuff that Flash does a very good job at.

Now I agree Adobe needs to learn how to secure their apps, no doubt about it. Flash is a giant security hole that someone seemingly drives a tank through every few months. But in terms of the dev and art tools, it is pretty damn good for web content.

&gt; They also do really innovative research like the self-driving car and google glasses.

Which is awesome, but again a lot of companies are doing the same thing. Google just gets better billing for theirs, and I will admit they have some grand visions of what the future should look like and the courage to commit resources to those visions.

But none of this really matters, because

&gt; Well. There are lots of companies where information of their users was actually published (either for payment or because of hacks). Google has yet to have such a breach. I almost have the feeling that my personal data is more safe at Google than on my own computer.

Data breaches suck, Google appears to have their act together, that is great. But it doesn't detract from the point that Google's primary source of revenue is using and selling your data.

Google is, at any point in time, one upper management re-org away from being a very scary company.

I will again state, I do not want any one company controlling the entire internet end to end. At that point, online free speech is based upon one companies terms of service. Not to mention the governing laws of whatever country that company is based in.

Competition is always good. A benevolent dictatorship may work out a wee bit better for awhile, but it always falls apart in the end.

40,Sidewinder77,"Personlly I would have no problem if 50% of the land were used by cities and roads, and 50% were left open.

The total land use in the US by cities and roads is currently [~3-5%](http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/eib-economic-information-bulletin/eib89.aspx). The rest is open timberland, farmland, swamp, or tundra.

[Sky Cites](http://nextbigfuture.com/2012/06/sky-city-will-be-over-seven-times.html) (manufactured skyscrapers) could allow much cheaper densification of humans in cities and perhaps someday as the process is increasingly automated, vertical farms could become economically viable reducing the need to use very much land for farming.",1344001465,c5nl58a,t3_xm0b8,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011
41,ItsAConspiracy,"I agree, and think it could happen.

I recently read a [book](http://www.amazon.com/Whole-Earth-Discipline-Ecopragmatist-Manifesto/dp/0670021210/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344004746&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=steward+brand) by Stewart Brand, and one thing he talked about was urbanization. It's a huge worldwide trend, and in most societies urban populations have birth rates lower than replacement. World population is likely to head sharply downward starting around 2050.

Meanwhile we're getting better at making [denser cities](http://nextbigfuture.com/2012/06/how-sky-cities-and-robotic-cars-will.html), with self-driving cars and [personal rapid transit](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/5/planId/15207) grids. And in China, they're [starting](http://nextbigfuture.com/2012/06/sky-cities-will-make-healthier-cleaner.html) to [build](http://nextbigfuture.com/2012/06/china-sky-cities-trying-for-clean-and.html) huge skyscrapers that are practically cities in themselves.

Another factor is energy. We could coat vast areas with solar panels and windmills, but that's not exactly the vision you're seeing. But we could also go with more compact sources. There are [advanced](http://bravenewclimate.com/category/ifr-fad/) nuclear power [designs](http://energyfromthorium.com/) that are a hundred times more fuel-efficient, produce a hundred times less nuclear waste for the same power, and are a lot safer than conventional designs. [Nuclear](http://www.alternative-energy-action-now.com/polywell-fusion.html) [fusion](http://nextbigfuture.com/2011/08/helion-energy-general-fusion-and-tri.html) is [surprisingly](https://life.llnl.gov/why_life/life_advantages.php) [close](http://lawrencevilleplasmaphysics.com/) to [fruition](http://energy.aol.com/2012/07/19/nuclear-fusion-this-is-the-adventure-part-of-venture-capital/#page2?icid=apb2), too. (That's five links not three, each a different approach.)

But the big land-eater is farming. People talk about farming in skyscrapers, but I ran some [numbers](http://focusfusion.org/index.php/forums/viewthread/1044/#9646) on that...converting everything to indoor farming would take 125 terawatts and a million square indoor kilometers. Current world energy production is 17 terawatts. 

However, if you can synthesize food calories directly with say, 25% efficiency, instead of growing plants, you can get by with 3 terawatts. A guy who [presented](http://www.wesolveforx.com/#t=t&amp;n=ee7350c5) at Google's Solve for X is working on that, and says he can make cheap, super-healthy food that tastes like it's as sugary and fatty as you want, and he can feed the world with an area the size of Rhode Island. It'd at least work for packaged and fast food, and the indoor farms are perfect for the organic produce market...no pesticides, no need for tasteless tomatoes that can survive long transport.

And of course, with cheap fusion or fission we won't need biofuels anymore. There are a lot of people working on making liquid hydrocarbons from CO2 in the air, assuming we haven't converted to electric. The energy cost of getting carbon from the air is only about tenth the energy content of the fuel. (See the ""fuel from air"" section [here](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/5/planId/15204), and the references [here](http://climatecolab.org/web/guest/plans/-/plans/contestId/7/planId/15301).)

Sometimes what we've already got could work much better, if we just put some damn effort forth. Most people my age are awful drivers, they putt around in automatic appliance cars whose functioning they are totally ignorant of. I think that driver education in the United States should be more about learning how the car handles under adverse conditions, and handling at the limit, than just about what road sign means what and learning all the obscure regulations about when you can do what sort of passing maneuver and whatnot. I think it should also be a lot harder to get a driver's license, and I think that people should have to be aggressively re-tested every five years.

During drivers education in Finland, for instance, you have to spend time on a skidpad, learning how what a skid actually feels like and how to control it. A significant portion of the course is devoted to learning how the car *actually fucking works*, rather than treating it like a black box with two pedals and a steering wheel that magically conveys you to your destination when you put magic juice in it and point it the right way.

Other emerging safety technologies can go a long way towards making driving safer, for drivers/passengers and pedestrians alike. Stuff like lane departure warning systems, pedestrian sensing autobrake stuff, etc. A lot of this stuff is becoming very common on luxury cars and gradually filtering down. The Euro NCAP crash test ratings will, next year, require a pedestrian autobrake feature in order to get a five-star crash rating, for instance.

In short, cars are already getting a lot safer. I think that the self-driving cars represent an unnecessary step, further in the direction of Americans refusing to take some fucking responsibility for the two-ton hunk of metal they're hurtling down the highway.

In a self-driving car this stuff would necessary have to all be connected together, with a drive by wire (non-mechanical) throttle and electric power steering, all actuated by a central computer.

By the end of the century, humans live in dense, very tall cities, connected by extremely fast trains in evacuated tubes. The biosphere has taken a big hit, but finally it's recovering.

Fusion also makes a great rocket. We've got cheap access to space, using both rockets and even cheaper options like launch loops. We can get to Mars in a month. With food synthesis and fusion power, supporting a colony is easy.

Meanwhile medical technology and AI are making huge leaps, but I'll leave it to others to talk Singularity.

**Pessimistic:** we don't figure out fusion. Fossil fuels remain the cheapest energy source and we burn them all. The entire ecosystem collapses, and so does civilization. Billions of people die. What's left of our species is small scattered bands, near the poles, re-learning how to live without technology. If we're really unlucky, we get another [anoxic event](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anoxic_event), and the oceans emit vast amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas, poisoning life on land and severely damaging the ozone layer.

56,LibertyTerp,"I don't think this is quite right. Here is our possible near future.

5 years: Everyone but old people have smart phones that are as powerful as today's PCs. You pay for everything with your phone, not a credit card. In most places, you have your drivers license on your phone and it can unlock your house and your car but only using your voice (or someone else's voice who is pre-programmed). So you really have no reason to carry anything else.

Smart glasses are becoming more popular in big cities and among the upper middle class. The first launch was considered ""dorky"" but a simple fashionable redesign and the ability to transition from indoor to outdoor lenses made them a very sought after item. They can do almost everything a smart phone can do without the need to carry a phone and with many apps that only work well on smart glasses. People with smart glasses make fun of how stupid people look staring down at a black box (their smart phone) all the time. For the first time in a long time you don't need to carry anything in your pockets.

Robotic mowers have just become available, but are expensive. They can be directed manually for steep hills and tight areas. 

Refrigerators that record what you have and order a weekly shopping list delivered to you automatically become popular. You set up a list of everything you should have in your fridge. The refrigerator uses the same image recognition technology as self-driving cars to determine what you have in your fridge and orders what you don't have once a week or when you tell it to.

Speaking of self-driving cars, Google created a driverless taxi company that operates in most major metro areas that is gradually killing old fashioned taxis. They simply charge half as much because they don't have to pay someone's wages and the taxi itself uses less gas because it isn't driving around all the time. The taxi just parks in a high demand area with no taxis nearby after it drops someone off and waits for someone to use the Google Taxi App to call it. People in urban areas start buying much fewer cars because Google taxi is much cheaper. One taxi services dozens of people a day rather than having your own personal car sitting idle 95% of the time - far more efficient.

You can also buy a driverless car, although they are very new. Most owners of driverless cars rent their car out for a portion of the day when they won't need it to earn money using their car as a Google Taxi.

69,[deleted],"But there must be some processing going on somewhere within the neural network, right?

E.g google built a facial recognition algorithm for recognizing cats in youtube videos recently. In order for the neural network to know when it correctly identified a cat and when it didn't, there must be some code somewhere which tells it whether or not it correctly identified a cat.

That same code could be used to put in place some restrictions or rules in place that will not allow the AI to harm humans, etc.

&gt; If you have programmers that are 10-20 times better, and demand the same money, you should be able to print money. 

No you couldn't. It doesn't only take a great programmer to make money. It takes marketing, brand recognition, patents, a lot of other non-programming related activities which have nothing to do with how good your code is written.

The computing complexity required to land curiosity in the mars (which is far different than landing apollo on the moon), analyzing the rocks there, etc is indeed more complex than Windows, or at least at the same level of complexity.

Apart from Windows, we now have self driving cars, google has been working on them amongst others, and google has driven something like 500k miles with self driven cars, with only one accident that was human caused. Driving a car, being aware of your surroundings, all the cars' systems, etc is definitely much more complex than Windows.

Landing a rover on mars is not very complex, you have a desired flight path, you have actions available to stay inside that flight path.

A neural net is good for recognizing patterns and things like that. It could be used for such things.

That's such an unrealistic scenario and completely unlikely to happen, that it makes me think that you're just talking out of your ass.

1) First off, no 'cure' that the AI comes up will just get spread all over the world without any testing .When any new medicine comes up, it is tested thoroughly for a few years, starting with animal trials, then humans, and only if its proven safe is it then allowed to be administered to public.

Say that somehow this AI was able to accidently produce something that cures cancer but then kills the person, this would first be tested, and detected as being fatal, and hence killed, the AI would be told to discard it.

2) Since the AI's decision making module is programmed quite clearly that any decision which harms humans would be discarded, there's no way that a cure which results in human death would be allowed to pass the decisions module.

3) There can be a separate neural network which calculates the effects of a certain decision, and the decision module would wait for the results of this network before making its decision. Hence even if something were to kill humans in 100 years, its neural network for calculating the effects ought to find that and report that to the decisions module, which will then discard it in accordance with the rules it has been programmed with.

&gt; How can you say Google has brand problems

This is a completely pointless discussion which has nothing to do with what we were talking about. You were saying that Microsoft windows is the most complicated piece of software ever made.

It hasn't been tested robustly enough yet to be able to claim that its 100% bug free. However in the testing done so far, there's only been one accident which was a result of human error.

As of now the driver can retake control of the vehicle instantly, very similar to cruise control.  Nevada's law allowing self-driving cars requires human drivers to be in the driver's seat at all times ready to take control of the car if necessary.

We use computers for things like air traffic control and nuclear weapons and damn near everything these days.  Precautions are needed but this isn't enough of a reason to avoid the technology.  

&gt;(Google licensed only? How will other repair shops adapt with such a marginal grouping of machinery? How many body shops will lose employees due to inability to support this?)

Google isn't the only company that is developing this technology.  Cars will still have mechanical parts that will need servicing and mechanics will either learn to fix the on board computers or that will be left to computer technicians.  If anything this could lead to more jobs, not fewer.  

&gt;how will roads need to adapt?

Not much at all.  These cars are driving on modern day roads without problem.  The technology can already detect and decipher road signs.  And unlike human drivers, they never miss a sign.  

&gt;What is the price of that/How do you intend to fund it when states can barely upkeep pavement.

This technology will greatly reduce traffic since cars will be able to drive closer to each another and intersections can be managed more effectively.  It is estimated that far fewer new roads will be required which will save all of us a lot of money.

&gt;Further, watching this video, the streets are dead, the car is barely breaking 25. 

This is but one video.  I assure you that they are road testing these cars in dangerous situations.  I live next to a very dangerous highway where accidents are very frequent.  I have personally seen the self-driving car navigating on my highway.  If I'm not mistaken, one of the cars drove from California all the way to Florida.  

&gt;and what is the blind driver to do in such an event?

At first these cars will be for people that can currently drive.  As the technology advances it will eventually be safe to have driverless cars for blind drivers and, believe it or not, sometimes they will be cruising around with NOBODY inside of the car.  Imagine having your pizza delivered by a car and nothing else!  Again, that is not in the near future when drivers will still be required.

94,ExoticCarMan,"Well downloading and locally storing (in the car) bits of Google Maps would be necessary for some locations where network connection is bad, such as driving up a mountain. However, I'd imagine downloading all of Google Maps would consume an atrocious amount of data. Even if you were to download only your country's map, it would most likely still be a vast download, especially if you lived in a larger country, such as the US; if you lived in a smaller country, downloading your surrounding countries' maps would be a prime idea. Then again, the ubiquity of self-driving cars would certainly be years from now, if it were to happen, so perhaps downloading and locally storing full maps would be possible, given the rapid decline of the physical size and cost of data storage and the simultaneous rapid incline of storage capacity. Although I'd imagine nice features, such as street view, satellite view, and 3D maps, would be limited to network-connected cars, or at least initially.

However, no matter what amount of data it would cost to locally store maps (and whether storing that would be possible) is trumped by a completely different conundrum — the stored maps could be outdated. If all of America is downloaded to your car, and you haven't updated your map in a week, there could be a construction site that you could literally run into. Therefore, you would have to update your car daily/nightly, in order to have the most recent information, which is essential for driving. That means that all of that data — the map your entire state, providence, country, or however large of an area you choose — would have to be downloaded *every day*. Now, if you knew you weren't going to travel halfway across the US the next day, you could just download your local area, but either way it will be a large daily download. Natheless, even if you were to just get your local area, you wouldn't have the exact minute road stats, such as traffic, accidents, weather, etcetera.

So, unfortunately, downloading where your driving on-the-spot will be necessary in the majority of cases. Of course, that has its problems too. Network jams would become much more frequent. This is also assuming [The Spectrum Crunch](http://money.cnn.com/technology/spectrum-crunch) doesn't get us in the mean time.

96,nosoupforyou,"&gt;You say there would still be taxi and truck drivers, but your arguments for them justify truck owners. 

Hmmm. I'm not making myself clear.  I'm saying taxi drivers will still own their own taxis, just not have to spend time behind the wheels.

And truck drivers, *eventually*, will go away.  There will be some independent truck owners but not as many as now.  But this won't be for much much longer, simply due to all of the additional duties truck drivers have to do besides actually driving.  Verifying shipments, getting signatures, loading/unloading, and probably more.

&gt;The market would probably be dominated by people owning floats of self-driven trucks, since you save on the driver's salary.

I doubt if it will come down to a few people owning large fleets.  I think most trucks will be owned by the relative business (ups owning ups trucks, mcdonalds owning mcdonalds trucks, etc).  But there will be some individuals that work independently.

Truck rentals for moving, for example.  I can see lots of small companies owning a dozen or so trucks that they rent out just like today. Or independent truckers that, just like today, take shipping contracts for companies that just don't want to get into owning trucks.

Joe's shipping, Pete's Packaging, etc.

&gt;As long as there will be massive traffic along predictable lines, there will be an advantage to mass transportation. They'd simply switch to self-driven buses.

I disagree.  The problem with *mass* transportation is exactly what self-driving vehicles defeat.  Mass transportation such as buses mean YOU wait on the transportation's schedule and YOU have to take whatever preplanned route it has. 

The only advantage to a bus over a car is that a bus is more efficient because it only has to cover the one driver's salary. Get rid of that driver, and there's absolutely no efficiency advantage anymore.  Why? Because buses aren't always full.  If you try to limit it to only full buses, then you increase the inconvenience for your passengers.  Quite often buses are entirely empty except for the driver.  I'd doubt if even averaging out an entire day's rides that you would even get a half full average.

Their might be a few routes for a few hours where it might be worth it.   If a lot of people get off a train and happen to be going to the same general area.  But I expect that to be very limited.

I used to ride a bus like that. I'd get off at a certain stop just before downtown, and hop onto the bus to take me to my office.  The bus would always be full.  But too often everyone would get soaked or frozen in winter or have to wait 20 minutes because the bus was late.  But it was preferable to going all the way downtown and waiting for the bus there, or worse yet paying a taxi.

But with JohnnyCabs, taxis should be far cheaper since they won't have to cover a driver's time.  If we had them today, I'd pick the JohnnyCab over the bus.",1346649475,c62oels,t1_c62mmcb,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011

The spaceship, in terms of the space immediately around it, is not moving, has a velocity and acceleration of 0, suffers non of the relativistic speed issues we currently see with proposed FTL or lighthugging technology.

102,SanguineDreamer,"It is absolutely plausible. One reason that you see life expectancy leveling out is because we have made vast progress on many of the illnesses and other great killers of the past, and are now experiencing new illnesses that affect older people. Hunger and the common cold kill relatively few people in the developed world. But these older people are still subject to cancer, Alzheimer’s, and heart disease. 

So basically think of life expectancy as a series of s-curves. We are near the top of an s-curve now, and it will grow once medicine is able to better treat the common killers of today. Also keep in mind that there are other things besides disease that kill (car accidents being one). Because of this, there will always be a compression of the true longevity graph. At least until we solve these issues as well. (Self driving cars for example will lead to a vast increase in life expectancy as car accidents become a thing in the past.)

The population argument seems like it would be a valid argument against life extension, but breaks down when exposed to historical data. There is a clear trend to women having fewer children as technology, industrialization, medicine, and lifespan increase. There are many reasons for this that I will not go into here, but the implications are clear. As we live longer, less of us are born. You can look at many projections of future population, with a figure between 8-12 billion being the most common leveling point. 

You can also look at it from an ecological perspective. The carrying capacity (k) of the environment will only let a certain number of individuals survive due to resource scarcity. As the population level approaches the carrying capacity you see a clear slowing of population growth. The only worry here is that population will push past k so that a population crash ensues. 

Yet a third refutation of the overpopulation argument is that technology is poised to vastly expand the level of resources available to us. The book ""Abundance - the future is better than you think"" does a great job at explaining the approaching post scarcity world. The basic argument here is that technology will increase K faster than humans add population. When taken with the slowing of fertility it is clear that the overpopulation argument is no longer valid.

109,CthulhusCallerID,"Excellent questions and points. I'm going to go one at a time.

&gt;How do you feel about the cost of automation versus human production? Do you think that there's a breaking point where it's cheaper to have humans do a task rather than automating something (especially once technology has created a surplus in the human labor pool)?

I think the breaking point will be when the price of an automated system costs less than 1/4 of the annual salary of the worker(s) that it replaces (with some deference to costs beyond salary, such as political backlash, union opposition, special taxes, etc). A lot of companies use their quarterly performance as the metric for determine success. So if a manger's bonus is tide to the quarterly profits, even if automation will save them money over the course of a few years, they may not rush to invest in it. 

Now, that's not to say they won't be investing in some automation, they'll likely already be investing in automation rather than hiring new workers, and new businesses that compete in the field will be more relent on automation than established companies until that price point is crossed. Then the economic pressure to replace humans with systems will be too great because all of a company's incentives (with the possible exceptions of political pressure and consumer boycotts) are lined up on one side.

&gt;I think of Walmart as an example. Sure there could be machines stocking shelves, cleaning up, etc. but the initial capital investment in retrofitting a store for that seems significant.

You're probably right about Walmart, but a Walmart employee may still be replaced by automation even if it's not a case where they've been fired by Walmart. 

Consider Amazon's recent statement that they're going to increase their number of warehouses in every state so they can offer same day delivery. On its face, it'd seem like they're going to need to hirer warehouse workers and drivers, but Amazon also bought a company (I think for $750 million) that specializes in automated warehouse solutions. They invest in self driving trucks, and potentially now they only need to hire a man to run it from the truck to your door.

Walmart has an incredibly efficient supply chain, but their model may not be sustainable against competition from Amazon's. Whether or not Walmart employees in particular avoid automation, you can still see how workers will compete against automation both directly and indirectly. 

&gt;At some point does the upkeep on a human become cheaper than the upkeep on a machine? It seems like this would at least keep the lower levels of the economy going.

Perhaps for windows of time. Changes in how well we can grow, process, and transport food may make it cheaper than supplying systems with power, but the humans would also need power for both their support tools (computers, elevators, lights, AC and heat-- though machines presently need to be kept from over heating as well, so that may not be a slam dunk in terms of savings). Vertical farming and artificial meat may bring the price of food way down, but I suspect practical sustainable energy to hit first, this will reduce one of the most substantial upkeep costs of automated systems.

As for colonization of other planets, there's a problem. They're going to have a technology on a par with our technology, at least to the point where they left, by virtue of the fact that they came directly from our society. When English textiles started to sell their blankets to Indians, part of why that worked was because the Indians did not have textiles of their own yet. It seems plausible that the human colony on Mars will have the same automation that we have. We may swap commodities, but this is also an expensive idea that will leave most people out (interplanetary shipping). 

Market expansion will be linked to population growth, which will be constrained by supplies sent from Earth until those planets are terraformed or we're able to colonize (and trade with) habitable planets. I'm skeptical we'll be out of our solar system before we have human level AI and even more skeptical that we'll have large populations on other planets (&gt;100 thousand people) within our solar system before we've already had to deal with capitalism failing.

Now, there's one more thing I want to expand on. Human Level AI isn't required to get human level outputs. When we talk about knowledge workers, these are people who generally have a very specific field that they're examining. There's some experiments that suggest the more training it takes for a human to perform a task well, the easier it is to automate. 

We can also consider that we don't need to automate things away on a one for one basis. A system doesn't need to do everything that a secretary can do, if it can do some of the things a secretary can do, then the office building needs less total secretaries. And if six systems can do virtually all of the day to day activities of a secretary, and these systems, in total, cost less than the total quarterly salary of all of the office's secretaries, then you may see all of the secretaries replaced. 

To put it another way, I have a friend who loves Shakespeare. Goes to the shows, reads the plays, reads biographies and histories and critical works about Shakespeare, can not get enough of the Bard. His profession, though, has nothing to do with Shakespeare. He's a lawyer who specialized in contract law. He's pretty open that most of his job could be performed by IBM's Watson.

Watson does not possess human level intelligence. It can quote Hamlet, yet can't sympathize with the prince's struggles. But Watson's inability to appreciate Shakespeare doesn't mean it couldn't dramatically reduce the number of billable hours my friend can rack up for his law firm. He will still have work to do, but now one whole category of task is almost entirely off his plate and the time he spent doing it, will be dedicated to the other tasks that took up much less of his time.

If the law firm isn't billing as many hours, they're not going to retain all of their staff (at least, not at the same wages they're being paid now). Some lawyers will remain and now all they'll be doing are these other tasks, but the firm could potentially need 1/10th the total lawyers in his division. 

So a non-human level AI able to produce a human level outcome in a narrowly defined task can still replace a human worker, even a highly trained specialist.

Anyway, it's not that I'm necessarily right about all of these things, or even that I'm remotely correct about any of them, it's that these are potentially destabilizing inventions and we need to consider how best to head off problems before they become too serve and too systemic. My biggest concern is that everyone is looking a thousand years out and saying ""everything is going to be fantastic"" and not considering how bad things may get for, say, 10-15 years forty years from now.",1348723891,c6e2nla,t1_c6du9rv,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011

111,Houshalter,"I believe it was discussed in one of the other threads on self-driving cars that it would make car sharing practical. When you are done with your car it drives itself back to a central facility for maintenance and refueling and then goes and services the next person who needs a car. You would order one to come before you plan to leave. A few might be driving around nearby or parked so you wouldn't have to wait long.

Hybrids and electric cars would be more practical because even though they cost more, since they would be in use nearly non stop, they would get more miles and thus pay for themselves quicker. Also, for electric, if you plan on travelling for longer than the battery life you could always switch off with another car at some point. The last advantage I can think of would be the ability to drive much slower under normal circumstances. You can do a lot of things in your car that you can in your home or office so getting places quickly isn't as much of a concern. That increases your safety and decreases the amount of energy it takes.",1348808696,c6ek2mc,t3_10j2rk,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011
112,CthulhusCallerID,"Part 2: Just about your last paragraph.

Now this bit excited me: 

&gt;Also, remember that an AI that is a proper superset of humanity in terms of capabilities is a very tall order indeed. If we make a computer that can drive a car, that's a big advancement, but while we will probably reach this point one day, it's rather harder to make a robot that you can love as a wife, or to make a computer that can provide an entertaining talk with you on Reddit.

OK, so I kinda want to tease you a little bit, but since tone is hard to convey, I just want to be clear that this is a friendly sort of teasing- we have a self driving car, and it just became street legal in California! Google’s got one, the Germans have one in the works and a group out of somewhere in Northern Europe (I think Sweden but I'm not sure) has been testing car to car communication as a way of allowing people to not drive, they form road trains where only the lead car is being driven. This could further improve safety of self driving cars if they're all networked together sharing information on speed location and obstacles.

But the part I really want to talk about is the robot wife. While this has little to do with my speculations on the economy, it aligns neatly with one of my favorite things to read about: story telling strategies. I propose to you that, even knowing the robot isn’t insentient (if it isn’t a true intelligence), most people would still be able to fall in love with a sufficiently attractive and emotive automaton.

Take my brother for example. I worshiped him growing up. He was not the kind of older brother that beet you up, or made fun of you, he always had my back. I can’t count the number of times he stood up for me in school (I was always nerdy and kind of undersized). He’s just such a good guy. Anyway, the reason I brought him up, and I don’t like broadcasting this, is because he has cancer. For a while we were really worried about how we were going to pay for his treatment. He was way too sick to work and he wasn’t getting any assistance for being a veteran (Marine during Desert Storm). To make it worse, because of the kind of cancer that he has and what he was doing while in Iraq, we think he developed after he was exposed to some chemical agents. 

He’s doing better now, we’ve managed to get him into this clinical trial, but he’s all the way on the other side of the country. The cancer and the treatments have really done a number on him, and even though we think he’s turned a corner, he looks like hell and he’s having trouble getting anyone to talk to him socially. 

I would give anything to be able to send him a robot that looked like a person and could emulate being nice to him even if there was no mind behind its actions. And I’m going to explain why I think it would make a difference. 

People are social animals, we long for contact with other humans. There are all kinds of studies on the dangers of isolation and the importance of touch. A person in a community lives longer than a person in isolation. This extends outward though beyond just people. You may have seen the stories on the Japanese nursing homes that brought in a robotic seal and how well the seniors responded to it. Or you may have just observed how much people love and care for their pets. This is an important extension of that concept. We’re social, but there some elasticity in our minds that allow us to be social towards other creatures too.

Now the Japanese seniors are not senile, they know that the seal isn’t even an animal, let alone a sentient being, but their treating it like one has produced a similar response in their brain to an actual interaction with a pet. Reduced signs of loneliness, less stress, better mood, etc. Part of the reason for that stems from different areas of the brain being responsible for different things. What is ‘known’ to the neocortex, may not be totally relevant to (and I’m not a neurologist, so these are probably not the actual areas involved) whether or not signals that it’s safe to relax are being sent out by the pelvic splanchnic nerves. 

You can see this elsewhere. Like with pornography, men know that what they’re seeing is just colored light on their computer monitor, but they’re having a similar reaction to if the images was real and in the room with them. This is because the neocortex doesn’t stop the signal from reaching parasympathetic nervous system. And the list goes on and on (if you’ve ever been scared during a horror movie even though you were in no danger).

In other words, our brains are a nest of heuristic responses which can be readily tricked even if we’re aware that we’re simply responding to a stimulus. Even though I know that the person star isn’t in the room (and even if she was, she probably wouldn’t be lusting for me), I’m still going to get horny seeing the image of her. And even though the seniors knew that beneath the “seal’s” “fur” was nothing but plastic and wires, they responded to it as if it were a pet. 

So this is part one of my argument for why I want to send a robot to keep my brother company. Even if you know that something isn’t the real thing, it can still trick your brain into respond in the same, or remarkably similar, way it would for the real thing.

I read a feminist text once where the author asked, “What does Beauty mean?” She wasn’t looking for the definition, she was just asking ‘what does it signify? Why is attraction, and by extension, attractiveness so important to us?’ 

The best guest psychologists have is that it relates to signals that a mate is 1) healthy and 2) in their reproductive prime. Right now robots are in the uncanny valley. Most people wouldn’t really find them attractive exactly, but at the same time, in Japan there’s a thriving business where realistic looking sex dolls are rented at prices *higher* than the average prostitute. 

If we can get robots to the point where aesthetically they’re passing as human, then we can expect that the mechanisms in our brains that tell us whether or not we find someone attractive will be triggered. Even knowing that the object of our lust is a robot, shouldn’t be much of a detriment to how attractive we find it. For evidence of this, think of augmented breasts. We know they are not real breasts, we know that they really don’t indicate anything about the woman’s genes or ability for her to care for her young, yet they still trigger our brains to send out the message that this is a good candidate for mating. 

(Actually, that’s another good example. We lust so that we will mate and reproduce, but if don’t consciously want a child, that doesn’t mean we stop experiencing lust, it means we take a pill, use a condom, pull out, etc.)  

But not being lonely is a far cry from being in love. (And I’m not sure I’d buy my brother a wife just yet. I’m sure, knock on wood, once this is behind him, he’ll be back to the same old handsome devil he used to be.) 

It seems magical, but like virtually everything else, love is product of material processes. In Brain-Trust, Churchland hypothesizes that all bonding may have mutated from parental bonding. She talks about the brain chemistry involved and about how inhibiting certain neurotransmitters in the brains of voles can change their mating behavior, making them either more promiscuous or more likely to pair bound (there is infidelity even among the control pair bonding species but the affect was significant).

Meanwhile Helen Fisher looked at the brains response to various love states. The early stages of love, the heart break of having just been dumped, and a couple in long state of attachment. At its core were neurotransmitters, at least one of which was the same transmitter at the center of the voles mating behavior. 

In other words, if all else fails we could manipulate the levels of dopamine in a persons brain directly or indirectly and induce bonding with virtually anything. If every time the robot in question walked into the room, it sent a signal to the brain of its owner/husband to produce more dopamine and the rest of the cocktail in the right areas of the brain, then the owner/husband would experience attachment to the robot that felt like any other romantic attachment they’d ever felt.

But I doubt we’d even need to resort to that sort of trick. I think you can get someone to feel love for a robot, even knowing it’s a robot, without tinkering with their brain beyond employing tricks storytellers have known for hundreds of years.

In movies and books, authors and film makers often times set out to make their main characters sympathetic because they know this is a good way to draw the reader/viewer along. One of the easiest ways is to prey on our social instincts. The cliché is, there’s a dog sitting outside of a saloon, cowboy walks up, pets the dog and heads inside. That’s your hero. Another cowboy walks up, kicks the dog out of his way, and boom, you’ve got your villain. 

The first cowboy demonstrated that he cares about others, the second that he does not. Now this was a real quick and dirty example of how we can get people to care about a representation of a person that doesn’t actually exist. But if you’ve ever liked a book or a show, chances are you’ve experienced first hand caring about “someone” who only exists as words on a page or a performance on a screen. *HARRY POTTER SPOILER ALERT* If you felt sad when Dumbledore or Doby died, but felt little the last time you heard on the news that a car accident had a fatality, that’s because JK Rowling (and in the films, a whole host of people) gave you enough little chunks for your brain to create a mental representation of a person, and enough social cues for you decide that you liked that person and cared about what happened to them, meanwhile the news report just told you that there was a car accident in which someone died.

113,keyofg,"First it will simply be something like *cruise control plus*. Everything else will be the same as it is now, except you get a little extra break after engaging cruise control on the interstate. This will be great after waking up super early to drive between cities, or during the boring part of your commute. Hands-free driving and nothing more. This is how it will first be legalized: on limited access highways, for convenience and safety.

When it gets a little busy, or the weather starts to get bad, you take matters into your own hands, just as you would now. It would be the responsible thing to do.

But then one day, a truck unexpectedly cuts you off while your cruising hands free down the highway. You will have no time to react! You helplessly observe in terror as your car reacts immediately to the situation and saves your life.

After that, you change your habits. Now when it gets busy, or the weather gets bad, you are more inclined to let the car drive you. You will feel safer to leave things of chance to your onboard computer, and so too will many others.

As more and more people realize their lives are being saved instead of put at risk by self-driving cars, driving without assistance will be as taboo as not wearing a seat-belt.  Self-driving cars will be introduced as an option of convenience, but will in this way become the law.",1348861737,c6etbqi,t3_10mupn,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011
114,skawesome,"I think things are moving faster than you realize. Nevada and California have already passed legislation allowing self-driving cars, while several others are considering it. Right now, several automakers have cars on the road with cruise control that allows you to set a distance from the cars in front of you (which will adjust when you get cut off), cars that will break when detecting obstacles ahead, and park themselves.

I know a lot of people who won't want to give up control. There are times when I enjoy driving, and would want to have that option in the future. The biggest hurdle is people's (not unjustified) mistrust for technology, and concerns that these cars wouldn't be very good drivers. Having been driving in a major city for several years now, it's not hard to assure people it doesn't take much for a car to be a better driver than the average person on the road.

That's a major bonus in selling self-driving cars: most people think they're good drivers, and everyone else sucks. It's easy to stroke their egos and say ""well, this car may not be as good of a driver as you, but it's better than all of *them*, which is a win for everyone.""",1348865137,c6eu9c0,t1_c6etbqi,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011

I'm thinkin' that an ad campaign like [this](http://www.scenicreflections.com/files/Sexy_babe_car_Wallpaper_wsjrk.jpg) will probably do it.

116,Lorem_Ipsum,"Two things.

Firstly self driving cars are going to be statistically safer immediately or at least soon after they are available. With the exception of very bad defects, self driving cars will be 100 times safer because they will eliminate human error from driving.

Any company that has large fleets of vehicles; taxis, shipping, mail(?) will be quick to adopt them. That is probably were we are going to see them first.

Insurance companies will also be all over them because of the fewer number of accidents that there will be. 1/2, 1/4, or 1/100th the amount of accidents on the road yet everyone still has to buy insurance.

Secondly, people will be very afraid of them when there are accidents. There will be some servo motor problem, and a family of four will be driving down the road and the car will suddenly crash into a ravine killing everyone. It will be all over the news and could prevent the adoption of self driving cars completely or at least a very long time. Even though a self driving car will be 100 times safer than a human driven car, people will be wary of putting their life in the hands of a machine. And accidents that do happen will be blown way out of proportion.

The biggest threat to self driving cars is that people won't understand how and why they are safer.",1348869733,c6evfc2,t3_10mupn,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011
117,mauinion,"Speaking from my own perspective, I want one NOW. I suspect that people with old parents will want them to have one right away. Also people with disabilities will want one right away. Now add alcoholics, rich teens, and taxis...

This is already a huge marketplace, but then throw in Pizza delivery, UPS man, and people that have kids but a mom who is a horrible driver, and I expect this to go through the roof at the starting line.

While I think fully autonomous cars are still close to 5 years away, I think that year by year they will become closer to reality. We already have cars that can parallel park by them self, and all the automakers are working very hard to get this to happen soon. It will happen incrementally each year from here on out. 

Next year it will be cars that manage accident avoidance (breaking, lane drift correction, etc). Then in 2014, will be highway and  interstate driving  (this will still require the driver remain alert as a copilot). 2015 will maybe have a few models that can drop you off and park, also pick you up valet style. 2016 will bring cars that will drive until bad weather happens, or in dirt roads, etc. By 2018 at the latest we will start seeing fully autonomous aftermarket kits that can be installed to your Winnebego. This is what I can't wait for. High speed fiber / ultra fast wireless networks nation wide, and I can post up in my camper and wake up each day at a new surf break, or which ever ski resort got fresh powder.

From the governments perspective, this will reduce accidents, they will be able to kill or pull over a car remotely, and reroute traffic in case of accidents or construction with a key stroke, saving them the use of policemen, and many other types of labor. Governments will be pushing this too.

Keep in mind we have the technology now for VTOL ""Jetsons"" cars that are fully autonomous.  Self driving cars are merely the stepping stone in that direction. However, that may take 15-20 years before people are not afraid of it.

Autonomous cars will be a net job killer. Think of how many people are employed by driving. All fired in 5-10 years. 

On the bright side, think about all the prime real estate that will be converted to commercial space, since people wont need to park. If you think finding a place to park in the city is hard now, try driving a  non autonomous car in 10-15 years.

120,Telsak,"**2012:** The first laws are being altered to allow for self-driving cars in numerous american states, limited trials being run by first adopters. Cars still require a licensed driver to be ready behind the wheel to take control.

**2013:** First year of car accident statistics published to the public, show a sharp decline in accidents in self-driving cars compared to regular vehicles. Sweden and Germany announce initiative to have the self-driving as a standard option for all cars on their roads by 2020. A licensed driver is still required to be ready in the car.

**2014:** The first documented case of a backdoor implemented in the operating system of one of the cars, compromising the performance and response time of the driving module. A number of accidents occur but accident statistics still show a decline in fatalities. There are now an equal number of self-driving vehicles on the roads as there are human-piloted ones. A pilot project in the US sets up specific car-lanes that are restricted to self-driving cars but allow for a much higher top speed. These lanes also allow the cars access to a closed WiFi as part of the 'perk'.

**2015:** Israel follows suit in the now much successful US project and implements a large number of lanes dedicated solely for self-driving cars but also take it a step further and retrofit the roads to allow for the automatic charging of electric-based cars that use them. The second generation hardware and software is now available to consumers, allowing a trial run of no-driver mode where no human is required to have a drivers license. The project is met with some resistance, mostly because the new models are not able to be put into manual mode unless you have a drivers license which sparks some debates about fundamental rights and emergency procedures.

**2016:** Self-driving cars is now the norm in the majority in the western nations, with the exception of a number of european countries where the infrastructure is lagging behind when it comes to building special lanes for self-driving cars. It is considered a novelty/retro thing to be driving manually. Volkswagen secretly enters a self-driving car into the yearly Dakar Rally and places second, causing quite the stir in the media. They are disqualified from the race but the PR is worth gold. It is now common knowledge that a self-driving car is well worth the investment. Accidents are at an all-time low and are mostly caused by manual drivers who are late adopters and inexperienced drivers who deliberately switch from auto to manual but even this number is declining. A number of premium options are available, mainly a number of augmented reality systems that utilize transparent OLED displays from Samsung imbedded in the sidewindows and windshield.

**2025:** Electric self-driving cars now make up for the vast majority of cars on the roads. Lanes available for manual drivers are now severely limited. No new drivers licenses are being issued in Sweden, Germany, Britain, USA, Japan among others. A tighter integration of self-driving cars with public transit systems have allowed for a decrease of vehicles on the roads due to a massive gain in efficiency of transport capacity vs cost of fuel. Access to a self-driving car is now an obvious fact, much like how the smartphones of 2012 were a standard item before lens display systems emerged.",1348883755,c6eygon,t3_10mupn,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011

Instead of just paying a fare every time, people might sign up for some kind of subscription, and I imagine it would probably become cheaper than owning a car. You would order one with your phone.

This would start to move out of cities. Even in rural areas, a few self-driving cars would be parked strategically in places where they could service dozens of houses, waiting to pick some one up the second they get a call. Parking lots would become smaller and less full, except for some centralized parking lots that would house the cars during times of low demand, and there they would be refueled/recharged and get maintenance.

124,Chronophilia,"Cars will gradually get better and better at driving themselves. It starts with things we already have - cruise control that senses the position of other cars on the motorway, cars that mostly park themselves, that sort of thing.

It'll continue in this vein for a while. Perhaps cars will detect when they are about to hit something and apply the brakes before the driver can react. Or they'll alert you if you're driving erratically and they think you're too tired or drunk to drive properly. Or the GPS will make educated guesses at where you're going, and alert you to traffic jams (perhaps even detect the warning signs of a traffic jam before one happens).

But there will be a point in the future that people can mark and say ""This is when self-driving cars were invented"". Some large auto manufacturer, in 2030 or thereabouts, will make a prototype of a car that does *everything* for you. Big advertising blitz, small-ish production run, they'll either hype it up and sell it really expensively or sell it at a loss for the sake of being known as the first guys to make a self-driving car. This car will be to self-drivers as the iPhone was to smartphones.

Of course, most of the automatic systems will have an off-switch, and it will be entirely possible to drive it manually, if you want. People take a little while to get used to the idea. A car is involved in an accident while its driver was asleep. Another one drives itself away while it's empty. The automobile companies are sued for every death that can be blamed on their software - and though they correctly argue that they also saved lives, this is difficult to quantify. The field is set back 10 years by a landmark case.

Things start to turn around in 2050. By this time, children who were born with the self-driving cars are becoming adults. Significantly, they are also old enough to get their driver's licenses. Some of them figure that they don't need a license if their car can drive itself. The law doesn't see it that way, but the idea spreads anyway. There's less and less that the driver actually needs to *do* in a car. People start proposing laws that say you don't need a qualified driver in a car at all.

What eventually gets these laws passed is, strangely enough, the military. They've been using unmanned drones for a while now, as well as wheeled robots that can recover injured soldiers from the battlefield without putting medical staff at risk. The idea of self-driving tanks has its appeal. And so, in 2060, a law is passed saying that vehicles (as long as they meet certain safety requirements) don't need to be driven by someone with a driving license. 2 years later, it is updated to say that cars can be on the road even if they aren't carrying a human at all.

This time, things go surprisingly smoothly. Hit-and-runs become almost impossible, because cars record each others' license plates and the owner's name and address is only ever a click away. A car can be registered stolen in moments, and any other car that sees it will report it immediately. Some people protest on the grounds of privacy, but everyone else stops listening when they realise you can summon your car to come and get you any time you don't feel like walking.

Trams and trains have been driverless for ages by this point - they have rails, so there's very little risk of something going wrong. Driverless buses appear, but before they can become widespread someone invents a driverless taxi service. Press a button on your phone, and the nearest taxi will instantly pick you up and take you to where you want to go.

All these driverless cars have meant that a lot of money has been sunk into the computer vision problem over the decades. By this point, computers can recognise objects as well as any human, and are far better at recognising faces. The technology also exists to make machines that can navigate any sort of terrain while carrying fragile cargo. What this all means is the beginning of the next step: robots that can walk around, pick up objects, and understand rather complex instructions.

Second, because of the above, there will actually be a ""race"" between self-driving cars and flying drones (because the computer vision problem is also the problem that plagues drones). Some people, like yann lecun and collaboraters have built real-time computer vision systems for drones that only draw a few watts of power (using fpga's). So, just as self-driving cars are about to take off, a superior technology - ""flying cars"" - are also about to take off.

The implications for the above are much greater than simply relieving the chore of driving. Brad Templeton has written about this http://www.templetons.com/brad/robocars/

In short (note that I'm making more aggressive statements than templeton likes to make) -

- you won't be owning ""small"" cars or drones, you will simply use them as taxis (some people will opt to purchase them for private use - the same people who buy mercedes's today). This will have a large effect on auto mechanics because their traditional shenanigans of fleecing consumers will be over (large fleet owning corps will hire mechanics full time - automate the process of fixing because computer vision technology is accelerating fast).

- however, many people will buy ""large"" cars or drones because many people will forego home ownership (paying rent/mortgage on a boring unmovable old-tech wooden/brick expensive heating/cooling thing called a house will look more and more like a bad deal). They will rent smaller cars/drones to get around sometimes. The effects of this on land/house/apartment prices and the associated trades will be large (construction workers/mortgage brokers/landlords/real estate sellers - all mostly out of business. This is a good thing because these people were mostly leeches on society - they weren't helping ""industrialization"").

- people won't really need to get around (shopping/chores) as much because small drones/cars will simply deliver goods. Most retailers will go out of business and direct manufacturer to consumer trade will explode (and a lot of those manufacturers will be those very same ""consumers"" as well because of 3d printing and consumer robotics like Rethink Robotics Baxter).

- fast food will change, you won't go to drive through as much - the drive-thru will come to you (for example http://tacocopter.com/). Many restuarants will close because ""localness"" they rely on will cease to be a factor to consumers. Only the best will survive. Also, because of the computer vision technology improvement (that makes self-driving cars/drones possible), a lot of cooks will be out of a job because robots can take over that role (this is a good thing because the government will be forced to retrain burger flippers to a more educated job lest they sit on the dole).

- many people will opt not to have a kitchen because ordering food will become cheap/fast (drones + robot cooks)

- many people will opt not to own a bathtub/hottub/shower. Bathrooms will become self-driving/flying 
self-cleaning appliances that you rent as needed for the hour. You can then also choose to have different style (luxury hot tub) whenever you want it and the chores of cleaning/maintenance will be removed. People will still choose to have a toilet nearby at all times (you need it quick sometimes) but it will also be mobile (to send away for cleaning/maintenance/upgrading/choosing different styles).

- the above principle also applies to other appliances (dryer/washer/ac/boiler/fridge /diy tools etc).

- the structure of schools/offices will change. People will opt to hold meetings/classes in open fields, sometimes in little podcars, like the old drive-in theaters.

- hospitals/doctors/nurses will be affected.
 The Raven telerobotic surgeon http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPk90YCpqFg will come to your house (instead of you going to the hospital). It will also be automated (because of rapid improvement in computer vision that are occuring). The same holds for doctors - see this interview with famed venture capitalist Vinod Khosla http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTcCkzrjNLY and the qualcomm X prize http://www.qualcommtricorderxprize.org/

There's a whole other discussion about the what drones will do for crime/safety/surveillance.  

- It's good because it will eliminate most petty crime (criminals will not get away and so most will stop attempting crime ) + drones will replace most police/soldiers (and the machines will be more ethical than humans in those positions) 

- bad because government/rich people will be able to commit more ""crime"" through increased surveillance capabilities.

Also, tourism is dramatically increase

- Because electric batteries will replace fossil fuels as the main fuel source (self-recharging vehicles etc.) and the chore of driving is removed, people will opt to travel much more. You can ""order"" a trip through somewhere and a computer planned (safe) journey will take you through, complete with augmented reality speaking computer tour guide. Many educational activities for k-12 will also be conducted this way (this will have an effect on the teaching profession).

A large number of people will be affected and will need to retrain for more educated jobs, but this will be a good thing because society and everyone in it (including the unemployed) will get much richer.",1349571474,c6ip27n,t3_1128vw,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011
129,marshallp,"Well, I wasn't intending to be amusing, we're living in exponential times, things can happen much quicker than you think. 
I said throughout that people would choose one or the other. Some people will opt to own less things and have a greater choice in renting things.

Yes, there's the ""at first it'll be on freeways"" but that relates to the following - and more relevant - point that it will exapnd beyond that to encompass everywhere.  MY point is that, regardless of what the main mode of transportation becomes, self-driving will - at least in the foreseeable future - remain very much an active sub-niche of transportation... even if only for entertainment.... like horses.

I think that people will still take control over the vehicle from time to time, not because they don´t trust the computer, but because they believe they are better than the computer.


almost every day I see people having road-rage and complaining that all the other drivers suck at driving. However just because in the beginning people might think they are better drivers, I don't think this will hamper the self-driving car wave. You wouldn't be forced to pick up your kids from school, e.t.c. 


I see two hinders from self-driving cars becoming a reality and that is:

* Car companies

If you subscribe to a service you, wouldn't buy a car, this will lead to lost revenue, I will compare this to music industry. In the beginning they tried to outlaw mp3's, today mp3's are the biggest source of income.


* The media

So far the media have been quite positive to self-driving cars. However if an accident would occur involving a sd car,(doesn't need be the cars fault,) the media have opportunity to spin it and blow it out of portion. This could leave to make people less trusting on the car.


Even if both of these come true I still think sooner or later we will have driver-less cars.



In urban areas I think more people would use fleets systems. The people which would own their car would either live far away so waiting for a car would be impractical and rich people.",1349618151,c6ivknl,t3_1128vw,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011

The price to own/operate will also be much less for self driving cars so there will really be no publicly acceptable reason to allow human drivers...eventually",1349618583,c6ivmsl,t1_c6iny1f,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011

136,visarga,"&gt; Few people are working on strong AI anymore

Instead, the focus is on applications such as - speech, OCR, object recognition, natural language processing and extracting information from bodies of text, expert systems such as Siri and Watson. When these improve, we will have a better starting point for a general artificial intelligence.

In the meantime we apply machine learning to anything:

- banks use it to give credit scores to applicants
- credit card companies fight fraud with A.I.
- financial funds use A.I. to direct high frequency micro investments (quant funds)
- doctors have diagnosis systems using graphical models (still statistics/A.I.)
- companies such as Khan's Academy try to improve the learning rate using A.I.
- Walmart and other companies operating large deposits of many items use A.I. to predict the future needs and prepare ahead
- Amazon, Netflix and other ecommerce websites try to anticipate your needs before you know it
- Pandora and other streaming services learn your tastes and supply a stream of music targeted for you
- Wikipedia is being analyzed to automatically extract an ontology (e.g. Obama is the president of the USA. USA is a country. etc)
- Police use artificial intelligence to pre-monitor hundreds of thousands of surveillance cameras and select a few to show to human operators
- Google uses A.I. to predict which website will be preferred by its clients ( see Panda update for details )
- Google Maps uses A.I. to automatically detect faces and license plates (to blur out), traffic signs (to annotate the route calculator), etc
- the Google Self Driving Car is filled with A.I.
- even the banal digital camera has face recognition
- the XBOX Kinect sensor is an A.I. wonder; it revolutionizes the human-2-computer interface

So, even if it is not as amazing as finding the singularity, we see an upsurge of machine learning and statistical processing of large volumes of data in all fields. Machine learning is probably the most promising career path now.

When you ask for one it will probably be in front of you within 10 seconds or so, which is entirely reasonable.

Furthermore, in many places cars are parked in streets next to sidewalks. If the number of cars is reduced, that space can be freed up and become extra lanes. That reduction would not be at the expense of efficiency either, because most cars today remain parked most of the time. Demand could easily be met with a fleet ten times smaller.

In rural areas, 10-second service wouldn't be cost effective, so there would be a greater advantage to owning your own car. So I think most cars outside of urban areas will still be owned by particulars. Within urban areas, however, I doubt it.

I think the answer to that question is too dependent on all the other technologies which come online before, during, and after adoption.

As to your second question, I'm actually in a carpool and we've been talking about this exact thing lately. First, it depends on what phase of adoption you are in. Early autonomous cars will require that you give much attention to the road even though you aren't driving. We are already in this phase as evidenced by adaptive cruise control, automated parking, and automatic safety braking. But I think you're asking what happens inside vehicles once they become 100% autonomous with no need for human intervention. It just depends on the form factor at that point. How will the inside of autonomous vehicles be designed? For professionals, there could be a few desks for getting work done during the commute. For children (who no longer need mom to drop them off) the inside could be an entertainment/teaching module with teaching games and movies.

I don't think that is true, at least if you define ""public transportation"" as multiple people in one vehicle.  Its clear to me that most people (Americans in particular) won't take mass transit unless they have a good reason.  Having your own car is much more popular.  Self-driving cars doesn't change that.

What I do hope will happen is this: rather than each of us owning and finding parking for our own individual cars, most of us will sign up for self-driving taxi services.  You can call a taxi from your cell phone, it drives to where you are in a minute or two (with dispatch stations liberally placed), and then it takes you where you need to go, dropping you off at the front door and returning to the dispatch station.  Robots will regularly clean and maintain the cars, so it will not feel ""used"".  This will be much cheaper and more convenient than owning a car, and should cut down on the need for huge parking lots and endless pavement.

""Historically there have been two sources of grain demand growth. The oldest of these is population growth. Each year the world adds nearly 80 million people. Tonight there will be 219,000 people at the dinner table who were not there last night, many of them with empty plates. Tomorrow night there will be another 219,000 people. Relentless population growth is putting excessive pressure on local land and water resources in many countries, making it difficult if not impossible for farmers to keep pace. ""

That is why it is so important to lower the birth rate. The best known way to do this is to move a country towards an industrial, developed economy. That is why the Gates foundation, which you dislike so much, is focused on spreading education and lowering birthrates around the world.

""The second source of growing demand for grain is consumers moving up the food chain. As incomes rose in industrial countries after World War II, people began to consume more grain-intensive livestock and poultry products: meat, milk, and eggs. Today, with incomes rising fast in emerging economies, there are at least 3 billion people moving up the food chain in the same way. The largest single concentration of these new meat eaters is in China, which now consumes twice as much meat as the United States does""

Moving up the food chain means that people in these countries eat more environmentally consuming products, like beef. That is why synthetic meat, which will be a clean, efficient, cruelty free solution to this is so important. People will be able to continue eating the way that they choose, but without the environmental effects.

""Now there is a third source of demand for grain: the automobile. Distillers use grain to produce fuel ethanol for cars, an activity that is concentrated in the United States and that has developed largely since 2005. In 2011, the United States harvested nearly 400 million tons of grain. Of this, 127 million tons (32 percent) went to ethanol distilleries. ""

We've talked a lot about the future of autonomous cars. Google already has a working self driving car that hasn't had an accident in over 300,000 miles. A conservative guess for when they will be deployed is 10 years for the first commercially available car and 20 for almost total adoption. Not only will these cars be orders of magnitude more efficient in moving people around, they are almost certain to run on electricity, giving you back those 127 million tons of grain.

Not to mention vertical farms. Earlier this year, Singapore opened its first vertical farm. http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;ved=0CD8QFjAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fdesign%2F2012%2F10%2Fvertical-farm-in-singapore%2F&amp;ei=b2_GUO39IIzs8gS48IHoCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEyAqIW1yM-IuYdWn0dk-pBtiPhKQ

Vertical farms will be essential in getting us through the food crisis. They can be local, almost completely autonomous and carbon neutral. If vertical farms become standard ""a significant portion of farmland could be abandoned,"" he says. ""Ecosystem functions would rapidly improve, and the rate of global warming would slow down.""

 - 15 years, all new cars will be electric. (Most self-driving and corporation operated like taxis)
 - 20 years, all new trucks, appliances, furnaces, etc.. will be electric.
 - 30 years, all non-renewable installations shut down globally.

As far as the environment, it'll probably keep getting worse for a long time.

 - 15 years - All major governments will accept it and start trying to drastically prevent the problem in all fields (mining, manufacturing, etc..).
 - 30 years - We will start changing the climate with more direct measures (geoengineering, filtering our air, CO2-&gt;O2 machines, etc..).

201,wadcann,"&gt;There's no definitive way to write a book, make a song, etc nor is it even possible to literally make a perfect piece that every single human ever will enjoy,

There isn't an absolute metric for ""every person will like this"", and I cannot write a list of steps on an 8.5x11"" piece of paper to write a book.

However, neither of these concerns should be fundamental constraints on AI.  The first point is that we do not currently understand all the factors going into the best way to write a book.  That's true, but much of that is the *point* of AI.  If we could just write down a list of two hundred precisely-defined steps that will lead to a book, we wouldn't need an AI; we could just use conventional programming to produce a book-writing computer.

The point of an AI is that it can learn.  I can write a framework of the AI, and that framework can then take in data from the outside world itself and become more-capable in dealing with the outside world without me needing to subsequently involve myself.  With an AI, the idea is that it infers those however-many-steps there are.

We already do that with our limited, non-general-purpose artificial intelligences.  I haven't been following Google's self-driving car efforts, but in some past projects, like Carnegie-Mellon's self-driving car that went coast-to-coast, the car was driven by a neural network trained off a bunch of video footage.  No human knows the rules that the neural network inferred from the video footage or has ever written them down; in fact, given that this is a neural network, it's not really encoded in a way that is very helpful to a human being in understanding.  However, the rules *are* there, inferred from the video footage.

Second, the fact that not every single human being will enjoy the same book shouldn't be a problem.  It just means that for the function ""WriteBook"", the particular human in question is an input, something that changes the output of WriteBook.  Google Maps does this today.  No single human being will want the same set of directions from Google Maps, so we plug in a little bit of information about the person (like the desired starting and ending points of their trip) and Google Maps spits out a list of directions to get from point A to point B.

&gt; AI will be a lot smarter and all that but I'd imagine a lot less creative than humans in general simply because humans are used to thinking outside of the box,

Our current computer programs are not practical artificial general intelligences; they cannot deal with problems as generally as a human can.  However, that's not something that I'd expect to be a fundamental limitation.

&gt; while it's practically certain the first AIs will be based off 1s and 0s.

&lt;shrug&gt; Nothing about using ""1""s and ""0""s should constrain the AI.  If I made a computer that simulated every atom in your body, you'd be encoded with ""1""s and ""0""s.

&gt;while AI will begin with maths, I can see it ending up that we have mostly AI doing maths, science, etc style tasks while humans tend to stick to more creative style tasks, at least for the first few generations of AI.

It's easier for us to create computer that process math, but we've also already got pretty-powerful systems for solving mathematical problems; a lot of these can be solved without artificial general intelligence.",1355206913,c7ep2of,t1_c7eo4jv,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011

While other companies do have access to large libraries of maps, Google has the advantage that their maps have been built on for at least the last couple of years with this in mind, it is no coincidence that they sent their own cars with both sensors AND mapping equipment (not to mention imaging equipment to provide panoramic images which can be mapped with a little Google ingenuity to a vector based map of every street.)

This is really all part of one master plan, Google hope to control every piece of information required to make self driving cars both safe and easy for the manufacturers.

I do however doubt they will make their own car, short of acquiring a company which is failing, it would be too big of a leap for them to make, the jump from say, computers to mobiles is quite a small one, however, the jump from mobiles to automobiles is a humongous one, dealing more with mechanics than electronics, so the most likely answer is that: no, they won't be making their own car.",1356828864,c7o0or7,t3_15nbke,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2011

We are talking about hundreds of map makers here, all trying to improve every single corner and road to make the most efficient and most importantly, accurate map possible, they make it a real art.

One thing no one notices is that this technology has existed within Google maps for quite a while, type in one address, ask it to take you to another and it will give you a route, a route to anywhere (within reason) but a route which has informative and concise directions, showing that the computer understands the most efficient route to take, but also the distance and the length of time and a graphical route, which unless it's faked (which I very much doubt) shows that their system also understands the visual nature of the route, which for human thinking at least, is normally the most important.

When you plug these two simple function returns in to the bigger picture (IE, a self driving car with collision detecting, advanced movement sensors etc) you come up with an actual product: A car which, without human interaction save a finish point (GPS can pretty much cover the start point) can take you all the way there.

28,wadcann,"&gt;in many ways relive our past in high resolution.

I would guess not (or at least not via the sort of approach that you are describing).  If your brain can't fully recall the color or surroundings or the smells or whatnot, it's likely that that data isn't up in the noggin any more.  Your brain is impressive because it selects the important bits and filters out the rest.  This operation is a great deal of what goes into intelligence.  But instead, your brain uses heuristics to remember what to remember.  Was that experience stressful, or did it have emotional attachments?  Probably worth hanging onto.  Was there something in the background behind what you were looking at?  Probably not worth storing.  Can't quite remember something?  Fill in what was *probably* there from similar memories (hence [problems with eyewitness testimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyewitness_testimony)).

So it's not that the brain can't kick itself into that ""experience mode"", but that it probably didn't store the necessary information to perfectly recreate that event.

&gt;I suppose ultimately this would be possible if we download our mind into a machine, then we could selectively control, remove, add or relive memories.

Not necessarily.  You're used to data on a computer being easy to manipulate.  If there's a file, you delete it.  It's nice and discrete and can be manipulated.

But the brain doesn't work like that.  There's no one location in your head that stores that time when you kissed Sally Smith.  It's stored all over, spread out, and tied up with other things.  It's not easy to rip out just one thing.

One type of artificial intelligence work has been done using [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_networks), which models the way our heads work to some degree.  Carnegie-Mellon's self-driving car, and later Google's self-driving cars, use this approach.  Neural networks have some nice pluses.  They learn in a nice, generic way; given enough processing power and enough learning time, they can do anything.  However, they are not very amenable to later analysis and changes of the sort you want.  You don't get a list of simple, clean rules that can be easily added and removed.  You get lots of memories all tied up together.  That means that removing memories may not be so easy.

If you want me to put this less-abstractly, it's that kiss you gave Sally that is stored with and interacts with memories of later kisses, of people named Sally, of people in general, of love...even if you could find everything that remembering that first kiss makes you think of and zeroed it, you'd be affecting all those other memories in peculiar, unpredictable ways.  And furthermore, zeroing that out may be hard.  Maybe you wrote someone a letter describing your first kiss.  That letter isn't something that thinking of that kiss makes you think of.  But even if your memory of the actual kiss was wiped out, you can still remember writing that letter about it.  I'd suspect that we've some ability to reconstruct memories from that sort of thing.",1358133051,c7whh34,t3_16iv4s,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2013

32,str3amline,"This is an interesting question you ask, and one that I have speculated on in the past. My two cents are this: automation is economically favorable. As robotics and AI mature, smart robots will eliminate the need for humans to do simple jobs (drive taxis, manage physical inventory, flip burgers, etc). It's in the best interest of big businesses to automate. Sure, it will be a large investment, but big businesses have the means of making that investment, and from there on onwards, labor becomes as cheap as paying for electricity &amp; maintenance, labor cannot unionize, and labor can work 24/7. Already, google has created self-driving cars. They work. And google is pursuing legislation in certain states to legalize them. This technology will soon become commonplace in the US and the rest of the world (and why not, this is definitely a step forward). But on the flipside, people who make a living that depends solely on driving cars (truck drivers &amp; cabbies) lose jobs. Why would a trucking company want to pay Jimmy a yearly salary when they can make a one-time investment on a self-driving truck that will make them money for a lifetime? The wealth gap that currently exists in America will continue widening. Those with wealth (e.g. those currently controlling business) are the ones who will be able to afford automative technologies, which by their embracing will allow them to acquire even more wealth. At the same time, those that are not at the top of businesses and are workers whose jobs can be automated will slowly find that there simply aren't any jobs available for them. Sure, more jobs will open up in the future in the fields of science and engineering, but the amount of positions that will become available in these fields will amount no where near the number of jobs that will be lost because of these fields.

54,EndTimer,"As an additional bit of information, autopilots are quite capable of landing and take-off.  Human pilots handle these things as a matter of liability.  Aircraft are orders of magnitude more expensive than cars and navigation and autonomous systems have been seldom updated.  Even when they are, in many planes, the systems are not economical to replace.  Further, the requirements to be a commercial airliner pilot are:

&gt; The minimum pilot experience is 1,500 hours of flight time, 500 hours of cross-country flight time, 100 hours of night flight time, and 75 hours instrument operations time (simulated or actual). Other requirements include being 23 years of age, an instrument rating, being able to read, write, speak, and understand the English language, a rigorous written examination, and being of good moral character.[17]

which utterly, totally dwarfs your typical driver.  And these are requirements, not indicative of your typical transport pilot that has tens-of-thousands of hours flight time.

Truthfully, there isn't much incentive at this time to develop more automated planes.  Airliner pilots aren't particularly well-paid, and are tremendously good liability shields.  Pilots are responsible for checking the entirety of the aircraft and all instruments on their aircraft.  They have massive checklists to go through for takeoff.  And this remains the same for aircraft that are one year old or 20, there are still 747's originally manufactured in the 1970's still in the air.  The avionics are surely upgraded, but how often?  Finally, it's a seller's market when it comes to airlines.  There's not really a substitute, people cannot fly themselves, so they take what you're offering or don't fly.  Any of the individual vehicle owners on a plane might enjoy a self-driving car and still be quite content to fly on a human-flown aircraft due to the excellent safety record aviation has had over the years.

In 2010, Audi sent a driverless Audi TTS to the top of Pike’s Peak at close to race speeds.[4]

In 2011, Volvo began to develop an almost-autonomous 'road train' system for highways which could be integrated in cars by 2020.[39]

In 2011, Alan Taub, GM’s vice president of global research and development, stated that the company planned to release semi-autonomous cars by 2015, and fully autonomous cars by 2020.[40]

Volkswagen is currently testing a ""Temporary Auto Pilot"" (TAP) system that will allow a car to drive itself at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour on the highway.[41]

Ford is researching driverless systems and vehicular communication systems.[42] Bill Ford predicts semi-autonomous driving with greater interaction between cars between 2017 and 2025 and fully autonomous vehicles beyond 2025.[43]

In 2011, Mercedes-Benz announced its 2013 S-Class will feature an autonomous driving system. At speeds of up to 25 mph, the S-Class will drive itself through slow-moving traffic jams using a series of cameras and radar-based monitoring systems controlling the speed and distance to the vehicle in front.[44]

In 2012, Audi announced plans to introduce a new autonomous driving system at speeds of up to 37 mph dubbed 'Traffic Jam Assistant'. The system will likely debut sometime before 2014 on the Audi A8.[45]

In 2012, Cadillac revealed their semi-autonomous system called ""Super Cruise"". The system could be ready for production vehicles by mid-decade.[46]

In October 2012, Nissan unveiled its NSC-2015 autonomous electric prototype.[5]

In January 2013, Toyota demonstrated a partially self-driving car with numerous sensors and communication systems.[6]

Other programs in the field include the 2GetThere passenger vehicles from the Netherlands and the entrants of the DARPA Grand Challenge in the USA.

59,joeyoungblood,"Thanks for the kind words. I had thought of ride share, but if you look at the numbers they really are not putting a dent in auto ownership right now. The fact is that owning something material is an intrinsic need. The reason file sharing is a big deal is because media files do not fill a physiological need for human survival. Means of transportation is an extension of basic locomotion so many people will find it difficult to extract themselves from that need and allow themselves to share a vehicle. When media files went digital the hope was that holding a newspaper or magazine would carry some value still or that owning dvd's and cd's would become a status symbol, it has not and remains a symbol of either a collector or someone without the means to obtain or store digital files.

Automotives though have always been a status symbol as were horses / elephants / mules / oxen before them. It is doubtful that cars equipped with self-driving technology would disappear completely from the realms of ownership. However, you are correct that it would make ride-share much easier, especially in cramped urban centers where auto ownershipt is not as prevalent even today. My guess would be that rideshare would be a much bigger threat to taxi's in places like Manhattan allowing for maximum efficiency they might also displace city owned/subsidized public bus transportation.

Roads, for example - if teleportation became a reality we would no longer need them, and most of that land would simply return to nature.  To a lesser degree this may happen with self-driving cars becoming a reality.

74,NoblePotatoe,"I'll take a shot at why this is being developed and adopted so much faster then electric vehicles: because it isn't as hard.

The difficulty with electric cars is the battery. Gasoline is fantastically energy dense. Really, it is mind bogling when you try to think up alternatives and then attempt to compare them (really, try it: batteries, compressed air, fly wheels, fuel cells come close but you are essentially burning hydrogen and oxygen in highly controled conditions).  So, the obvious answer is to pay for more battery research.

Battery research is... well, it is research. There really is no time table, progress happens when it happens and there is no gaurantee that it will happen at all. As a result, most funding for the research has to come from governmental sources who are much more comfortable with the risk/reward ratio.

Self driving cars are really not that difficult. Each of the individual problems: recognizing where you are, recognizing other cars/obsticals, finding routes, observing traffic signs, and actually controlling the car have all been mostly solved in other applications. 

The difficult part, I'm sure, has simply been packaging it all into a single reliable solution. Since each of the steps have already been completed by someone else, there is far less risk in paying a handfull of programmers to re-appropreat those solutions for a self-driving car. There for the risk/reward ratio is tipped much more in the favor of investment by private industry.

77,shiningmidnight,"I just simply don't agree.

People, at least not all people, from this world who were transported to a magical world wouldn't lose interest in magic just because they had to study it. I have no interest in performing scientific research myself. I **do** however, have an interest in the *results* of scientific research that have brought us things like self-driving cars, portable ekgs, robotic exoskeletons that enhance a normal human's abilities. In much the same way, I am vastly interested in tapping into a cosmic force that makes my will into reality with a few words and gestures. It's not that I would want to research new spells, or the reasons behind magic working. I don't need to know exactly how a capacitive touchscreen works to use or enjoy my tablet. 

Also, any fantasy fans familiar with the popular mechanics of magic wouldn't have a problem memorizing an incantation to be able to perform incredible acts that should be impossible for a human to perform. Because that's how it's ~always~ almost always portrayed in the books. If it isn't as a result of study it's the result of an in-born unique talent, which would also not garner a ""ho hum"" attitude as there would only be one person who could do it.

And they *certainly* wouldn't lose their interest just by being sent to a world where magic is prevalent. If they are of our world, magic would still be amazing to *them* even if it was matter-of-fact to the regulars.

And if we're talking about citizens born into a world where magic exists, it depends entirely upon the magical system whether or not it would be considered amazing or a laissez-faire aspect of everyday life. I have read books where, yes, the citizens who inhabit the world take magic for granted the same way we do electricity. But in many, many more of the fantasy novels where magic is a well-known and expected part of everyday life the wizards and mages are treated with reverence and wonder. In a huge selection of these novels, magic can only be used by the select few, born with the talent or aptitude. That built-in eliteness of a ""members-only"" club that can do things far beyond the normal human is like the difference between someone being able to down some cough syrup or lozenges, and being a surgeon.",1360097430,c89xcx1,t3_17xpav,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2013

Alarm clock rings. The wall sized OLED screen fools me into thinking I'm waking up in a cabin by the sea. It's a live stream from the other side of the world. The other side of my room gives my real location away. The 5th floor of a community building. I touch the wallsized window and - according to my preferances - it shows the weather forcast and availability of self driving cars in my area, as well as new messages. 

It's 8:00. A shower whips me into shape. Time to get ready for Yoga class in the community center down the street, where all kinds of things are already going on. Tai Chi, Aikido, Weightlifting, Art Classes.

Yoga rocks. I'm still incredibly spry for my 60 years. I look younger too.

The machine at the self service station has a variety of healthy and not so healthy food. I sit down at a table and read the newspapers/blogs t on my tablet over lunch. The oldest human to ever live, lives in Italy and is 135 years old today. He's trumping this announcement by saying that he's seen enough. He'll take his final nap at a local hospice center later this week at his own request.

Well, it's 9:00 o'clock. I need to get going. I'm meeting up with friends to go hiking, enjoy nature and catching up with them. I call a car through my portable. Almost immediately I see a dot moving on the map, heading to my location. The countdown says 2:27 until arrival. This time will not change. I can also see when I will arrive at my final destination. I forward this information to my friends.

A nice little path through the woods leads us on top of a hill where we have a little snack and a beer. After we're done we hook up to the cable that  enables us to basically glide back down like birds.

We take a car, then hit the pub to play cards, eat lunch and play retro videogames. (GTA V multiplayer. Good times).

Art class starts at 16:00 and that piece of clay starts to resemble something after all. Not bad. Two hours later I'm going weightlifting. Need to keep in shape. Maybe I can beat that Italian guy.

113,ZedsBread,"Our system right now is crumbling. It is quickly becoming obsolete. The internet is already destroying quite a few industries and standards, such as scarcity of media, the idea that you need established corporations to reach a potentially global audience (self-published artists and people who obtain funding through kickstarter and such)... Once 3D printers become commercial, that's it for manufacturing, built-in obsolescence (we can self-manufacture individual parts instead of having to buy a whole new product every x years), and material scarcity (other than the printing materials, I suppose). And once automation gets to a certain point, virtually all labor is gone; food assembly, construction, any car-related jobs (self-driving cars)... once the majority of jobs and industries that are around today are rendered obsolete, there will be a huge unemployment rate, and without a subsequent raise in our standards of education, there will undoubtedly be revolution as people become more frustrated with how our system has failed to take into account technological change and abundance as opposed to forced scarcity, which IS what our system is based on.

I'm optimistic that we won't blow ourselves up. It's entirely possible, but I really don't think that we, the people will allow it to happen. Politicians can try and maintain the status quo all they want, but as we know, technological progress/change happens exponentially faster than social and economic change. Some people say that's awful, but I think it's irrelevant and that eventually, once our technology gets to the level I describe above, we will have absolutely no choice but to dramatically uproot our living systems. It sucks right now because we're in the transition stage, and that's a hard stage to be in, but we'll get out eventually.

I'm hoping for something along the lines of Jacque Fresco's resource-based economy; we declare the Earth as a common heritage for every living person and thing both present and future, make it something for everyone to actually care about. We take inventory of all our natural resources. We teach people to be problem solvers instead of soldiers, and generalists instead of specialists first. We appoint scientists to make decisions based on data, reasoning, and efficiency, not politicians who are basically schooled in sociopathy. We do away with concepts of land property and material ownership, since the Earth belongs to everyone. Abundance is possible if we take automation to a high level to maximize production and cut down our birthrate - even a little bit. Eventually - not at first, and probably not all at once - we do away with the monetary system, since a monetary system requires scarcity, and if we have abundance, it becomes unnecessary. Why bother with 'IOUs' if both of our needs are met practically?  

Every parasite wants to be a symbiote. We've been acting as a parasite for the past couple thousand years, but now we're becoming aware both cosmically and of the self, and learning that we're a part of a grand system and were made for it, not the other way around as certain organized religions imply. I imagine a world where we basically act as neurons composing a superorganism called 'humanity', forming a neural network of people. We've already started down that road with the internet.

Also, Congress has been kicking around some 'kids and cars' legislation from NHTSA for a while, which would essential mandate backup cameras.  If that hits, it will also help to push down costs on camera systems as a whole, which are a major component of some car automation schemes.

I don't think it will happen that soon, but I do expect an eventual switch from rasterization.  I should point out that path-tracing is only one way of making this happen.  One of the coolest things I've seen is where games are rendered on a server farm, compressed as streaming video, sent over the Internet, and decompressed on whatever device you like, all in a few milliseconds.  This is already existing technology used by companies like OnLive, Gaikai, Otoy, and others.  It makes it possible to play Crisis on your phone.

I'll have to disagree strongly on this one.  It isn't the self driving thing I disagree with, it's the EV part.  The reason we don't have EVs isn't because of some oil lobby cabal, it is because batteries are still **way** to expensive.  The problem is that their rate of improvement is mocked by turtles and snails alike.  Would you believe the cheapest battery per watt-hour stored is *still* the lead-acid battery that is well over 100 years old?  Of course that make no sense for cars since it is so heavy.  I really wish all the announcements about this technology or that technology that will soon make batteries both light and cheap were more than vaporware, I really do, but I have yet to see evidence to the contrary.

What's the difference between Glass and the normal human eye/brain operation, other than the fact that Glass does the same thing better? You will still remember that dog doing the funny thing on the street outside that bistro, but glass will back up that memory with visual/audio proof. Should we ban human memory too? 

I get the point that you can't just share a photo on facebook from your memory, but glass can. All we're changing is the medium of the story telling though. In ancient Greece it would have been Bob telling Jim ""Man, you should have seen this dog at the bistro, he did the funniest thing!"", he may even try to act it out.

It will raise awareness of what's actually happening around us all, and I find that *knowing* I'm being watched is much more polite than a drone or an NSA employee spelunking through my Skype conversations.

I don't think there is any evidence that points to this. Instead what would probably happen is, instead of Comcast having 200 very rich executives, those 200 very rich executives would all be the 200 very rich small business owners. The numbers really wouldn't change that much, there would be just as many cashiers - it's not like small businesses don't need as many of them.

&gt; You can't make the argument that things would cost more because it would be a whole different type of economy. Things might cost less. Who knows!

That's not true. We can look at how efficient economies were before the industrial revolution, where there were no big corporations. Just about every economist would agree that multinational corporations lead to cheaper products, and you've given no substantial evidence to the contrary besides saying ""who knows"".

&gt; Also, if communities had lots of small businesses, I think there would be more social cohesion, more vibrancy. A big box discount retailer does very little for the community except provide mostly low-wage service jobs with very little opportunity for advancement.

If most people thought social cohesion was that important, they would all choose to pay more and shop local. This is not a corporation problem - your priorities are simply different from most people who would rather just pay less.

&gt; look at Comcast, for example. A shitty corporation, but in some geographical areas there is no choice. If Comcast was limited to 10% of the market, other ISPs could set up shop and some small business could make a decent living selling cable internet.

The problem is, it is prohibitively expensive to setup an internet service - there is little competition when there are high barriers to entry. What's the point of laying down all of the infrastructure if you can't sell to anyone? Also, there are two major reasons why someone could only buy from Comcast. The first one is, it is a very rural area and no other company wants to build the infrastructure. And in rural areas if you required there to be two services, both of them probably wouldn't be able to make enough money to survive.

The other is that it is a government sponsored monopoly. For instance in Baltimore City the government setup a deal to only allow Comcast to provide internet... a big reason why I don't like government involvement in business.

Recently the government considered punishing Google under anti-trust violations but chose not to.

The real downside of self driving cars is the massive job loss for taxi and lorry drivers - as s/d cars won't need regular rest breaks, the efficiency savings will drive freight fleet replacement before s/d taxi services arrive. Socially, they will deliver potentially much cheaper personal transport and somewhat cheaper goods as delivery networks become that much cheaper and more efficient; as well as likely massively reducing accident rates (95% due to human error, mostly due to looked-but-didn't-see change blindness and objects in the blind spot). 

Mass transit will still be the fast way to get around due to not being blocked by other traffic, but there'll be very little reason to own a car in a major city once electric s/d cars in a range of sizes become widely hireable: especially if someone implements induction coils in road surfaces to give EV infinite range.

There is a very very interesting podcast from radiolab on this. Basically the idea is, once cars are able to drive themselves, there is no need for everyone to have one. You could just buy into a service that gives you an X amount of hours of use from their entire car pool, without having to pay for gas, insurance or maintenance of the car.  Imagine having an app on your phone, where you can enter your schedule for the day, and a car that you use your own PIN number to use is always waiting for you outside your home/work/whatever, ready to go when you are. The savings for people, and society at large would be huge. No need to have gigantic parking lots where cars sit unused for hours on end, no cold starts causing significantly more pollution, the advantages of it would be tangible and clear.  Of course, the problem would be to convince people to actually trust automatic cars, but I think that that is going to happen anyways, once people realize how much safer they are than human drivers.  Anyways, I don't think that the car as such is going away, more that our current model of everyone having their own personal transportation device is. Until we invent hoverboards anyways.

With taxi fleet of automated cars, it would be more economical to use alternative fuel sources, since the cost of the car is distributed over more people and it will pay back sooner.

Well, true ... I mean in my perfect-world scenario cars would self-drive along commuter routes, and then be manual-optional on other routes (basically bridging the gap between individual vehicles and mass transit - already underway in sharing economics). And I imagine this *will* be an interstitial stage before ultimately we're forbidden from controlling our own vehicles at all (maybe even no more steering wheels).

It's the visceral aspect that's hard to describe, and it's not just about the driving - it's about being able to go where I want without being tracked, monitored, and yet to feel in control, etc... the freedom to get away. In college, I used to go for aimless drives just to clear my head, and felt better knowing that no one could reach me (at that point, cell phones were around but not ubiquitous).

168,[deleted],"I am totally with you on the numbers.  But it's not only the transistor density that's going to change.  The way we approach large computation in general has to change.

Moving along in parallel with this is research into how the brain works.  Your time-frame for a form of AI might be right, but consider that between current computers and that AI, we have some serious mind-melding computational abilities to discover, and implementations that we've never dreamed of.  For the next decade, this isn't a bad prediction at all.

Just look at the kinds of research that's going on to push us to the next level of processing.  I mean, like asynchronous computing, FPGA software-hardware meld.  All of this is taking modern lithography capabilities and taking them into a more amorphous, almost organic-like turn.

A ""real AI"" would supposedly be the *true* turning point for the singularity - that being an artificial intelligence as good as a human.

* Smart technology truly ""Smart"" (start of A.I) and not just intuitively controlled.

* Internet ...INTERNET EVERYWHERE (Start car with smart phone is mainstream, change channel with ""phone"" is mainstream, open door to fridge set temperature of house...thing we can technically do now, but the average house hold consumer can't even imagine)

* Perhaps ""self driving"" could be a thing, but I still don't think it's probable. 

* Discovery's (possibility of) life outside this planet, new fundamental physics like dark energy etc. Maybe Einstein's theories are expanded on to a new fundamental level. 

* Cloning animals 

* The rise of the totalitarian police state. Police forces will be largely federal and datamining will track anyone who could be a ""terrorist"" in the future (have to keep the sheep in their stable!)

* Start of the mission to mars (research starts for real)

* Recovery of the American and EU economy. 

* Lights 2.0 (everything is LED)

* Batteries 2.0 (Long lasting fast charging, graphine stuff)

* No more pennies! Pay by ""phone""  (Japan is doing this)

* Magnetic trains unlikely going mainstream  (more like 2040)

Think of the impact on the car industry itself. Why would you own a self-drive car, besides having a car to drive yourself for fun? You could rent one and it would just arrive at your front door to pick you up. In urban areas you would have large fleet owners leveraging economies of scale to acquire and maintain their fleets. Auto dealers will become far fewer, whether new or second-hand.

You could of course point out that software has bugs, but knowing google there is enough redundancy in the system to prevent that from happening. If vital systems start bugging out it would probably just park into safe area and call maintenance.

Edit: since a lot of people have commented about processing speed and reaction time I've dug up more info.

&gt;On the basis of these experiments, however, driver response times can be expected to 
exceed the commonly accepted design value of 2.5 s relatively frequently. Excluding car 
following, seven of eleven response eliciting situations produced 85th percentile values 
above 2.5 s, and four of these had values of 3.0 s or more.

accuracy, using a standard Linux kernel.

The aforementioned is just the time it takes for data to travel from sensor to the software stack. Unfortunately I couldn't find any information on how long it takes for the car systems to process said data. My estimation would be in the less than second area, which means humans have already been surpassed.

264,[deleted],"&gt;I know it isn't the current situation

We are in Futurology after all ;)

Yes and no. Short and sweet version: Each individual car would still need to have enough processing power for the cases when other cars aren't around and when looking for people running into the road. The extracted data can certainly be shared to other cars when they are close by to reduce the needed processing power, this is especially true when they are relatively clustered together where for example of a pair of cars could agree to only look in front/back.

If the cars are able to share information about the objects/obstacles that they have recognised they could also just share the information about their own position, speed and even their intentions. Sharing raw sensory information isn't really viable due to the large volumes of data (Which we're all assuming is actually large, I have no idea how big the data is) and the slow speed of wireless communication. Direct [Line of Sight networking](http://tech.slashdot.org/story/13/04/06/1320245/german-scientists-visible-light-network-hits-3gbps) is actually relatively fast though, so that's one avenue that could be pursued.

But with cars sharing only a minimal set of information leads to awesome possibilities:

[pic](http://i.imgur.com/iHdXGCU.png)  
In the top part of my awesome graphic traditional cars have to stop and wait for the lights before going, but when the majority/all of the cars on the road are self ~~aware~~ driving they could sort of interlace between each other as shown in the bottom part (The future is greener right?). The fuel savings of this no-stopping technique is also noteworthy. They could get away with much lower processing power requirements when it comes to being aware of other self driving cars on the road, but they'd still need to spend large amount of power looking out for pedestrians or other obstacles which they can't really share effectively to other cars. Which makes me wonder if the current google car has good enough resolution to keep an eye out for small animals on the road. With increases in resolution the processing power needed just keeps going up.

266,darlingpinky,"Well, I'd argue that a plane that knows how to navigate through the same air where it has to make sure it doesn't collide with other planes has much of the same sort of decision-making algorithms as a self-driving car. Yes, a car has many more obstacles, but that doesn't mean that the plane is not making decisions. AFAIK, the people controlling drones don't actually control the yaw and pitch and the individual ailerons of the plane. They just tell it to go somewhere on the map and the plane figures out how to get there. That is, as far as I can tell, a form of intelligence, and should therefore make drones eligibile to be applicable to Asimov's laws.",1368209144,c9w9wqn,t1_c9w9nvi,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2013

268,Xelif,"&gt; Then there is the problem of malicious attacks against the car systems, but I'll let architecture designers worry about that.

The big problem here is that very few, if any, systems are completely safe against determined attackers. This is particularly true for systems that network with other systems that the attacker has complete control over - witness how pretty much everything connected to the Internet is vulnerable to something or other, whether it's viruses, or direct hacking, or a plain dumb DDoS attack; us commoners are shielded from determined attackers purely by virtue of not being worth attacking.

If there's someone untrustworthy on your network, your network is virtually guaranteed to be insecure in some way or another. You can only mitigate the damage done by attackers. When it comes to networked self-driving cars, the car must use its on-board sensors to make the ultimate decision on any maneuvers, rather than trusting the network's input - if the car in front of you says ""SHIT BRAKE BRAKE STOP NOW!"", your car must evaluate whether emergency braking is actually necessary in this situation. As far as navigation and efficient traffic flow systems go, the car has to be able to obtain traffic data from multiple independent sources and determine whether the suggested most efficient route is in fact valid - and if it's invalid, have some way of correcting while still maintaining efficient navigation.

I'm hopeful that carmakers will avoid too many vulnerabilities when it comes to safety of transit, but once efficient networked navigation is standard, I expect to see successful ""traffic bombs"" - traffic being maliciously redirected so as to cause worse gridlock than today's standard, autonomous, plain normal human navigation would cause - about as often as we see major commercial Internet services (websites, networks, etc.) compromised or taken down now.",1368252802,c9wmxqr,t1_c9vhi3c,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2013
269,korneliuslongshanks,"Because communism can't work the ways it has been tried in the past.

First off, communism requires global cooperation. Global communism or bust. With that said, it is obviously pretty difficult to achieve that level of connectedness.

Communism cannot have a leader. Every example has some evil leader who starves his people or murders the fuck out of them? Where did Karl Marx say to do that in his manifesto?

Communism requires a singularity of minds. That means no religion too. People could still choose to believe there is a gods and you could read all the wonderful stories it provides us of the barbaric nature of our ancient ancestors still. But it cannot tolerate 40000 different groups saying they are the only right organization. That is thinking and living in the dark ages.

Communism also requires self driving cars, ubiquitous robots, and most things to be automated. Once we have those things, which are on our doorstep, communism could and would be the most efficient system.

Because what are the minimum requirements for survival: food, water, shelter, entertainment, love. You don't think with all the wealth, manpower, technology of 300+ million Americans or 7 Billion humans can't provide those things?

We already make enough food, but because of money, crops get forcibly thrown out or not used at full capacity and people go hungry because of this.

We've got millions of empty homes in america yet millions of people living on the streets. And you mean to tell me COMMUNISM DOESN'T WORK?

Tell me when any system has been anywhere near the one I've described. Of course communism will fail when you have the red scare and basically everything not in communism's favor to ensure its demise. Let's stop thinking about 60s communism and think about Star Trek type communism.

We are the Federation. We can change the world. It starts with just one. Spread the word. It can't happen with you though.

Besides those people would have to do something with their money thus economic growth and increased tax income. Some smartass would have to do some insane math to check that but IMO it's doable.

271,SamuraiRafiki,"I kind of see it like this: 

Let's say Jeff comes up with an idea for an automated fast food restaurant, and he builds it. The startup costs are higher than a McDonalds, but once it's in, he just has to pay one person to monitor the machines full time and occasionally take in and load stock. Otherwise, the customers are putting in their orders with touch screens and robots are assembling the hamburgers; what would normally take a team of 4-9 full time is now taking just one guy. Jeff's profit margins are phenomenal. Now, he could just open a chain of very successful automated restaurants, but why stop there? Jeff instead opens up a factory where machines put together his restaurant machines, and sells these to McDonalds, Burger King, Wendys, etc. Now all of these companies eliminate their cook staff and buy Jeff's machines, then they eliminate their serving staff and put in Jeff's touch screens, and everyone is making great profits. Except that now Jeff has automated everyone in the fast food industry out of a job. 

Google's self driving car becomes big and trucking companies think that it's the bee's knees and invest heavily, so that now pretty much every 18-wheeler, delivery truck, and moving van is driverless. 

RFID gets cheaper and now department stores are using it to tag their merchandise. Jeff's college girlfriend Jenny comes up with a self-checkout for department stores and now JC Penny's, Dillards and Sears eliminate their cash registers. Then she makes a robot that a guest can drop clothes in, then it can fold them and re-rack them by itself. Inventory and upkeep costs plummet. They reduce their staff to just style consultants. The innovations of Jeff and Jenny inspire more technologists to piggyback from their work and now 80% of manufacturing and half the service jobs are done by machine. Great for the companies, who have been engaged in a war to drop the bottom out of their prices while maintaining competitive profit margins, great for Jeff and Jenny who are making scads of money, but crappy for the economy, because now we have 15% unemployment. 

Now they can reduce the prices all they want, but unemployment is so high that there just aren't enough consumers. They also can't afford housing so that market is crashing. Without consumers the economy grinds to a halt.

Here's where basic income comes in. Every company pays an increased tax, offset perhaps by their payroll, which spreads the burden around. This goes as basic income to the bottom 20% or 50% or whatever who can now afford housing, food and some entertainment. The economy starts moving again. Companies have to pay into the system, but because what were their payroll costs are now spread over the whole economy it's still cheaper than operating a full staff, and their staffing and human resources costs are way down. 

Not worrying about going bankrupt and becoming homeless and starving on the streets, people are able to relax and can experiment with more small businesses, many of which might go down but some of which will succeed, providing their owners and their employees with income above the basic so they can afford luxuries. Minimum wage can go down because everyone's being paid something, at least, so let's say Josephine lost her job at Sears when she was replaced by a robot, but while she was resenting the robot she came up with an idea for a style window, where a shopper can pick a few clothing items and input them into a computer, then stand in front of a screen that will show the customer how they'd look in that outfit. Jacques opens up a retro-restaurant that has human servers and cooking staff just to tickle the hipsters. Jim opens up a hardware store, and Julie spends her free time designing clothes and opens up her own store.

This eliminates all traffic as your selfie would adjust acceleration to ensure no other selfie trains or manual drivers pass intersections when you do.

Basic self driving tech doesn't require the expensive tech Google models posses. Lane and brake assistance and adaptive cruise control do most of the work. Many high end cars have this today. If all these cars just talked to each other, they could work together.

There's no ""evil academia"" - it's simply not the only entry point any longer - as is evidenced by the continual onslaught of (internet based) discovery and collaboration (such as [this](http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/students-self-driving-car-tech-wins-intel-science-fair-1C9977186) - a few links beyond the OP on reddit)

If you can cite a source that can link you to more information than google (not google specifically mind you, but the search engine methodology) I will gladly listen. 

The broader message is this:
English is spoken in more countries than any other language because it adopts words from ANY source. It is a wiki language.
Linux is used on more computer than any other operating system. It is a wiki operating system
Science became the most profound method of discovery because it's rules were simple - anyone could contribute, and repeatability was king. 
Democracy is the ruling political philosophy because it is a wiki collaboration.
Organisms that are capable of sourcing from many different energy sources (like humans) are the most effective at survival. None of these are flawless, but they all utilise the same principles. Academia chokes out it's own core defining quality, and from that fallout we see independent innovation thanks to the broad scale collaboration afforded by the internet and its collaborative culture.

Adaptation and diversity is the name of the game. What you have with the internet is the ability for anyone to communicate with anyone else. It is, infact, a brain. The connections are neural pathways, and as with any brain, often insight comes not from existing pathways, or even through well worn pathways, but from when data is forced to flow through unusual pathways - that's when strange connections are made. The myopia of single field expertise is one of the ways in which insights are reached... I could cite a thousand examples of non-academic innovation that you use every day - innovations that provide the bedrock of your day to day life, but I think you're smart enough to figure that one out on your own.

Now pair academia with the free flowing consequence-free world of naive discovery and you have imagination and discipline both. You have 19 year old children discovering ways to create self driving vehicles (accomplishment?), simulating interstellar galaxies, or creating energy independence for their third world village. I'm not sure what kind of ""accomplishments"" you might be hoping for, but open source, free information and maker movements have profoundly and will continue to profoundly change the world.",1368947391,ca1mc4w,t1_ca1lynp,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2013

Of course all the basic like the time, temperature, showing you the route from A to B in an augmented reality fashion, letting you know the ingredients for whatever food you are making and when to put them in etc. But also more advanced stuff like if you are walking in the streets it would analyse possible danger before you would be able to do so yourself, giving you maybe 3 more seconds to get out of danger in a car crash for example, while also showing you the most optimal route to get out of the danger, with augmented reality. Or say that you are being in the store, just by looking at a product, information about that product would pop up like the prices in other stores for that product, reviews of the product, the use of the product etc. Or maybe you are walking in a forest/jungle and just by looking at a plant or animal important information about that plant/animal would pop up, maybe some survival tips would pop up too if thats needed.

311,CthulhusCallerID,"Continued from previous comment.

It's true that the deaf have traditionally been considered disabled by our society, and, in a literal sense, they cannot do something most people can do, but again, this is by our society. It's the majority looking at a minority and deciding that their being different makes them less than. The deaf themselves don't feel this way about themselves. They have unique challenges, but their challenges aren't all that dissimilar to those faced by an immigrant group that doesn't speak English (the immigrants have the advantage that they can learn to speak and understand spoken English, but the deaf are already native English readers and writers, so while an imperfect analogy, I feel like there's a reasonable balance to it). Or, to put it another way, if everyone in the world could sign (and I realize that different countries have different sign languages), then the deaf community in those countries would be, at most, slightly inconvenienced by their deafness. Where as even if everyone could read braille, blind people would still have extreme difficult navigating the world (they will be helped immensely by self driving cars). 

Just as a humorous aside, we can see that lacking a sense isn't always considered a disability in that while we do have words for a person who lacks their sense of smell or taste, virtually no one knows what they are (anosmic and ageusiatic, respectively). This tells us that just missing sense isn't enough for us to consider someone disabled. 

As for this question:
&gt;Is the advent of these new technologies really creating a new pressure or is it just an option that is being opened to them?

It does place a unique pressure on the deaf that very few other communities are going to face. As I said before, language is culture. In a world were everyone is hearing, sign language will be mostly irrelevant, it will be like the new Esperanto (fun fact: more people speak Tolkien's Elvish and significantly more people speak Klingon than speak Esperanto), relegated to an oddity. And we will lose things, it may not matter to the broader world, but the deaf are a culture with their own stories and shared experiences and jokes, not all of which can translate into verbal language. So one joke that translates but may illustrate my point, there are some signs that are themselves puns, the sign for 'pasteurize,' if what I was told by my speech therapist friend is correct, is the sign for 'cow' made while moving your hands across your face... or past your eyes. This joke translates because it plays off of something we can appreciate, but most of the jokes and puns probably aren't based on similar sounds but similar gestures.

While this transition is happening, the deaf community will experience a contraction. New children aren't being born deaf, the aging (assuming this is pre longevity) are dying off and some deaf people are just opting out, taking the ""cure."" 

Now, it may be more constructive to look at the gay community. No one would call being a homosexual a handicap, but the none-the-less, there are a lot of people out there who are homophobic and wouldn't want their child to be gay. Those people could, if we someday find what differentiates one persons orientation from another (is it genetic, epigenetic, environmental? Did you know that even genetically identical twins don't always share the same orientation?) then parents my select for straightness, after all, even if they don't consider themselves to be homophobic (and notice how I phrased that) they might still not want their child subjected to homophobia and so they might choose not to bring a child with a genetic or epigentic predisposition towards homosexuality to term. 

Now extreme pressure on the gay community is nothing new, but this particular pressure would be. Likewise, a similar pressure is already presenting itself to the deaf community as we can already screen for certain genetic causes of deafness. 

And, if you'll permit me to extend my reasoning in a way you may find too far, consider this: The solution to audism (the hearing community discriminating against the deaf community) isn't the elimination of deafness, any more than the solution to homophobia is making every child straight or the solution to racism is the elimination of the traits associated with people of color. 

This all ties in with my initial concern of there not being enough voices from those communities in our community.There aren't really any guarantees that because we make someone more intelligent that they will act ethically towards others, or that, even if they are attempting to act ethically, they won't be operating under beliefs that differ dramatically from the communities they are impacting. They may only want to push their own agenda which is influenced heavily by the culture in which they were raised. A hearing person sees a deaf person as disabled and so wants to 'cure' them. A straight parent sees homosexuals discriminated against and wants to spare their child from that. But what does that do to those communities?

As a nation that wants to maintain any kind of military edge you have to get on board with this technology, or risk your entire military becoming obsolete. 

Imagine that you have two equally armed and equipped advanced fighter jets approaching each other. They detect each other at the same distance. If one has an AI running it instead of a human it can check that the target meets the appropriate criteria and fire before the human. Maybe a second or two before, but if that means that your AI controlled jet fires and begins evasive action before the human reacts, then the combat is pretty much over. At this point your entire advanced air force is obsolete and you cede control of the skies. That's without assuming that you could make the autonomous jets faster and more nimble since they wouldn't have to protect a human inside of them. For an extra edge, team robot killing machines could fire intelligent missiles before the target was confirmed, letting those missiles veer off if it turns out to be a business jet instead of a fighter jet. 
  Point being, no serious military power is going to give up on the technology any time. The risk of your military might going obsolete is too high. 

 On a side note, the US military has been focusing on energy weapons like lasers recently. The current technology seems silly inefficient, but in an AI vs AI battle, the side that can kill at the speed of light has a serious advantage.

341,[deleted],"You're looking at it wrong.

Think of it this way - how many people actually drive for pleasure?  As in, get into a care and drive for the sake of driving?  Not many - even for the ones who really actively enjoy driving (I count myself among these) the enjoyment is mostly incidental, i.e. I'm motoring along and a highway or mountain road opens up in front of me, so whee.

I'm going to venture that almost all driving is done for some purpose - even that which people enjoy.  As in, they wouldn't go driving _for its own sake_.  Even people who road race mostly do this because they come across someone else who's doing just that - and most people who drive unsafely do so opportunistically - not because they set out to do so in the first place.  Make a safe, economical, comfortable, convenient, affordable grid of self-driving vehicles available for general use, and people will use it - you won't need punitive incentive.

Now here's the kicker - a well-designed such system will allow for that (very) occasional remaining pleasure driver - i.e. the guy who wants to take his antique car or motorcycle for a spin in the hills, someone wanting to put a sports car through its paces on a hilly road.  I claim that nobody in their right mind deliberately goes out searching for other traffic - thus removing most of the danger to other motorists, and this hypothetical system of fully autonomous cars, if properly conceived, would take corrective measures.  

Any residual risk, e.g. to pedestrians, would be so tiny as to be insignificant, as your true determined hobby driver isn't really a danger (again - you're talking about people who are enjoying the drive for its own sake, rather than some stressed out commuter or truck driver), and we needn't even bother discussing gasoline, as residual pollution from these hobbyists would be so infinitesmally small as to be completely negligible.  

Think of it like having a BBQ.  You burn wood/gas/coal because you _want_ to BBQ.  It's not an efficient way of cooking, it's not necessary, it's inconvenient, dirty, slow, but you do it because it's fun - you enjoy the process.  200 years ago, you not only didn't have the choice of whether or not to burn wood for cooking - you had to do it for heat as well.  We are currently in the 200-years-ago wood cooking/heating phase as far as cars go; 20 years from now we'll be in the hobby BBQ phase.

There is no ""honeymoon"" - people drive because it's often the only usable way of getting around, and because it gives them vastly more freedom and flexibility than any of the other forms of available transportation.

346,eno2001,"I agree with his notion that the way cars are sold needs to change to meet today's technological infrastructure.  My take on it is a little different though.  I think that car ownership is far too expensive for most people these days.  Think about the TCO of a car.  It is a HUGE part of your income if you are below a six figure salary.

I believe that as cars move towards being more automated devices (self driving and networking with other cars), the need to own the cars outright has less value.  There is a better way, both for the consumer and for businesses: follow a similar model to the mobile phone industry.

Instead of buying a car, paying for maintenance, and insuring it, you pay a monthly fee to get a ""Smart car"" which is self driving and comes in single passenger, double passenger and family sizes.  When these cars are on the roads they interact with each other in a symbiotic fashion by exchanging their destinations to allow them to group together in the most efficient ways.  Think about that for a bit.  You tell the car where you want to go and when the destination is set, your distance from intersection points is calculated along with speed to determine when you will be intersecting AND when cars already on the road will be at that intersection point.  This allows your destination and vehicle ID number to be sent to those vehicles so that they make allowances to add a new unit to the group.  The end result is that all vehicles now have the benefits of both individual cars and mass transportation.

Long before vehicles approach their exit to destination the cars that are continuing on around them know to make allowances and entire groups headed for that destination are shifted to the exit lane at just the right time, while other vehicles are moved to lanes where they can continue to travel uninterrupted.  I believe this is where we are headed.  The roads of the future will look like a clockwork grid of independent vehicles operating as a distributed machine, with lanes virtualized and able to change purpose as needed.  Even change direction in the event of any accidents or other events that would interfere with traffic patterns.

As far as the lease component goes, I see maintenance and insurance as being options that can be bundled in from the vendor.  The pricing would need to be low enough to give this industry a competitive advantage over the traditional model.  A monthly lease for a single person vehicle should be in the $49/99 range for just the vehicle and perhaps some included ""light maintenance"".  The double person vehicle should still be in the $100/120 range.  And the family vehicle should be in the $150-175 range.  Top that off with insurance, and better maintenance plans, and yes... the car should then be more in line with what a traditional month automobile payment would be, but... it includes insurance and maintenance.  This is the ideal way to exit the traditional model (are you hearing me auto makers?).

If the entire system is automated, think of how the cars can report hardware status back to a central point to determine the level of maintenance required.  If it's something that can be self healing, the vehicle takes care of it when it's not in use.  If it is something that requires deeper work, the local automated service center can send out an equivalent ""loaner"" which then swaps with your vehicle at a time when the vehicle is not in use (maybe you're at work, asleep, who knows?).  Your vehicle goes to the service center, has the needed repairs and swaps with the loaner at the next best exchange point.

Remember that TCO should also include the time you spend doing things FOR your car, because ""time is money"".  If the car can maintain itself in this nature, you're dropping even more TCO.  Anyway, just a few notions of mine that I think will happen within the next 20-25 years.",1370445682,caco6cw,t3_1fp96j,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2013

350,RaceHard,"Here are some reasons for having full auto:

* Space saved: Just think about it if all cars are fully automatic you don't even need to own a car. One will come to pick you up within minutes of a request, take you where you need to go and pick someone else. there will not be giant parking lots anymore, or DMV buildings. The space reserved for a garage on a building is now apartments or extra rooms on a house.

* Money saved: Traffic lights, signs, road rails, maintenance for those systems, etc. All gone, it could be used elsewhere, for other infrastructure.

* Time saved: Self-driving self adjusting cars, do not suffer from delays, they could literally crisscross intersections with no stop. Or drive at top speeds that human drivers would have to be professionals to properly maneuver.

If the cars were to be electric too then things change even more.

* Environmental consequences: All those emissions gone, no longer there as if by magic not more CO2 directly coming from vehicles anymore.

* Gas stations: They are now electric stations, clean, efficient, automated. No longer an environmental hazard.

* Weight of vehicle: It could be reduced using other more flexible materials, because collisions would be nearly impossible. Reducing cost overall. And increasing speed of manufacture.

* Time saved #2: No more need to waste neither money nor time learning to drive. So we can use those things elsewhere. It is no longer a worry.

* Kids: today if your teenage son or daughter want to go someplace far they depend on you. But with this they do not, they have more freedom of movement, and you have peace of mind. They could be shit wasted and there won't be an accident.

* Elderly: Same thing, they now have a greater freedom of movement without risk to themselves or others. You could be 90, half blind, and semi senile and still be able to visit your grandson 80 miles away. Having a pleasant and safe drive over.

* Space saved #3: You get a bigger trunk and a frunk! Plus extra seating space. 

* Accident containment: If an accident did occur, safety systems could call for help nearly instantaneously. Traffic would not stop, or slow down it would just shift to accommodate. Even if the damage to car would prevent it from calling for help the other cars would recognize the accident and send a distress. And if the vehicle is alone disconnection from the network would alert emergency services.

* Crime prevention #1: Stealing a car would be foolish, in fact impossible. And there would not be a need for it. How would you steal it if there no manual drive? What for, who would buy it? A car not networked is not a safe car and would be tagged. Besides the police would be all over before you got in the car.

* Crime prevention #2: No more getaway vehicles or drive by's. Impossible to accomplish, guardian system could detect firearm discharge and alert authorities even lock passengers in.

* Crime prevention 3#: No more street races.

* Efficient cargo movement: Think truck caravans moving state to state overnight, no rest, no stops. Shipping costs would go down, efficiency goes up. Time to your amazon delivery cut in half.

* efficient city-wide evacuations: The normal delays would not be present, there would no be jams or accidents.

* What purpose do those things serve? To aid human drivers, AI's do not need such things. Not required, then why have them? There is no liability issue, a street sign or a traffic light is meaningless to a self driving car, these are things for humans.

* Even without the ability to criss cross, they could still drive at a faster speed than the average driver without problems. No road rage, no stress, no sickness, no distractions.

355,RaceHard,"Are you mental, did you just seriously say that gas engines are efficient? And that electric motors are complicated?  And that electric cars weight more. Its like nah, I can't believe you make these claims not in jest.

* I can see how older batteries can be considered heavy. This is true, but if all cars are self driving and electric the frame could be changed to other flexible lightweight material.

* Gas stations store gasoline, and are a fire waiting to happen. Yes it is uncommon but it can happen. It is a numbers game, with the amount we have across the country accidents involving gas station can lead to fires that could be prevented. not mentioning spills, accidents and other issues with gas stations that could not possibly occur with electric ones. 

* Time spent learning to drive is time I could spend writing my thesis, but for most preschoolers its time they could spend learning something more productive or training for a physical sport. 

* Unlikely, this is why: GPS tracking satellite and/or cell tower controls. Lockdown, remote operation. The moment they try to open the door by force, a call can be placed. Besides they'd have to find a parked one. 

You could in theory ask for a car to come to you, but by then you are registered as the thief. Let's say credentials are stolen like a phone, the moment you make a move to interfere with the internal workings the car shutsdown and locks down. Stealing these cars would not be possible, besides supply and demand where is the demand when you can order a car with the touch of a finger?


* How do these cars take your freedom away? They just take your dangerous, fallible,and slow human afflictions out of the way. You still get to go where you want, when you want.

* Lets regard the energy and emission issue for a second. How the energy is generated is an issue, I'd say the best would be Thorium nuclear plants. All over the country. In the long term plan for Fusion.

As for energy efficiency, gas engines take a chemical and make boom. (yeah oversimplified) They are a risk and make of many moving parts, complicated and hard to fix. Weight a ton and require specialists.

Electric motors are simple, a copper coil driving magnetic forces. In reality a bit more complex but they have a handful of electric parts and are tiny. They deliver nearly all the energy stored, none wasted as heat. They can even break by infusing a magnetic field in reverse of what the wheel is turning towards. If replacement is required is a pop a new one in and done. Hell it won't even be your responsibility, it will be that of the car owning company or the gov. 

no oil changes none of the breaking fuel mess, no grime, no more stalled engines or overheating. All that stuff of the past.

It's a solved problem. Given laser, radar, infrared and standard cameras, etc, computers can perceive their environment much faster and more accurately than humans can. They're also not prone to shock, adrenaline, etc. We don't require humans behind the wheel for their object recognition. Decision making is a little bit trickier, but still not difficult. In fact, this is a social issue, really. Whether we, as a society, are ok with a computer intentionally killing the car's occupants in order to save a larger group of pedestrians is up for debate, but once we make that decision, the computer won't have any problems solving for the desired outcome. Crunching a lot of input data to arrive at a predetermined desirable outcome is pretty much exactly what computers are good at. And let's not forget that they don't have to be perfect, they just have to be better than humans. So yeah, probably not decision making either. Why DO we require humans behind the wheel, then? If it's not a performance issue and the safety evidence clearly favors self-driving cars at this point, why the people? Because we don't trust the cars yet. That's it. That's literally the only reason we require a butt in the seat.

-------------------
- (A lot of this is questionable in terms of time frame, but this is all stuff I'd like to work with in the story.) 
- Reality-like virtual reality with direct access to occipital lobe.
- Genetic modification of animals and plants.
- A system called ""TruView"" that uses visual markers placed on real surfaces to create virtual projections into the eyes of the viewer (which so far are applied to houses and such to make...the infinite kinds of visuals you could make if you can make wallpapers/clothing/furniture/etc look however you want it to).
- I am thinking of plants that are used to grow various products (from cups to furniture). Hell, even organic processes that produce polymers for home 3D printers or printing stations that reduce the need for actual stores and make it possible to have sustainable/recyclable goods.
- We would also inevitably engineer things that are neither plants nor animals, humans like to explore all potentials.
- Likely food-printing as well, assuming the above.
- Of course electric, self-driving automobiles.
- Better water sustainability systems.
- More widespread sustainable energy.
- We can restore flesh, limbs, organs. Still not sure where ""mortality"" lies, but the story would be on the boarder between ""maybe we're stuck as mortals"" and ""yeah there's inevitably immortals."" The socioeconomic factors obviously come into play here--what is the price of advanced medicine? Right to reproduce when people aren't dying? Rights to what level of medicine? Not meant to be the focus of the story.

**Random Implications of the Above**
------------
These techs make it possible for low-cost property and low-cost manufactured goods to look a lot better. Same with genetically engineered flora that can adapt better to specific environments. Thus a class of people with more control over their physical living environments (imagine houses that shift colors, plants designed to grow certain ways into the property, and even houses that are *literally* trees, etc).

With TruView you can illuminate areas without requiring true illumination -- it would be able to detect the world around you and overlay pretty much anything onto it. While I feel this is inevitable, I also wonder what it will do to society. I'd like to hear other people's take on it. I'm not completely sure if TruView is even viable or likely.

These things also reduce our manufacturing footprint by a lot. Being able to engineer biological processes is probably way crazier than I can think up alone. So many potential technologies come from that--biomanufacturing is how I feel ""nanotechnology"" will be in our reach, after all, biochemistry *is* nanotechnology. I'm trying to write in the period before we're able to engineer humans, however.

I have a bit of an obsession with the potentials of engineered plants, and this includes plants that...*cringe*...have advertising on them. Leaves growing in the Nike logo. Bark with patterns embedded in it. Butterflies with catchphrases on their backs. The amount of oversight necessary for this is absurd -- this is beyond the FDA, and there *will* be people highly opposed to this kind of stuff. Will people afraid of it be able to stop it entirely? It has crazy implications about our footprint on ecosystems, which is why I think there will be a big movement to only engineer in favor of sustainability and safe biodiversity.

This would also include weapons...I don't want to deal with writing about a new biological warfare, even though it may be inevitable, that would not be the focus of the plot. I suspect if people aren't dumb enough to drop nukes, they won't be dumb enough to release pathogens that would not be neutralizable, or risk destroying themselves and everyone else. Of course, also, if you can engineer diseases, you can engineer cures.

I'm also trying to write before high-level AI because I don't really know what will happen with that. I have ideas, but it can go down so many different ways, and honestly I don't feel up to the task of doing it justice. I'm integrating basic AI that is a few steps below sentience, but of course uses quantum computing, cloud computing, and even if not sentient...it would be absurdly intelligent and able to make better decisions than humans a lot of the time, thus would be integrated into a lot of our infrastructure...as is already beginning to happen now.

This could include AI that monitors biospheres, education, economic flow, media evolution, public opinion, etc.

------------
**Sociological Factors**
------------

I also have a couple different sections of the population:

- A group (Ecolotarians) of people that turn more towards organic integration with the world around us and fully sustainable living. This would include people opposed to modern tech, but also would have a dialectically opposed group that integrates with engineered biology.
- A new widespread religious doctrine that ties together a lot of modern faiths into a more unified and modernized spiritual group -- created by the new generation of people who remain spiritual but not as Orthodox as the past.
- A group of people that live mostly on the net and make their economic sustenance from lives on the net and the many new fields of work that exist in a more integrated technological landscape.
- Also want to address the socioeconomic dynamics. Curious at how things will turn out when certain constraints of resources are dealt with, especially as it regards the potential of truly genetically designed plants, animals, engineering foodstuffs that doesn't require the same kind of resource draw of the modern food market, etc. We know that resource abundance doesn't mean egalitarian spread of resources, but how long will that last in first-world countries?
- With regards to oil: at best we manufacture a replacement for oil (as in make a process that makes an oil equivalent for less money), at worse we have only: electric cars, maglev trains, and maybe some issues with international travel and absurd airline prices only accessible to the highest class (and probably new boats and other oceanic travel).
- With regards to scarcity: seriously think once certain techs get on their feet, food scarcity will not be an issue in industrialized countries. Water? I'm not so sure...Global warming is still an issue...",1370937671,caghnry,t3_1g3xh7,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2013

Current design concepts involve using ground based lasers to power it so you rid yourself of the weight of fuel.  But you are correct, I don't see it becoming economically viable until the end of the time frame given in this post. Maybe not even for a decade or more after.

One thing I did find interesting in a novel was the idea of using a space elevator where instead of a single cable of carbon nanotubes you have a loop. The loop is driven by the weight of water. Carbon nanotube constructed bags are filled with seawater and powerful motors drive the loop to pull them up into orbit initially. Once they pass a point on the cable they begin to pull the cable themselves as they are flung off into space for collection and use. That momentum drives the loop and pulls up more bags of seawater and other payloads.

It becomes a self driving space elevator that puts water where we are going to need it, and would likely not impact ocean levels in the timeframe where this is the most efficient means of getting to space.

391,randomsnark,"I realize we often prefer the more exciting world changing technologies around here, but I feel like this could be useful for making mundane things more convenient (and possibly automating jobs, which is always fun). One example is that this could be used for automatically tailored clothes - an app could use 3d data of the user's body to generate their measurements which could then be sent off to some company with a machine that would then churn out  clothing in your exact size in your preferred style (using something like [this](http://www.likeyourstyle.com/)) and ship it to you.

It's already easy to automate production of generic-sized clothing, but this could allow tailored clothing to be handled entirely by machines too.

It could either get an approximation from a picture of the user wearing clothes, or it could have permissions disabled for both file saving and network use (for the user's peace of mind) and calculate their exact measurements from a naked image which is then immediately deleted, and generate a url with those measurements in order to submit them to the tailoring service.

...yes, I've put thought into this before. I kind of wander around looking at all the products in the world around me and think about how they could be created without human labour, and clothes are one of the necessities which don't seem to have a ready-made solution yet, compared to self-driving vehicles, 3d-printed or prefabricated housing, automated food farming, etc.",1371596045,caljjpm,t3_1glbhh,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2013

While I admit to using sloppy wording, my argument is grounded in probability. I'm not just speaking about the US cellphone industry, but that of rest of the world's as well. Unfortunately at this point in time, Google stands unrivalled in R&amp;D spending, and their capabilities are superior. They have already monopolized so many sectors that the entry barrier is simply too high for equitable competition. They are changing the way people receive news, they've all but driven away competition in interactive mapping, Glass which requires Google products to operate, cloud computing, self driving cars  that require Google maps for direction. They were able to finance this stuff with funding from ad space from their world's largest search engine which is shifting to AI. Once they do that, they have the world's largest online information collection. Say you make a competing AI system, you are going to have to compete against a leviathan, with far superior access to information and coding. In order to change that, you would need to have high initial startup capital to even put a dent in them. Even then, good luck keeping up. The other path would be for the majority of people to become impassioned enough to sacrifice massive reductions in convenience to bear with an open source project or competing company until it reaches a point that it can be competitive with Google. Good luck, especially in the rest of the world, especially in the time it would take before people figure out that they don't have to pay to use the Google balloon internet with universal coverage.

396,randomsnark,"I agree with their first sentence though the rest is shaky. Crime tends to arise from poverty, greed, or psychological impulses. Some preliminary trials have shown that a guaranteed minimum income can reduce crime rates by 40%. On the other hand, people at the top of organized crime are not driven by poverty - they are incredibly rich. The key there is to stop crime paying as much, by targeting money laundering.  Without human trafficking, drug black markets, gun trafficking, and so on, organized crime makes a lot less money and has much less incentive to continue. Without organized crime and without poverty, crime would be much rarer, though not eliminated.

Obviously all of those ideas immediately run into political issues. There is debate over whether drug regulation needs to become looser or stricter to reduce a black market, and cutting down on gun trafficking runs into problems when those with political influence are finding it to be both a profitable and useful tool. Even human trafficking, which I would have thought to be the least controversial thing to forbid, runs into problems; I read a recent article in which Russia objected to a UN anti-trafficking resolution on the grounds that they will maintain their own internal affairs and don't want any external constraints telling them what to do about organized crime.

A guaranteed minimum income as a solution to poverty is equally controversial. It's ""socialist"", which is a dirty word, and to be fair it's not yet proven with a large sample size. There are potentially some technological solutions as well as political to poverty, which seems like it would be more up this subreddit's alley. One of the largest costs of living is housing - if things like Contour Crafting (which claims it will be able to print a good quality house for $20,000 in 20 hours) take off, the cost of living in the developed world and the quality of life in the developing world will benefit greatly. Actual income will not increase, but the ability to afford the necessities and still have excess spending power will have a huge boost. Other costs of living such as food and transport may be reduced by self-driving cars (lower labour costs involved in moving all goods), solar-electric vehicles (lower fuel costs) and aquaponics. However, housing remains the largest chunk of cost of living at the moment.

Obviously none of these issues involve a magic bullet. Crime involves organized crime, poverty, psychology; organized crime involves many different kinds of incentives; poverty is influenced by all the different aspects of cost of living (and economics); psychology is a small but complicated slice of the pie. I think the trick is to find the current biggest and most accessible slice and work on that, then re-evaluate. In that sense, the thing that is most interesting to me in terms of reducing crime is technological solutions to cheaper housing, but obviously there are a lot of other avenues where progress is slowly being made.",1371952936,caocho4,t1_caoc3rx,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2013

Second: Automation. Automated mines and transportation and package handling. Notice that with self-driving cars and the DARPA competition for a humanoid robot, and Rio Tinto wanting to automate all of it's mining trucks, we are not that far from this.

I don't think small scale 3d printing is necessary. With full automation staring up factories will take much less money. Maybe still too expensive for individuals but perhaps not too expensive to have factories for everything every few miles from each other or so.

&gt;Police/law enforcement: Would the public ever really accept a robocop? Crime scene and detective work especially seem too much to ever automate.  

Do we seriously believe that in a super-futuristic cybernated civilization we still need badges and billy clubs?  If you haven't figured out by now that cops only patch (not solve) problems that we and they create ourselves, no amount of technology is going to make your society any better.  

&gt; Military officers: Unless we're heading for a Terminator scenario, someone will always be pushing the buttons on whatever drones and robots we come up with next.

If the economy continues to operate on a model which has proven repeatedly in the last century, and especially in the last decade, and especially in the last 4 years, to be one of the worst inventions ever conceived, then no, we probably won't be able to automate ""business"".  Of course, if almost all jobs are automated, then either the economy will transition to one which doesn't require full employment, or there will be a dystopian period ruled by the rent-seeking owners of farms and factories.

But if you're wondering whether or not we could automate *the economy*, then the answer is yes; It would be similar to designing a large computer system.  Most of the complexities of the economy are self-imposed and encultured.  
&gt;Chefs: People will always cook, but will we always have chefs in a professional setting? If you can program a robot to add the exact same ingredients with even better precision and repeatability than a person, do we still cook our own food?  

Chefs are the ones that come up with the recipes, so unless you find a good way to algorithmically generate recipes, they will probably stick around.  Of course, this falls into the same category as entertainers: People who generally are doing what they love, and often do not have a good life as a result of doing it as a job (my boss at my previous job worked at least 90 hours a week)

The 101 is currently a four-lane highway, but they are putting in two more lanes right now.

So anyway, stuck in traffic on the 101 I realized those extra lanes were going to have a real impact on property values, quickly.  I'd say in 10 years time there will be enough self-driving cars on the road to make not just a change in the lives of those who own them but on traffic patterns and traffic jams.

439,SplitReality,"&gt; Your example goes against your point. That job was eliminated. I think what you're trying to say is that the number of jobs will shrink.

In my head it made sense. What I meant to say is that jobs for specific skill levels are going away, not shifting. Automation means that menial jobs will require fewer and fewer humans. If you doubt that I ask you what are the current low skill jobs that are on the increase that will take up the jobs being lost to automation.

&gt; In so much as things that currently have value and are treated as commodities would instead be treated as free things, like air is generally treated.

There will always be things of value based on scarcity. For example who gets the front row seats at a concert, or who gets the house with the scenic view? 

&gt; I expect different commodities to rise. Services won't vanish, nor entertainment, nor novelty.

No doubt that there will be services that are still in demand.  For example, rock stars for that concert that I previously mentioned. However the number of those jobs will be severely limited. We can't all be rock stars, and if everybody could do something then there wouldn't be much novelty. Besides once AI can match human intelligence an AI could be a one-to-one replacement for just about human position. I seriously doubt there would be huge demand for human made goods and services without regard to quality and for most things AI made things will just be better.

&gt; Standards of living will be universally higher. Also I don't expect the pace that many other expect.

There is going to be a painful transition, and things are going the exact wrong way (in the US anyway). In the US there are 3.1 job seekers per job and it is becoming increasingly controversial to increase unemployment insurance. I can't imagine what would happen if someone proposed a straight minimum income from the government. As automation puts people out of work, wealth will increasingly concentrate in the hands of the few, and they will fight and redistribution of that wealth back out to the masses.

As for the pace, I'm think it's going to come sooner and with more abruptness than many think. I read that IBM's Watson is already as good as a first year medical student. In ten years Watson should be better than most doctors when it comes to diagnosis, and I thinks that is being conservative. Online shopping will direct delivery will probably kill most retail stores in a similar time frame. We'll have automated factories shipping to automated warehouses that will be sold by web sites and delivered to you with self driving trucks. Sure there will be some humans in there but at only a fraction of what is currently needed. 

Once the threshold is crossed where the cost of replacing generic factory workers with robots is economically beneficial, it's going to be done at a lightning rate. When computers can reliably understand speech a whole bunch of white collar jobs will go poof overnight. 

At some point culturally we'll just start redesigning services so that they can be more easily be automated. For instance why can't a McDonalds be mostly automated. I can imagine one where the kitchen is much smaller with special made machines to prepare the food. An ATM style front could be used for food orders. Bathrooms and the seating area could have drainage systems build in the floors that can take food and waste. Cleanup could be done quickly with a pressure washer. One person on duty at a time might be all the was needed to handle such a purposely build restaurant. ",1373338100,cayo9oq,t1_cayl8aa,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2013

A car will drive itself up to an independently owned gas station that supports robotic full service, all of which would opt in to some industry list of participating stations. The car sends and authorization request to the pump wirelessly, similar to current RFID smart cards, though with better session encryption. The gas station's payment processor will approve the transaction, the pump will signal the approval to the car, the car will open the gas valve, and a robotic arm will ""dock"" the pump handle to begin fueling. Once the tank is full, the arm goes up, the gas cap closes itself, the taxation is finalized, and the car drives itself away.

It takes a common standard, but that already exists for current pumps. Gas stations are free to choose from Gilbarco, Wayne, or many others, and they have defined standards.

&gt;the notion that we must put our lives at risk every day to simply commute could seem very foreign, dangerous, and obsolete to a generation who grew up with self driving cars. 

Yes, this is related to the point of my previous post. Many of the dangerous things our ancestors did are obsolete and completely foreign to the average person living in a developed country.

Stats please. Somehow I think the lack of accessible heat, food, and reliable transportation can be more dangerous than you think. Also, those activities aren't as common now. I was talking about the past when everybody had to do those activities or die.

&gt;When you say ""popular,"" I guess you mean a terrifying niche of crazy people.

… You do realize the examples I list are popular at present? Sailing in particular has been obsolete for over a century yet still remains a popular recreational activity. No need to insult the participants and brush them off as being unhinged. I get it, you're not into risky outdoorsy activities. Doesn't mean the rest of the human race will follow suit. There are decades, if not centuries, of post industrial societies keeping risky and dangerous activities alive and thriving as hobbies backing my view up. My bet is that many of our post self driving car descendants will have access to tracks in which they'll be able to drive and race automobiles themselves. If anything, the ability to competently control a road vehicle without assistance from tech will be seen as impressive. This attitude can actually be seen to a certain extent today – drivers that are able to handle powerful vehicles well without driving aids, e.g. traction control, are seen as being skilled, not batshit insane.

&gt;Poor eating habits and recreational drug use en masse have plagued us since the dawn of man, and it's not going to end until we go extinct. Though I look back on the American butter obsession in disgust, it's one of those guilty pleasures that's been substituted with, in many cases, alternatives that can be more unhealthy in other ways (my concern lies in butter's societal over-consumption for extended durations, lending to widespread heart failure). All in all, most people look back on uncooked foodstuffs with disdain, but, at the same time, people will always eat many bad-for-you foods because they taste good. We have more healthier options in consideration of food and drugs than we did before, but the bad-for-you potential has also increased by many orders of magnitude because we want it.

I do not get your reasoning here at all. Certain dangers can be minimized with massive reorganization of infrastructure and hindering the population's ability to freely travel, but others aren't worth addressing because it's just human nature? If the government can force the entire population to adopt self driving cars and place a complete ban on human driven vehicles, it sure as hell can force us to eat better. Hell, it'd probably be easier to do. End corn/grain subsidies and instead heavily subsidize foods that are actually healthy. Also, you're argument that people will always eat unhealthy because unhealthy foods taste good can be used to support my position. There will always be people who enjoy ""dangerous"" activities because they are fun. Hell, even gun enthusiasts have the NRA. You can bet there will be a very well funded lobbying group for car enthusiasts if we ever go the ""people should not be able to drive"" route.

**Here's my reasoning:**

1. Today (7/15/2013) it would cost Google **at least** 14.71 *billion* to buy Tesla. That's just their market value and doesn't include the amount of money it would take for Elon Musk to sell a company that he's shown no interest in selling. (Although I think that Musk not wanting to sell would be a deal breaker today, anything could happen in the future.) If I had to guess I'd say it would cost Google $25 billion to convince Musk to sell. Last time I checked, Google has this sort of cash so not a complete dealbreaker.

2. This deal just doesn't make sense. You can say all you want, but there is not sane explanation for a company to go out and spend $25 Billion on a car company that is already overvalued at $15 billion.

465,[deleted],"Not every car is going to the same place. They still need to merge and exit and navigate their way around road-hazards and potholes, all of which will take time. It will make traffic move more smoothly and efficiently than it does currently, but the idea that it will magically allow us all to zip along and ignore the fact that we're sharing limited space with a whole lot of other people is pure fantasy. And even a single person driving a car him/herself or not following the standard protocols is going to fuck up all kinds of efficiencies that you'd need to make a dent in the speed of traffic. And even in the best of times it's certainly not going to come anywhere near the speeds you get with HSR.

And if the self-driving cars DO work out as well as everyone dreams, the incentive for car ownership will diminish substantially. Everyone will be taking abundantly cheap and efficient taxis in lieu of maintaining one car per driving age member of the household. So you still won't really have it be a viable option to rely solely on such taxis to take you out of town.

To further compound issues, not every car will have its cameras and software updated and properly maintained. Not every government is going to change or raise the speed limit. And to actually have any impact, *everyone* will need to have a self-driving car. There are still people out there who *prefer* a manual transmission even though it's less fuel efficient.

466,[deleted],"&gt; In my opinion, self driven cars are a more viable option in America because Americans are too ingrained in the idea of personal transportation.

New Yorkers are American. Not only that, but New York is filled with people from all over America so you can't tell me it's something in the water. Ditto for DC, San Francisco, and Chicago. These represent a good cross-section of the American cultural landscape and all 4 cities have more people who don't own cars than do (maybe not SF). These folks are no less American than people anywhere else, they just happen to live in a dense area where personal automobile ownership is prohibitively expensive, so they make the rational economic decision to not own a car. Not only do they make this decision, but they *like* the lifestyles they have as a result. People choose to pay rents in these places that are exorbitantly higher than elsewhere. When prices are high that indicates that demand is outstripping supply. Rents near transit options are far far higher than rents in places that are only serviced by roads. These empirical observation lead to an undeniable conclusion for anyone who understands basic economics: People want *more* dense, urban, walkability. Not less. No subjective beliefs necessary.

People talk about culture like it's this magic exogenous force that has no relationship to fundamental economic realities or evolving technologies. People can afford cars because the infrastructure to make it possible is paid for through transportation funding that privileges cars and is frequently hostile to mass transit, cycling, or walking.
Before personal automobile ownership was a huge thing, American cities were built around streetcar systems. Before WWII the public transit in American cities was second only to Germany. Back then people would have said taking cable cars from place to place was the American way of life. Changes in infrastructure spending priorities and marketing from the automobile industry changed that. At the time people actually argued against paving over vast swaths of farms, orchards, and neighborhoods to build huge freeways and interchanges because of the damage it would do to the American cultural fabric. Have you not seen *Who Famed Roger Rabbit?* There is no reason at all that the pendulum can't swing the other way. I don't know a single kid who doesn't think train-sets are fucking cool.

The culture argument doesn't have a leg to stand on because it's built on a weak premise. This idea that having a car somehow confers ""independence"" is a marketing gambit from the car industry that has about as much truth to it as the idea that Miller Lite has great taste/and is less filling. Your car will only take you as far as the government saw fit to build and maintain roads for it to drive on. This is no different from a train that only takes you as far as the government sees fit to build rail and run train service for you to take. And when 95% of the trips people make are along the same direction (there wouldn't be traffic otherwise), the only qualitative difference between a self-driving car and a train is that you're not sharing as much space. And you'll forgive me for not wanting to spend our transportation dollars on making sure people have themselves a luxury that yields such huge social costs.

Roads can achieve greater penetration than trains or buses, but whether you get them is still *dependent* on the government. In fact, car-dependent infrastructure is often at odds with every other form of conveyance. An area well served by transit is friendly to biking, walking, taxis, or car-shares. An area well served by free parking is hostile to everything but driving. Designing our communities so that they *require* car ownership to be a functioning member of society makes people *less independent,* not more.

&gt;In addition, I expect that to make self-driven cars profitable, whoever makes them will have to do software updates consistently

And are they going to start pulling people over on the highways if their software isn't up to date? 

&gt;Finally, you seem to point out a lot of possible flaws for self-driven cars while you seem to think that the flaws that were pointed out to you by other people (damaged tubes, new infrastructure, public preference, etc.) are somehow not big flaws.. o_O That's kind of ass-backwards.

I actually pointed out why the flaws people described weren't big flaws and then pointed out why the flaws self-driven cars have make the utopian vision proponents offer unlikely. There is nothing ass-backwards about it, it's called decision making where you evaluate the evidence on both sides of an argument and pick the better bet.

470,ajsdklf9df,"&gt;What is holding back the network from becoming a reality tomorrow?

The illegality of autonomous vehicles.

&gt;Who do we need to contact that is supporting/stopping the network? 

Your local politicians (state reps and senators if you are in the US). 

&gt;When do we want to make this network a reality? 

Ask your local politicians to legalize autonomous vehicles. In order of most to least effective:

1. By meeting them face to face, either through meetings for donors, or other meetings they hold available to the public.
2. Call their office.
3. Snail mail letter.
4. Emails. (So ineffective as not even be worth your time.)


--EDIT--

Here a specific idea about how to pushthe legalization of autonomous vehicles forward. 

Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) is a *very* powerful lobby. And they have successfully lobbied for many law changes. So I think this is a great example of how to lobby for the legalization of autonomous vehicles.

Autonomous vehicles for the safety of teenagers. A.k.a that old political trick: *For the children!*  For the children, teenagers must be allowed to be taken home by an autonomous vehicle. Teenage drivers are *dangerous*. They text, distract themselves with talking to their friends in the car, and drink and drive. They must be protected better with autonomous vehicles!

And most teenagers can't vote. And 18 and 19 year olds aren't exactly known to show up the polls faithfully. So they are a safe group for politicians to mess with. As it's unlikely there will be push back from these mostly non-voters.

And its easy to rile the people up with calls to do something to save the children. 

One option is to work with MADD to start lobbing for the legalization of autonomous vehicles as an aide or safeguard for teenage drivers. However, there has been some controversy with MADD. The founder left the group as it became more of a neo-prohibitionist thing. Oh America, how strange you can be to a European like me. Anyway, due to their obsession with alcohol MADD might not be interested in lobbying for autonomous vehicles.

So the best option might be to start a new nonprofit. The word ""Against"" works for MADD because drunkenness is bad! But I suggest this new nonprofit be ""For"" the safety and/or protection of children/teenagers. Politically it just sounds better.

Save the lives of teenagers with auto pilots for cars. Something like that. Something that sounds inspirational. Kids which died due to texting while driving, or all the other stupid shit teenagers do while driving, are an emotionally very powerful political message. Test data form the testing of the Google car today should show just how much safer the self-driving cars is than the typical teenage driver. Contrast the accident rate of teenagers with that of autonomous vehicles, and use that to hammer home the need for legal autonomous vehicles to protect the lives of our children. Hammer that point like a coked up monkey with a bag of walnuts and a hammer. 

Hold fundraisers to get money for your non-profit. Again, the stories of kids who died while driving is a powerful tool to use. Use the hell out of it. Grow your non-profit to be huge and lobby the living shit out of your state's politicians.

471,ajsdklf9df,"Soft AI is the stuff we have today. IBM's Watson winning Jeopardy, self-driving cars, software voice recognition, etc.

Hard AI is as smart as a God. Well technically it has to be at least as smart as a human, but if you get that far, you just hook it up to more hardware and it becomes smarter than any human, and from there on it's a short trip to Godhood.

You can't imagine what a super-intellect would think/do or why it would think and do. 

Never mind a God like super-intellect, try to write a plain human significantly smarter than you. You can't. You would be that smart yourself if you could. 

You can definitely see this in many works of fiction. None of the characters are smarter than the author. That's the top of any intellect in any story any author creates. It's why popular authors tend to be smart people. They have more room to work with.

So try this approach. Today we don't have hard AI. But we have different soft AIs specialized to be better than humans at certain tasks. Identifying cancer in X-ray images. Driving cars. Playing Jeopardy, etc. 

Just make your super-intellect that kind of specialist. It does not have a free will, but it can tell you exactly the optimal allocation of economic resources. It's far better at predicting the weather. Far better at simulating drugs and drug interactions. Etc. Just keep going. 

Drones and humanoid robots do all of the work, mining, farming, delivering, etc. It's all guided by a central soft AI. It can answer almost any question anyone asks it. No free will or God like intellect required.

475,SFTGFOP,"Hey cptmcclain, you have questions, I have answers. 

&gt;What is holding back the network from becoming a reality tomorrow?

Right now self driving cars are working their way through the regulatory systems. This could take some time even without opposition. However they do have major opposition in the currently established car companies. Let me lay out what the future looks like and why the car companies want to slow it down:

At some point a real mass market self-driving car hits the road. At this point people can buy a car that frees up their driving time to do whatever they want. What's more, services that sell rides or rentals can add these cars to their network. It eventually becomes clear that it's more economical and convenient just to have a car pick you up and take you wherever you want to go. Others have already expanded on this concept, so I'm not going to argue it here. From that point though, the decline of personal car ownership begins. Fewer cars are needed, as one car in a network can now serve 4-5 people who would have needed to own cars. Also, the market shifts from personal buyers to giant fleet buyers. That means thinner margins, and a more winner-takes-all market, like in smart phones where the top few phones get most of the business. You don't see several dozen airplane manufacturers competing to supply the airlines. So, the market for cars gets more competitive, margins go down, and the overall size of the market declines. This is a big win for consumers, commuters, the environment, the advance of technology, etc...; but for car makers it is hell. Some might emerge triumphant, but even winning in this smaller market may be less profitable than what they're doing now.

If you look at the time between now and that first real self driving car; car companies are poised to make big bucks charging premiums for ""fake autonomous vehicle"" technology. Those are things like parking assist, freeway assist, and other technologies where the car is mostly driving on its own, but if something unanticipated happens the car goes ""Oh shit, I'm handing control and responsibility back to you!"" In other words you can't safely collect Pokemon while using these features, and if you can't collect Pokemon while commuting, you're not in a real self driving car. During this time the car companies will charge thousands more for these features. They don't want to see this end.

Last point here is that car companies are talking a big game about making advances in self-driving cars, but they have yet to show a car that can handle itself like the Google car. Even if they did have that technology, they might not have the deep maps that Google has; and a real self driving car really benefits from those maps when navigating. The truth is that if a real self driving car hits the market, and is affordably priced, it will crush the sales of everyone who can't match the technology. Remember VZ Navigator, Verizon's Smart Phone OS, it was crazy expensive and very limited in what it could do. The iPhone buried it. Expect real autonomous vehicle technology to do the same to ""driver assist"" cars. As an example, imagine that Hyundai licensed Google's technology an rolled it out in all of their models in 2015. Would you pay more for a traffic assist feature that requires you to keep your hands on the wheel on on a Mercedes while some Accent owner can sleep through his commute. No luxury feature is going to compensate for that disparity in convenience. If you can't match it than you're going to have to license the same technology and watch your sales drop every year until you release it. That's assuming that the first companies to roll it out don't have a 2-4 year exclusive, in which case you're desperately trying to develop your own or license it from someone else. If you're late to the market you could go from number one to irrelevant, like Blackberry. 

So yeah, these are the reasons that I'm pretty sure that car companies are stalling as hard as they can. They talk about needing to establish standards to cars can communicate with each other, smart intersections, and technology in the roads that guides the car. They want to push those things because they'll take time, and cars built to take advantage of them won't be versatile enough to go everywhere. They're all stalling techniques. 

&gt; Why is the network not set up today?

Good news, the network is already being set up. Companies are fighting to be the dominant player in serving you up cars on demand. You've probably already heard of them, and pardon me if I leave some out. Uber, Lyft, Sidecar, Zipcar, Relay Rides. All of these businesses are cute right now, but add self driving cars to their fleets and they can compete to lure you away from owning your own car.

Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar all deliver a car to you, and take you to your destination. By using personal vehicles, Lyft and Sidecar cut their costs below taxis. Uber is following them into that realm. Imagine what their services would cost to use if you entirely cut out the cost of a driver. Imagine you could sign up your car as a driver on one of those services and it could ferry people around all day and night while you're working or sleeping, making money for you. They already have apps that allow you to book a ride from your phone. That technology doesn't need to be updated at all to add in cars that drive themselves. 

Zip car, and Relay Rides book you a vehicle for a certain time. They're currently limited to customers who have easy access to a vehicle close by, but what if the vehicle can come to you? All of the sudden their possible customer base grows dramatically. 

Beyond them, current rental car companies already have the fleet maintenance competency to jump into the market. 

Make the car available commercially, and all of these services instantly become feasible, and I'd argue that they're secretly designed in anticipation of self driving cars. They're just keeping quiet because they don't want to spook the current market. 


I'd say that the moment that the first commercially available self driving car hits, things start to move very quickly. They need only be available in California for other states and countries to clamor for them.

481,nosoupforyou,"&gt;Due to most people (not just drunks) now using this as their primary mode of transport, many people no longer need to own their own car and traffic congestion decreases. The rate of road fatalities also drops drastically since the human element is now removed from the equation. And once it is globally adopted, this technology results in a massive decrease in CO2 emissions. 

I don't really understand why traffic congestion would decrease.  Sure, in your scenario, most of the vehicles are jonnycabs.  But just as many people are being driven around as before. Sure maybe they can share the ride, but I bet the chances of that actually happening is low.

First, many people won't want to share a ride with a stranger, especially if the driver is a robot. It's an issue of safety.  This is especially true if you've been drinking.

Second, unless you're travelling during rush hour, chances of going the same way as someone else at the same time, being near enough to them to pick them up, and sharing the same direction, is not all that great.  Chances are better than the cab will end up travelling an extra few miles between picking up that extra party and the two destinations.

In addition, the technology may make it more likely for people to go out, actually adding to congestion.

Also, you've got a high cost to the cars.  $30k?  Why so high? Are you averaging between regular cars and the prius?

That's pretty high.  Especially once self driving cars are out.  It's theorized that insurance will actually drop fantastically once they are common just because the number of accidents and claims will drop.

What's that?

&gt;Fuel: $3,500

Wow.  When I was driving 33 miles to work each way, I was spending $60 per week on gas.  That's only $3120 per year.  Gas has actually gone done a little bit since then.  Of course I was getting a wonderful 25 mpg.

&gt;Tyres: $400

Huh?  Since when do you replace tires annually?

&gt;Servicing: $600

I spend that now, but on my 10 year old car.  With the newer car, it's pretty much just oil changes.

&gt;    Parts: $650

You beating on your new car?

&gt;    Parking/Tolls: $400

What?  With self driving cars, what parking costs will there be?  Tolls, those shouldn't be here as they will be charged to you whether you  are riding your own car or a jonnycab.

&gt;iCabs could also charge more $/km if you have luggage or weigh a lot (relative to height) due to the car needing more battery power per extra kilogram - thus putting a clearer monetary value on the cost of being overweight. 

Or generating a reason not to use jonnycabs and use your own car instead.  Because being overweight will so very much effect fuel efficiency.  Why not charge per pound instead of relative to height?  If someone weighs 250 lbs but is 7 ft tall, is he more fuel efficient than someone who weighs the same but is 5 ft tall?

They depreciate in value every year that you own the vehicle. You can't exactly improve it or make it better. You have to continue to pay for maintenance on the vehicle. You also have to pay for gas. And insurance. Cars, in generally, are a gigantic money sink. Even getting a used vehicle is difficult, financially. 

But having one is so vital for most people's day to day lives. Unless you happen to be a lucky person who works from the home with a grocery store across the street in a city with awesome public transportation and you're close to a route where you can get on the buses to take you to the popular social venues in town. You better be, at least, because unless you have extremely nice altruistic friends they're going to be annoyed by your lack of reliable transportation. You could also just ride a bike, but that's problematic in bad weather unless your willing to tolerate it. Some people can... most people can't.

I think people who know how to drive will probably retain that knowledge for quite a long time, but I'm willing to bet young kids today and kids being born will never learn how to drive, because they won't need to. Why would a human being need to drive a vehicle when there's a machine that communicates with all the other vehicles around it and can see 360 degrees around itself in a several foot radius at all times? If for some reason this system comes off line, institute a backup fail safe system that forces the car off the road until assistance can arrive. Annoying, sure. But you know what else is annoying? Putting your life at risk every day by sharing the road with people who are falling asleep or reading or texting or yelling at their kids or petting their dog or getting distracted by bright lights or eating dinner or suddenly going blind or forgetting to check all their mirrors or answering their phone or getting nervous about a cop behind them and clicking their seat belts or just looking away for five seconds because some idiot ran across the street. We're human beings, prone to distraction and very hard to discipline. And the majority of us sit behind the wheel of a multi-ton vehicle every single day.

And then one day, man went the way of the mule.

Some 5.7 million Americans are licensed as professional drivers, steering the country's vast fleets of delivery vans, UPS trucks and tractor-trailers.

Over the next two decades, the driving will slowly be taken on by the machines themselves. Drones. Robots. Autonomous trucks. It's already happening in a barren stretch in Australia, where Caterpillar Inc. CAT -0.10% will have 45 self-directed, 240-ton mining trucks maneuvering at an iron-ore mine.

Most of the hubbub around autonomous technology has focused on passenger vehicles, notably Google's GOOG -0.26% promotional wonder, the Google Car. Ford Motor Co. F +0.35% Chairman Bill Ford Jr. says self-driving cars will hit roads by 2025. But commercial uses are where the real money and action lie: rewiring a massive part of the U.S. economy while removing tens of billions in costs from a commercial fleet that today numbers 253 million trucks.

Ubiquitous, autonomous trucks are ""close to inevitable,"" says Ted Scott, director of engineering and safety policy for the American Trucking Associations. ""We are going to have a driverless truck because there will be money in it,"" adds James Barrett, president of 105-rig Road Scholar Transport Inc. in Scranton, Pa.

Economic theory holds that such basic changes will, over time, improve standards of living by making us more productive and less wasteful. An idle truck with a sleeping driver is, after all, just a depreciating asset.

Driving a truck will become automated over the next two decades.

But watching a half-decade of lagging U.S. employment, it's hard not to feel a swell of fear for those 5.7 million people, a last bastion of decent blue-collar pay.

A world without truck drivers may eventually be a better one. But for whom?

At least better for trucking-company owners, who today grapple with driver shortages of as much as 15%, in addition to perennial hassles of fuel costs, regulations and crummy margins. ""Holy s—,"" exclaims Kevin Mullen, the safety director at ADS Logistics Co., a 300-truck firm in Chesterton, Ind. ""If I didn't have to deal with drivers, and I could just program a truck and send it?""

Roughly speaking, a full-time driver with benefits will cost $65,000 to $100,000 or more a year. Even if the costs of automating a truck were an additional $400,000, most owners would leap at the chance, they say.

""There would be no workers' compensation, no payroll tax, no health-care benefits. You keep going down the checklist and it becomes pretty cheap,"" adds Mr. Barrett of Scranton, who says he can't find enough drivers.

Drivers call this nonsense. ""People come up with these grandiose ideas,"" says Bob Esler of Taylor, Mich., who has been driving a truck since 1968. ""How are you going to get the truck into a dock or fuel it?""

Of course, the real costs are hard to peg. Most experts on autonomous vehicles say that at least initially, the robot trucks will have to run on roads separate from regular vehicles, or via embedded roadside beacons. That won't be cheap.

And then there is the primary issue of safety—of the cargo and people on the roads. Most in the industry believe that machines should eventually become better drivers than humans. It is going to take a long time to prove the case to governments and the public. But a payoff awaits. The U.S. government estimates the costs of truck collisions at $87 billion a year, with 116,000 people either killed or injured in truck and bus crashes.

Safety is why so-called ""closed-course"" uses, which keep automated trucks away from the public, are happening first. That brings us back to that Australian mine, in a scorched, wretched area called The Pilbara.

It's where Caterpillar is today running six automated model 793f mining trucks. Stuffed with 2,650 horsepower and more than 25 million lines of software code, they haul away layers of rock and dirt, up and down steep grades. Traditionally, these trucks would require four drivers to operate 24 hours a day.

Today the trucks use guidance systems to run on their own, only monitored by ""technical specialists"" in a control room miles away. If an obstacle appears in its path, the trucks have enough onboard brain power to decide whether to drive over or around it.

In addition to safety risks, human drivers ""will often make judgments, most good, but some bad, and those inconsistencies can lead to problems,"" says Ed McCord, the Caterpillar executive in charge of the program. Automated trucks never flinch, he says. ""If it's supposed to be in fifth gear coming down a grade, it will be in fifth gear every time.

Eventually there will be 45 of these trucks on site, eliminating most of the need for 180 driving positions, according to Mr. McCord. The fewer remaining jobs, he said, pay better but be more technical — at their core, about software.

""The manufacturing job of today is a technician's job,"" adds Mr. McCord, who started his career 40 years ago demonstrating hydraulic excavators. ""The manufacturing job of yesterday was pure labor.""

That's a worthy way to understand the future of the truck driver, if we can even use that term. Just imagine, for instance, a supermarket ""driver"" who rides inside an automated truck, delivering packages and selling services instead of worrying about red lights and right turns.

This changes the nature of work itself—from hard skills to soft skills. It makes today's Teamsters into tomorrow's concierges.

One day, your grandchildren will be wondering, as they do about the rotary phone and the VCR. ""Truck driver! What was that?""

What will you tell them?

490,cjw2211,"I'm not sure what you mean.  What are most people thinking of when they think of a flying car?

Even if we did develop some antigravity tech, the only real reason I could see that flying cars would be needed is if the population becomes too large for roads to sustain.  I think that self-driving cars may eliminate a lot of traffic issues.  Additionally, population growth rates in developed countries are beginning to decline, and since developed countries have higher car ownership and people who commute (and thus are where a lot of traffic occurs), then the traffic issues we are seeing may start to level off due to a stabilizing population. 

If we're talking about flying cars that aren't achieving any real height and are simply hovering a little above the ground like a maglev train, then that's certainly feasible, although I don't know if that's really a ""flying car"" so much as a hovercraft that will allow us to remove strain from the roads and stop spending money on tires.  Otherwise I think airspace regulations are much too strict to allow flying cars that will achieve any real height (at least for the next century or so).",1375028624,cbc065j,t1_cbbx0dy,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2013

Flying ""cars"" today are just VTOL aircraft that need landing fields and air traffic controllers, just like any other aircraft.

Nobody would accept a propeller-based flying car in a city environment... even if we managed to computerize and automate them, the sheer noise from hundreds of them at once would be brutal, to say nothing of the wind issues and other things. 

Just because someone calls a VTOL aircraft a flying car doesn't mean it actually qualifies as one, and the other flying car I know is the Terrafugia - and that's more an airplane that can be driven on the road with its wings folded.

3 - One car can be shared between multiple people.

4 - When going out you won't get lost! Explore the world as you please.

5 - Safety on the road will improve drastically. A self-driving car means no senile drivers on the road, no drivers with ill tempers, no drunk drivers, no sleepy drivers, etc.

6 - You will save money. Less accidents means cheaper insurance. Cars being able to efficiently map out routes means less money spent on gas/electricity. Also, because you can share a car, potentially you could save on car ownership.

I forsee a great many people simply buying into a car service. I drive a car maybe 3 hours a week. The other 165 hours it is sitting there being useless and taking up space.

In that same vein, car park operators will take it in the shorts, because the cars won't be sitting around for 165 hours a week. They'll be shuttling around picking people up and dropping them off, then return to some remote facility for cleaning and maintenance, or just to sit idle during off peak hours.

And because people are merely using cars like taxis, and everything is routed by computers, car pooling will become incredibly common. Pick up your phone, call for a car. Click the carpool option to 'yes'. You get a discount, and the car goes a couple minutes out of the way to pick up someone else going to the same general location. This also eliminates the traditional headache of car pools, since there is no need to coordinate, its just handled automatically.

Take all those things together, and you're looking at an enormous drop in fuel use per passenger mile, especially for commuting to work, since large numbers of people are going to and from the same general locations at the same time. 

Why would people do this? Because it will be so much cheaper than personal ownership of a car. If the company only needs 1 car for every 10 people enrolled, that means you need to pay 1/10th the price of that car. You can enjoy rolling around in a 100k car on a blue collar income, or roll around in a kia as a poor college student. 

Plus, car maintenance will be proportionally lower. With how bad most people are at even getting their oil changed, average fleet lifespan will extend greatly, and these car services will *heavily* lobby the car manufacturers to create ever more reliable cars. 

In fact, car services may be the only way for the common middle class family to afford a self driving car initially. I imagine the first couple of generations will be very expensive.

Why don't we use vehicle fleets right now for regular transportation? The answer of course is the driver. Currently, the economies of scale of taxi fleets are completely wiped out by the cost of employing a driver at $30k-60k annually. A self-driving car replaces that driver with a few thousand dollars worth of electronics.

All you'll pay is gas and a massively distributed percentage of the cost of the car and its insurance. Self-driving cars will also have other effects that didn't exist in the horse to car transition. They will clear up huge amounts of space in cities. Who knows what that might lead to. They'll also clear up a lot of space in the wallets of those who are already wealthy enough to afford a car.

This is true, but I think the factor that will speed the adoption of self-driving cars is the fact that you won't need to front the expense of a new car. In fact, quite the opposite.... you can subscribe to a car fleet and get all your transportation needs fulfilled.

I imagine if I need a new car in 2030, something like this will be my options:

- $600/month for self-driving car payments
- $200/month for subscription to self-driving car services, plus save on gas and insurance.

This won't be an issue with self-driving cars, so far less total cars will be needed to fulfill transportation needs. Total car production required will be far less.

if the car drops to manual mode when it encounters something it can't handle it's useless, the driver shouldn't be expected to be paying attention and ready to take control if the car has issues, other wise why would he have a self driving car? if the car manufacturers can just drop to manual mode with any problem then when something goes wrong it becomes ""driver error"" and not their fault, so why would they even try to iron out the wrinkles, they have no skin in the game, just drop to manual mode with the slightest issue.

i say if you wanna make self driving cars they MUST be able to operate without a driver, and the creators of the car must take responsibility if something goes wrong. dropping to manual mode is the one thing that can totally ruin the future of self driving cars.

The total world population at the time was [6.2 billion](http://www.who.int/whr/2004/annex/topic/en/annex_2_en.pdf). Meaning the overal chance of dying from those causes is .05% per year globally.  Take into account thats for everyone and if you are not in an at risk group for violence (ie solider or citizen in a war torn nation), not at extreme risk of falls(ie highrise construcion worker, mt climber), at lower risk for drowning (ie not a toddler) and your chances of dying from those causes is much lower. Lets go easy and say that the probability of a non risk group individual is half that of an at risk individual (I would bet its much less).  The probabbility of dying after 1000 years at a .025% chance per year is 22.2%.  Couple that with the fact that violent deaths have been on the decline for centuries, reparative medicine is sure to make some strides in the next 1000 years aiding you when you do have a fall or other injury, in home fire prevention systems being an option as well as many other risk mitigation options available to the infinite longevity crowd and that number is even lower.",1394218445,cfwwado,t1_cfws5xd,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2014

The article admits that there are already computational things that a computer can do better than a human, but dismisses them because they are single purpose.

I don't need or want my self driving car to have a favorite sitcom. When computers can do 95% of what humans can do, what does it matter if it is accomplished with a single intelligence or multiple single purpose computers?

My second issue is that the article assumes that there is only one way for computers to be intelligent and that human beings have a monopoly on it. It doesn't consider that computers could become intelligent by entirely different means than humans, just like airplanes don't need to flap their wings like a bird in order to fly. 

Finally, this article doesn't consider exponential growth of computer technology. The basic gist of the article is that progress in the field has been painfully slow so we should expect it to continue to be painfully slow in the future. My own belief is that progress will continue at an accelerating rate. That progress will continue at a perceived slow pace until it hits a tipping point.

Medical research, for instance - a sufficiently well trained chimp could set and splint a broken leg, but a broken *brain* is a *whole* different level of difficulty. As complexity goes up, research speed goes down.

As for huge societal changes, people also completely underestimate the paralyzing force of capitalism. Self-driving cars are a stupid idea, but most people don't see that because they attribute completely outsized value to roads and cars themselves. 

If you're going to have self-driving vehicles, it's stupid to try to do that in the most difficult way possible - by retrofitting the self-driving bit onto a technology that has always been the way it is *expressly to accommodate the human drivers*. Instead of keeping roads and making cars self-driving - and we're still far from having any self-driving car that can handle all road and weather conditions - we should scrap the roads and make self-driving ultra light elevated rail based solutions that we *can* - and quite easily - automate to work in any weather conditions with near-perfect safety to boot, and the vehicles can run off power coming down the rail so zero pollution and far simpler cars. Plus, of course, that in such a system we could jack up transit speeds massively compared to roads where we currently top out at 400km/h - and anyone traveling at that sort of speed on rubber wheels gets 3 miles per gallon in fuel use and can insta-die at any point due to exploding rubber tires.

We have a ton of problems that aren't at all technological to solve, and in fact if we don't solve the societal issues first by scrapping capitalism and going to something cooperation-based it doesn't really matter how optimistic guys like Kurzweil are - we won't have the peace, order and stability required to implement meaningful changes.",1394606401,cg0j5sp,t3_2062lp,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2014

I think part of the problem here is that unless you are in the business, you don't appreciate how much work goes into IT software/hardware.  Somebody dug those ditches for the fiber and someone else wrote the code for your browser, OS and Reddit.  Line by line.  Automation can only do so much.

I think the reality is that to be successful now, given the pace of innovation, is that everyone should be thinking how to manage their own obsolescence.  Again, Google is a perfect example of this.  Why are they so interested in self-driving cars?  Is it just to save lives?  

Of course they would like you to think that, as it plays into their whole ""Don't Be Evil"" socially progressive mantra.  The reality is that their most lucrative AdWord revenue comes from auto insurance, which would be jeopardized by safer cars.

116,KingPickle,"&gt; That point will come within 100 years if something doesn't change. And what will? I can't think of anything.

A lot of changes are either already in motion or on the horizon:

* Automation and robotics will replace more and more jobs. That will mean a lot less commuting to work. On top of that, the people who lose their jobs will have less money to spend meaning they'll cut back on non-work-related travel and material consumption as well.

* Of the jobs that are left, increasingly efficient ways to communicate and collaborate over large distances will further decrease the amount of commuting needed. I think that VR will play a big role in this.

* Those same communication advances will lessen the need to commute for social reasons. Why drive to my friends house when I can hang out with him in VR?

* Self-driving vehicles are set to transform how we do commute, when we still need to. Ride sharing and optimized routing will allow for less fuel needed overall.

* 3D Printing, robotics, vertical farming, etc. are set to transform how physical products are created and distributed. It will take awhile for all of this to ramp up, but eventually our need to mass produce, package, store, and transport goods should drastically decrease. Just create and buy locally instead, on demand.

* Speaking of goods, more and more goods are becoming digital. Once VR and AR kick into high gear, and we spend more of our time interacting in a virtual space we'll need even less. For example, a meeting at work won't need to take place in a physical room, at a physical table, with physical chairs. Instead, we'll telecommute to a virtual meeting space.

I'm sure there's a lot of things I'm missing here, but hopefully you get the idea. A lot of the technologies on our horizon seem to me like they have the potential to disrupt our normal mode of operation. And as they do, I think we'll see a stark decline in the amount of energy needed.",1394967845,cg3vjyi,t3_20jeuz,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2014

Anyway, the next order of retail after that is the artisinal, specialty goods bought for their personal touch and craftsmanship, and often the experience of interacting with their creator or an expert will be part of the experience of these products.

VR. We will need spaces in which to run around and not bump into things and even meet other people in the flesh while playing in VR spaces.

But large spaces where we can interact with others, environments for large scale interactive VR play. Zombie wasteland environments, or Halo or Skyrim or GTA V or whatever.

Now my idea of getting away from it all involves a handheld device with 35x the RAM that was in that computer and close to immediate access to nearly everything ever written, recorded, or filmed.

Point being I don't see how it's realistic to expect people to ever just reach a point of technological development where we're all just universally like ""that's cool, we've accomplished enough, let's just chill and watch sports forever"".  The only reason we even have a capacity for boredom is so we never do that.  There is always the possibility for more, and we insist on it.  Like, do you want to vacation in the center of the sun?

[Look at these charts,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source) particularly ""Estimated Levelized Cost of New Generation Resources, 2018"".  Other than solar there isn't a large disparity between energy costs of the alternatives and fossil fuels. This isn't some mother earth news article, its the US DOE report on where we stand in just the next few years.  We have 40 years of oil left **minimum**.

Cost of renewables will go down in the future, costs of fossil fuels will go up, the increased energy demands will be met by renewables in the coming years not in the 40 years it will take to run out of oil. I assume you're not talking about coal running out considering we have an estimated [194 years remaining](http://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=coal_reserves) if we don't find another single reserve in that time.

There will still be fossil fuels in the ground even when we want them the most, because it will be just idiotic to try and get at them - the effort would not warrant the benefit.

Matter of convenience and cost.  If you use your car a lot, it may easily be more cost effective to own rather than rent.  If you only use it sporadically, then it's probably better to own.

Convenience because you won't have to wait for the taxi to come to you.  The car will be waiting on you.  

&gt;It would need parking or round trips every time you ventured out.

But it's parking it can handle itself.  Rounds trips too.  Better than a taxi because you won't be paying while it's waiting for you outside.  This, especially in bad weather at a grocery store, is important.

Check out how the Leadenhall Building in London is being constructed. Lots of pre-made parts, the whole thing built in software first, then built in reality. Now imagine self-driving trucks. And now imagine humanoid robots capable of following the build instructions the software used to simulate the construction. 

Not in 5 years. Well, self-driving cars are here already, they probably will be on sale within 5 or so years. But humanoid robots might be 10 years away. That's a conservative estimate. Another 10 years for them to become capable of working on construction. That's just one generation, and a stunning percentage of jobs is automated.

What happens someones self driving car fails to spot some kid in the cross walk and they aren't paying attention to intervene? That person, the person in the drivers seat must be held responsible at the end of they day even if they are no longer driving.

Maybe that person in tern goes on to sue the manufacturer for their losses or both parties go after the producer of the car but an actual person or party must be held accountable for the actions in the same way they are today with more directly controlled machines.

If you go to the hospital and receive care from a robot, that robot needs to be at the control of a physician responsible for overseeing it, double checking the work it does, and getting sued when something goes wrong.

I think there are examples where the water gets muddy but nothing that can't be overcome with sound reason.

Legally I think these cases will still be less complicated than ones where are multiple different individual parties involved all able to point fingers at each other for the blame.

Look at the sub prime scandal that drove the 2008 housing market collapse. There were so many people involved in small enough portions of what went wrong there was no one place to squarely lay blame. Are the banks wrong for giving sub prime loans, are they wrong to sell off packages of sub prime loans to the market? Are the independent appraisers wrong for rating bundles of sub prime mortgages as AAA? Are the people who shorted those bundles of sub prime mortgages wrong expecting the value to drop? Are the people who adjusted the adjustable interest rates high wrong? 

When taken as a whole there was clearly fraud but no single party was responsible enough for the big picture.

Then if an accident occurs we check the onboard black box to make sure the car behaved as we expected it to. If it did there is no blame. We then analyse the data and make any changes to the design necessary so that it doesn't happen again, or if it truly is a freak accident then we just let it go. 

If on the other hand we find that the car did not behave as it should we find out if negligence is involved and apply blame there.

In the end we just have to accept that even though automation can reduce the number of accidents, they are still going to happen.

Replacing normal cars with self-driving cars is kind of the opposite effect: we'll be giving up individual agency to the computers that will control our cars.

Even when it's self-driving, it'll still need maintenance, unless of course you think it really makes financial sense to outsource everything at a markup instead of doing it yourself.

In the past 3 years, electric cars sales have gone from &lt; 5,000 a year to ~190k. While a 370% jump in sales in 3 years is remarkable for any industry, this sales trend is slowing (it was about 150% from 2012-2013). When one further considers that ~15 million cars are sold in the US, annually, there is still a long way to go before this newer form of vehicle becomes ""the norm."" I would think self-driving cars will be much the same way. 

First, it will take at least 5-10 years to make such vehicles street legal. It didn't take electronic cars as long as they are fundamentally the same form of operation. Some states would allow it, others won't, there would have to be some form of interstate regulations set-up for interstate travel of such vehicles. There would have to be a change to the licensing process, even for ""self-driving"" vehicles. Given the pace politicians move, especially when you could have the automotive, and possibly the oil industry, lobbying against such a radical change, this could take at least a decade. 

Second, I imagine, at least at first, the price of such technology would be more than cost prohibitive -- as it had been with electric cars. 

Third, I don't know if the majority of drivers would be comfortable giving up operation of a motor vehicle. For there to be a major paradigm shift, it would require a majority of the customer base to make such a jump. 

I'm not saying it isn't going to happen but I think to make a statement that a child born today, in general, will never know about manually operating a vehicle is just a bit far-fetched.

This was devastating, because not only did it suck to have to make the trip, but that was a day that they weren't accomplishing anything else, not to mention consuming resources. Once they got cell phones, they could call and save themselves the trouble if it was closed. Prior to cell phones, this wasn't possible, because there was no land line infrastructure.

Money, of course, is an issue. SDC's are very expensive, but the cost will come down.

Now there are fewer jobs available than there are people who are unemployed and this difference is only growing as our technological advances accelerate.  You talk about new things and new goals, but a lot of what we're doing now involves getting rid of old things that we don't need anymore as well.

Take a simple example:  the driver.  How many people in the US have a job description that is essentially 'drive a vehicle from point A to point B'?  Easily in the millions, right?  Well, now we are a short ways away from having self-driving vehicles that could do the job better (Google's prototype has had 0 accidents total) and more efficiently than humans can.  So what are all these people going to do?  Pretending that you can spontaneously conjure millions of jobs from thin air when this happens is every bit as naïve and idealistic as you regularly accuse people who tout basic income of being, so what is your solution?  And what about service jobs?  Most people working at McDonald's could be replaced by machines that do the job better and don't whine about how shitty is tomorrow.

The fact of the matter is that, like it or not, something like basic income is really the only (humane) way forward.  Our alternatives are either going 'Survival of the fittest, bitches!' and letting these people fight each other for scarce and terrible low-level jobs just to get by until they have enough and destroy the system, or deciding to keep the jobs and stop the automation, which would be an immediate halt to the march of progress that has been going on for *literally all of human history*.

Nope. In the pretty near future, people will still want stuff. And that stuff will be made with just about zero human labor. In the end there's really no job that a human can do that a robot can't do better, and for free.

Think about the economics of digital media, the way you can currently download a song for free because copying and delivering it costs zero. We're fast entering a world where the same thing are going to happen with physical goods and a services as well. You'll want a new TV. Robots will mine and refine the raw materials, 3D print all the parts from it, assemble it in fully automated factories, and put it on a self driving car to be brought to your front door.

While that vision is still a few decades off, we may have already hit the tipping point in terms of jobs being automated away. And that's only going to get worse from here on out. A basic income is really the only solution to this; we need to decouple survival from being economically productive, because we're getting to the point where it'll just be impossible for most people to add any economic value to anything.

In a fundamental sense I can see why you would say that, but it's a bit of an oversimplification. There were plenty of gradual programming and methodological innovations to go with the hardware improvements. 

&gt;The technology that powers self-driving cars is also not new. In fact, its mostly based around gps.

It depends a little on what you mean by new. Yes, a lot of the technological developments with regards to self-driving cars (and most 'new' technology, really) are new more in the sense of innovative combinations of existing technologies or application of known theory rather than being completely in-a-vaccuum never before seen new. For example, in 2011 when we first started hearing claims that [AI were now better than humans at visually recognising traffic signs](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf), there isn't much there that was ""new"" in the sense you seem to be using it, but AIs are still now better than they were before at a particular task. ""Newness"" of technology isn't necessary. Regardless though, self-driving cars are a good example of how lots of perhaps seemingly narrow capabilities can be combined to produce something that does something more complex. 

&gt; It's just performing a simple, autonomous task better than a human.

Yes, but the number of tasks they can do are increasing and have gotten more complex over time. Are you saying that AI will stop improving at some point in the future?

&gt; AI is artificial, like artificial flavoring. And if you were expecting the real thing, you are ultimately going to end up disappointed.

Second, walking around on two feet requires  A LOT of power. I think almost every video of Atlas you see shows the power cables.

But then you have to worry about C02 poisoning if the robot is indoors. 

And third, you need a lot of software to make it useful in general. Self-driving car like soft AI levels of sophistication would be needed to make a humanoid robot useful at many things. Lucky that seems quite doable.

Today it cost your time (arguably the most valuable thing you have) and your fuel expense + depreciation for owning the car. Tomorrow you will have your time back and fuel costs + depreciation will be split through all the people who use the car in addition to yourself. Lets say that on average a self driving car supports 12 people in a day. Plus Google (taxi service) will have economy of scale (bulk contracts with auto production).

Imagine it's 1890, and someone tells you that the future is going to be radically different, citing recently invented technologies such as the telephone, lightbulb and automobile. Naturally you would be skeptical. After all, if you look around you nothing much seems to have changed in the last 40 odd years you've been around. The primary mode of transport is still the horse and carriage, people still dress the same, you've never used a telephone in your life, and the lightbulb was a cool gimmick you saw at a public demonstration a  couple of years ago. 

But then suddenly things begin to change. Not only do the aforementioned technologies start to become commonplace, but other technologies which you could not have even dreamed of start becoming a reality. The aeroplane is invented, photography becomes widespread, motion pictures start to make an appearance, radio is invented, Ford unveils the Model T. And suddenly, 30 years later, everything has changed. You may not have realized it since to you it would have seemed gradual, but from an outsiders point of view the world is completely different.

I would argue that we're currently in such a period, but you don't yet realize it. Self driving cars will become widespread, and over the coming decades will completely overhaul our infrastructure system. Virtual reality devices such as the Oculus Rift will become so advanced that they will fit into a pair of glasses by 2020, and will probably have amazing augmented reality capabilities too. The line between the real and the virtual world will blend. You'll be able to talk to someone face to face as if you're in the same place, even though you'll be halfway across the world from each other with these devices. Videos and photos will be replaced when we figure out a way to capture the world in 3d and view it through them. Think about that for a second. Videos and photos as we know them today, which have been a staple of the world for over a century, will become obsolete.

3D printers are getting more capable by the year. A group of Stanford graduates a couple of days ago revealed an open source attachment for the Rep Rap that allows it to print electronics. 

People are successfully experimenting with NFC chips inside their bodies, and brain to brain interfaces are pushing forward too. 

Drugs such as Marijuana, LSD and MDMA will probably be legalized in some form too, or in any case will become more accessible. Governments won't be able to stop it.

Now imagine the accumulative effect of all these technologies on the world. None of this is wishful thinking. These are all technologies which exist today, and that only need to be refined further before they become mainstream, which will happen, just as it did with the telephone.
Now, what I'm most excited about is, what will be our generations aeroplane? What is the technology that today seems like a far off dream, but which will come out of nowhere, completely unexpected, in the next few decades? I can't wait to see what it is.

Now imagine this. Imagine you're in the year 2040, where all the things I've mentioned above are commonplace, and then imagine you're back in 1990, a time before even the internet as we know it existed. Still skeptical?

1- Virtual Reality

Failed in the first attempt, due to lack of the necessary elements that would make it viable, such as graphics processing power, low latency tracking, high resolution displays, etc...
Ten years from now, VR will be completely intertwined with our daily lives, for entertainment, communication, work, education...

2- Gene Therapy

Another technology that ""failed"" in the first attempt, due to a few unfortunate deaths which pretty much made the funding for the entire field of research fizzle.    Now that we have better techniques (i.e. CRISPR) and a greater overall understanding of the process, we will likely see a lot of miracles being performed in many until now incurable diseases.

3- Regenerative Medicine

Another area that's gaining more and more traction outside the research labs. I'm extremely confident this another field that will revolutionize medicine in the next 10 to 20 years.  I would be very surprised if we're not able to fully regenerate entire organs in the next 20 years.  Not to mention various types of tissues (skin, ligaments, bones, blood vessels...).


4- 3D Printing

Right now, it's pretty much a hobbyist thing.  But can you imagine when it's faster, and able print objects in multiple materials?  Not to mention all the different types of 3D printing that are being developed, such as bio printers for organs, food printers, etc...  
I can clearly imagine every single household having one or more 3D printers  20 years from now. And we won't remember how we could have ever lived without one.

5- Self Driving Cars

It's been estimated, that by 2035, there will be around 54 million self driving cars being sold (nearly 10% of all sales).  It's hard to see anything more transformative than riding in a car that drives itself.  It's just nuts, right?!


6- Nanorobots

Another slow going technology that's about to start having some real world applications very soon.  Research Ido Bachelet's DNA origami robots, and you'll see that they're about 5 years from being able to start clinical trials for drug delivery/cancer fighting nanorobots.

320,paper_liger,"I'm a libertarian, but I have to honestly admit just judging by the arc technology seems to be taking that there will be  time in the relatively near future where capitalism simply won't work in the way it has. 

A 5 percent unemployment rate used to seem like a natural set point for an industrialized nation. But what happens when disruptive technology comes in and causes structural unemployment? If self driving vehicles come online in 20 years (and it could probably be done in 5 years if people really wanted it) what happens to the 3.5 million truck drivers out there? They'll have to move into other industries but as all technology specializes and branches out there will be fewer and fewer industries where humans can still do it better or are necessary. 

You see this to smaller degrees in fields like graphic design or programming. The bar to entry to  call yourself a ""graphic designer"" is incredibly low compared to the specialized training and equipment required 40 years ago. Programming as well. And now you aren't just competing with the kid down the street with the pirated photoshop, you are competing with people living on the other side of the planet who don't have to pay your relatively high standard of living. 

Again, I believe that capitalism will survive in a form, but that most of humanity won't be participating in what we currently think of as economy. I'm a libertarian, but I can see which way the wind is blowing. We are like hunter gatherers who have pursued a stag to the edge of the forest, and for the first time see a town and farms stretching off into the distance. 

The only way to stop change like this in the long run is to use the kind of heavy handed government intrusion that conservatives are supposed to be against. You'll see truck drivers legislated by law to be present in a cabin despite the truck driving itself. But that's like New Jersey's silly gas attendant laws. It won't work in the long run. 

So yeah, I believe capitalism is the best system at present, but going forward, in a hundred years or more we are going to have to figure out an alternative to everyone working for a living. You can rail against that, and toss around the word ""progress"" likes it's a swear word, but that doesn't change anything.

329,Esoteric_Monk,"Always an interesting question. Keeping away from the tropes of Utopia and Dystopia, assuming there's no collapse of Western society as we know it and America is still strong, I'm thinking things will look pretty darn similar but with some subtle differences.

We'll likely have self-driving cars, so traffic jams are a thing of the past ... or are they? If there are laws passed that make major highways self-driving only, we'll likely see commuter traffic improve. In the cities it might be a longer battle, so we'll have auto and manual side-by-side. The manual cars will be more advanced, though, with safety features that go hand-in-hand with many of the auto's (auto automobiles? Autauts? We'll work on that.).

Wearable tech will be in full swing. Clothing could very well have the ability built in to change color, add designs, etc. Flexible screens are more advanced, with ""smart paper"" making its way into offices and homes. Glasses and contacts will have HUDs. Sensors in shoes for exercise.

We'll be witnessing the rise of biotics. Sight restored. Limbs rebuilt. Spines fortified. All with full range of movement one expects from their fleshy counterparts and with the ability to ""feel"" to boot. The interface between humans and machines vastly improved. Possibly enhancements to the brain, though that one's a tad more complicated. We certainly may see the beginning of elective upgrades for people who want bionics without actually needing them.

We'll be on Mars. Maybe not a colony, but certainly an extended mission. Fusion engines will get us there in 90 days. The space station will be extended, but there will be the burgeoning private sector stations, driven by companies who don't want to be hindered by contracting with NASA to use the ISS. Suborbital flights will allow for travel times to be cut almost 90%. Mining efforts on asteroids will yield materials in orbit to be used for construction, laying the foundations for an orbital space port and shipyard.

Robots! Yes, our old friends the robots. Hand-in-hand with the advancements of biotics, robots now move like people do, at least the ones we want to look like people. The true incursion of robots into our lives will be felt around this time, as they slowly worked their way into almost every facet of our society. Robots of all shapes and sizes. Robots with synthetic ""personalities."" Robots who serve you drinks and serve you medical care. Robots who drive you around (hey, that's those autoautos from before!). Robots who construct buildings. Robots who farm the land and milk the cows. Robots who are your child's best friend (Teddy Ruxpin on steroids).

Along with bionics we'll see the rise of lab grown organs, faster healing times due to printed skin for burn victims and printed casts with ultrasound therapies for broken bones. No more wait times for that new liver; just add stem cells. Artificial blood provides for an unlimited supply for transfusions and since it's all Type O, everyone gets a taste. Face transplants are more common. Plastic surgery can make you look like anyone or anything, kind of. Gender reassignment is almost perfect; vaginas and penises grown to order.

Biological immortality. That's a big one. Bets on all sides and it comes with its own set of problems. Let's say we're there in 50 years. Population control becomes the number one problem to solve. Advances in birth control will help, especially now that we have a solution for men. Laws could be enacted; only one child to a couple every 30 years? Doesn't sound so bad. Space exploration provides the best answer. Now that we're on Mars, sky's the limit.

AI. We're not quite there yet, but dammit if we can't create the illusion of personality. It's only an illusion for now ... right?

This doesn't cover everything. I simply don't have the time. What I end with is the word ""subtle"" again. If you go back 50 years you'd be in the year 1964. The differences you'd spot right off the bat would be the lack of smart phones and the styles of the era. Aside from the smart phones, the differences would begin to be more subtle the closer you got to 2014. Twenty years ago you may be hard pressed to identify when you were just by a glance.

333,brainguy,"Now they need to integrate it with bitcoin micropayment contracts. I wrote this a few months ago when people were posting about self driving cars on facebook.

Concept: Self-Driving Taxi Cabs

So basically the concept is that you can write ownership, or the ability to use property someone else owns, for anything that is cryptographically controlled into the blockchain. One thing that is currently cryptographically controlled is the keys to start a car.

So if you have self driving taxi cabs whose ownership is crypographically controlled by reading the blockchain (presumably owned by a company who owns many taxis) an individual could get into a taxi and enter into bitcoin micropayment contract with the self driving taxi when you tell it where to take you. While the car is then driving your micropayments would be calculated based on things like distance/time (i.e. exactly the same way you would calculate a current metered taxi fare) and once the individual finishes the ride and arrives at their destination they would settle, the fee will be paid, and the two exit the micropayment contract. The advantage of the micropayment contract is it would allow for any number of functionality that human interaction provides in a taxi cab, for example deciding if you want the driver to take the west side high way or not, or changing your mind and getting dropped off somewhere else. You would simply be telling this information to the self driving car rather then the taxi driver.

Additional benefits I've thought of

1) Taxi's could be used in the native language of the user, basically any person can interface with the computer and use something like Google maps to specify a destination in any language with no need to speak the native language of the area

2) No tips",1399477996,chbw80z,t3_24yg6g,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2014
334,neoKushan,"From what you've just stated, I can't think of a single benefit to using crypto payments for this over standard payment methods. If anything, all you've done there is make it far more complicated than it necessarily needs to be.

The self-driving Taxi will operate the same, regardless of how it's paid. Telling it to go via a different route, interfaces with different languages or getting off early doesn't affect that at all, you just pay a different amount. The only thing you seem to have got focussed on is the idea of traditional payments having to be made up front, but that's not much of a deal.

With a credit/debit card, you can pre-authorise a certain amount in advance and then put through the actual amount later. So you can get in the cab, tell it your destination and it'll give you an estimated fare. Pop your card in and it'll pre-auth that but when you get there if it cost less, then it'll just authorise the lesser value. This is nothing new and can be done today.

There really is no need to implement crypto payments for this, other than for the benefits of a crypto currency itself but the same can be said for most services. There's just nothing special about this one that I can see.",1399479401,chbwwbb,t1_chbw80z,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2014

Semi-self-drive/ride vehicles will be more expensive, have higher insurance (still much less than now), probably pay extra taxes, and have to keep a manual drivers license, which would cost more still, and be harder and harder to get/keep as there are fewer and fewer manual drivers and the average manual driver's skill has to come up...eventually our drivers education system might be as good as Germany's is currently, lol.

336,neoKushan,"&gt; This could theoretically become sort of a DAC[1] as ownership of the cars and ability for them to start could literally be entirely controlled via the blockchain.

Again, I don't see the need to involve a crypto's blockchain to do what you're asking. Ownership of the cars can be controlled remotely easily enough, these cars are going to have to be connected to the internet to process crypto payments anyway, so there's nothing stopping them from being remotely disabled, rerouted or whatever. There's no benefit over existing technology in this regard. I think what you're getting at is more for general ownership rather than Taxi's but realistically, what's the difference between having a wallet with you to prove ownership over having your bog-standard electric fob that cars all have these days?

&gt; True, however one of the benefits would be much lower fees for processing the payment which would make the service economically competitive in pricing.

Well as I said, this just a standard benefit of a crypto currency and applies everywhere, but it's not exactly a deal breaker. The autonomous taxi's will be extremely competitive anyway because they don't have drivers. The payment issue isn't that huge, the cost will likely be absorbed and then some due to being driver-less (otherwise, why bother with self-driving taxis at all?). Besides, most Taxi firms (At least in my country) accept card payments already.

I get that crypto currencies are brilliant and all that, I do think there's a lot to them and the future uses are incredible, I just don't see how this specific situation benefits from it any more than any other payment method.",1399480951,chbxnyr,t1_chbxdqb,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2014

339,californiafalcon,"I am estimating a period of 5-10 years for drivereless cars to be implemented on the current Lyft/Uber models. I easily make $300 over a 12 hour period during a weekday ($400 on weekends), and Lyft/Uber will take ~20%. By cutting out the middlemen (drivers), Lyft/Uber can ensure they take ALL of the fare. **Lyft and Uber together and generating more than $1 million in fares daily in Los Angeles alone**. They have every reason to find a way to replace the drivers. This will lead to a surge in funding and developing a driverless network, which is why it will happen faster than anyone is accurately predicting. The ONLY thing that is preventing this from happening immediately is legislation/liability regarding driverless cars, which will certainly be lobbied for in the next 3-5 years.



**What is going to happen once that occurs?**

In the near future, owning a car in Los Angeles will be unnecessary. On-demand ride shares like Lyft, Uber and Sidecar have proven that all social classes, from lawyers to strippers, are willing to pay for point-to-point transportation without the financial burdens of car ownership. With the advent of electric and self driving cars, and the drastic drop in technology production costs, driverless electric cars will create the a transit system of **""private transportation,""** a service providing on-demand, point-to-point car service. For many this will be their sole purpose of transportation, and for others it will be supplementary to public transportation. At this point, why drive?


Modern society is engrained to need instant gratification. Look at how teenagers shop and consume media. If consumers need something, they need it immediately. Even waiting 15 minutes for **anything** may be deemed too long, and current ride share platforms are incapable of accurately guaranteeing a car or pick up time. 


The main problem **in Los Angeles** is an exponential population without a reliable and expansive public transit system. We don't have a wide rail system that spans the entire city. As population increases, more people will be commuting through the city daily, and without a rail system that crosses high employment areas in Mid City, West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, UCLA, Century City, West Los Angeles, Venice, and many others, workers will be forced onto the streets, in overcrowded buses, their own personal car, or bicycles. However, buses are routinely late or broken, bicycling may take too long (amid safety concerns), and owning a car can be too costly.


However, the new trend emerging- using Uber or Lyft as a commuter service- is skyrocketing in popularity. People would rather pay a small amount immediately than to deal with lost time or the stress of driving themselves around. Why are they doing this?


**Benefits as a Passenger**

**YourCar** - *It's your car. Why drive?* (A private transportation concept)

Self-driving cars, networked together to guarantee efficiency and punctuality.

**How YourCar Works**


User requests car via app. Car immediately starts driving to user's GPS location and notifies user of pick up address and estimated time of departure, based on real time traffic information. User can edit pick up location if necessary. User then enters destination address on app. App immediately calculates estimated time of arrival and fare.


Cars are equipped with Wi-Fi and mounted tablet display. The tablet displays map, time, pick up/destination points, and is equipped with front facing camera for conferencing support if necessary. Support visually confirms passenger and destination upon pick up.


Users can request future departure via app. Cars are networked to guarantee availability for future scheduled requests. Algorithms can make sure that cars always pick up the closest passenger (something Lyft and Uber are incapable of because the platform is ""first come, first serve,"" meaning the closest car at that exact time is sent to you, even if an even closer car is available 5 seconds later).

**Overnight**

Cars automatically return to a centralized location between 12midnight at 4am for cleaning, refueling, and maintenance. These locations will be either large parking structures or lots. They will likely include technicians and an automatic car wash.

**Targeted Marketing**

Imagine you're in the car, and there's a Jack in the Box up the street. An offer pops up (""Stop by Jack in the Box and get $5 off this ride!"") then you tap ""Let's eat!"" or ""No thanks."" Also potential to partner with Pandora for music.

**Security**

All cars monitored by live camera system. Cameras record video. There is no audio recording- the tablets' microphone is only activated during a video conference with Support.

**A car driving itself? I don't know...**

They said the same thing about Lyft/Uber when they first came around. (""A stranger driving me? I don't know..."") To get people used to the idea of a car driving them around, there will initially be a remote support concierge using the tablet screen to welcome passengers and confirm destination.


In car screen:

""Welcome, {passenger's name}!""
{Destination address and ETA}

Car-sharing makes economical sense- pay for the car only when you need it, and use the *type* of car you need when you need it.  Each car is actually used instead of being parked 95% of the time.

But car-sharing programs still have one main drawback- you kind of have to get to the lot where the car-share keeps its cars.

361,eobanb,"You're correct about most operating costs being a function of miles driven, of course.

However, the biggest one you listed, depreciation, is not really an 'operating cost', it's the value the car loses over time from its initial true market value, and is only relevant if the vehicle gets re-sold prior to being completely inoperable. That's important because depreciation is [about 50% of the total cost](http://consumerreports.org/cro/2012/12/what-that-car-really-costs-to-own/index.htm) of a car, a cost that gets spread out over many people. Granted, some depreciation is due to use, but mostly it's just time. Even if you bought a brand-new car today and then drove it 0 miles, it would still be worth probably half its original value after five years. In essence this is not far off from what people actually do with their cars that sit for 23 hours a day.

Apart from that, I think you're still forgetting that even most other costs benefit considerably from economies of scale for a fleet. I think it's safe to assume that any autonomous taxi service would be a fleet purchase, another cost advantage for taxis. And not only would the sticker price be lower, the interest paid would be lower too. No taxi service would allow interest to account for 11% of their vehicle costs (again see the Consumer Reports chart I linked above). Unless you have the cash upfront to buy your own autonomous car, another cost advantage for taxis.

Maintenance on a large vehicle fleet is much, much cheaper if they're all the same type of vehicle, since parts, tools, and training only need apply to a single configuration, and a sufficiently large maintenance operation can be set up in-house rather than being contracted out. The US Postal Service does this, for example, with their fleet of 100,000 Grumman LLVs (which are, like a self-driving taxi would be, designed for easy maintenance).

And how about recharging? With thousands of cars to run, no doubt a taxi service would negotiate a bulk electricity rate from the utility company. Present-day transit services lock in low rates on fuel and power, and in cases where both the transit service and electric utility are government-owned (like the NYC Subway and NY Power Authority) the kWh rate is extremely low since it's the government selling power to itself.

This is what I'm thinking about, too. Google would probably shine at coming up with some kind of adaptive routing. You could be on your way from pickup to dropoff and the system gets another request that is 3-4 minutes from your current route, so it swings over to pick this person up. As long as the users of the service understand that the time of the trip can expand slightly due to demand, you can make things more cost effective. Essentially you could turn a fleet of smart cars into a fleet of mini-buses.

Alternatively, you could offer a second-tier direct route option where you will be immediately taken to you destination. But, you'll pay more for this service. Like a cab.

In any case, I can totally see self-driving smart cars and an Uber like service revolutionizing mass transit for smaller cities like mine. Mass transit is underutilized here (for a litany of reasons too long to get into) which results in buses that run at maybe 15-20% capacity during the peak of the day.

394,Orlonde,"The conventional wisdom holds that the displaced folks will eventually move on to other (better?) jobs that end up getting created en masse thanks to new tech. And perhaps that's correct; it's what has always happened in the past, after all. 

But it may well be different this time because so many jobs are becoming amenable to automation rapidly and comprehensively. This might not matter. One might say, for example, that when robots take over job class x or software takes over job class y, then the former holders of those jobs will retrain somehow and get better jobs programming those robots or developing that software.

But how many devs does the world really need? Instagram famously had 13 employees when Facebook bought it for a billion dollars in pretend internet money. 13 employees that managed a service that tens of millions of people used every day. When and if self driving cars and trucks put tens of millions of professional drivers out of work worldwide, are these people really going to be able to get jobs writing software for robots, cars, kiosks, or frivolous apps, or whatever else? What happens when writing software itself becomes highly automated, in the same way that other kinds of knowledge work is now becoming? (Look what's happened to the legal profession in part because of automated document review and automation of other low end tasks.)

Maybe these tens of millions of people will not all need programming jobs. Maybe some other classes of jobs will emerge that we cannot even conceive of right now. Somehow I doubt it.

Ever since I heard about Google's self-driving cars, I've thought about how likely it is that taxis and drivers like us will become a thing of the past. They're already starting to claim a bit more of a cut with this new ""data plan fee"" they started charging drivers this month. Eventually they will take the whole thing, for better or worse.

The only thing I'm not sure of is that it will totally eliminate car ownership/driving. I think it will certainly be reduced, but the nature of cars themselves is changing thanks to Tesla, SmartCar, the Nissan Leaf, etc. As that continues I could still see a fair amount of people wanting to own a personal vehicle for longer, more remote trips or just as sort of a hobby. A decade or two from now this could just be a ""crusty Millennial"" viewpoint, but long-term I'd like to own something like what [Lit Motors](http://litmotors.com/) is working on or whatever low-end options Tesla and the like come out with. 

Relatively soon I think we'll see more people using improved public transit for work and medium-distance transportation, autonomous point-to-point services like Google Uber for short distance, recreational reasons (going to the bar, store, ballgame, etc), and personal vehicles to fill in the gaps or just for enjoyment.

Strong AI will very slowly appear. We'll get tons upon tons of specialized Soft AIs first. Already Facebook's Deep Face is better at face recognition than humans. That's one of those human level intellect things we though we won't see before strong AI. And yet, here we are. 

Self-driving cars are coming. They'll be common. As will be self-flying planes and  helicopters. IBMs Watson will do tons of medical diagnosing, and legal research. Humanoid robots will do a lot of blue collar work. But all of that will happen slowly and without a strong AI. Eventually we'll cross the threshold from a bunch of really great specialized soft AIs, to the first strong IA. But the difference between the two will be tiny.

437,JordanLeDoux,"So many people here missing the point.

**Cost**

Right now, roads cost money to pave and to maintain. Asphalt roads need to be repaved about every 20 years, and concrete about every 50, and that does not take into account environments that might shorten that, such as hurricane prone locations, or places with severe winter weather.

Currently, paving in concrete is more expensive, but lasts longer. Paving is approximately $50,000 per lane mile, but variation in cost of materials, location and other factors can raise that up to as much as $150,000 per lane mile. 

The cost of maintaining the pavement, according the Federal Highway Administration, is approximately $15,000 per lane kilometer per year. This means that the lifetime cost per lane mile of road is approximately $1.25 million.

That means that the cost of these roads only needs to cost less than $1.25 million over 50 years per lane mile to be cheaper than current paving.

**Revenue**

Unlike normal paving, this type of paving generates revenue to offset the initial costs, meaning that while it will certainly require maintenance, it's lifetime cost is likely to *decrease* over time, instead of increasing.

**Multi-modal Solutions**

These roadways function and interact with MULTIPLE infrastructure industries. Yes, we should consider transportation infrastructure costs, however a full implementation would ALSO have huge effects on power generation and distribution infrastructure.

The cost of building and maintaining this infrastructure could potentially be eliminated, allowing the per lane mile cost to be even higher while still being cheaper than current systems. Consider if these solar roads cost twice as much as normal roads, but allowed a city to completely remove electric generation and distribution infrastructure. The costs of building and maintaining that old infrastructure would be available to offset the costs of the road ways.

**New Assets**

A project like this ALSO provides new municipal assets that must be considered in the cost. It creates a new way to distribute fiber, for instance, as well as water treatment.

**New Opportunities**

The road also offers some tools for municipalities that aren't even available at any cost right now, such as programmable, dynamic signaling on the roads, or automatic dissipation of winter conditions. How much are these things worth? How much money do they save? 

It would undoubtedly increase the efficiency of transportation itself, which is hard to measure in increased economic efficiency, but is certainly present. It would also likely result in fewer traffic fatalities and injuries. How does the reduced heathcare costs figure in?

Such a system would also be VERY easy to integrate into new technologies such as self-driving cars. If our roads were paved with these things right now, I imagine we'd have self-driving cars within three years widely available. Municipalities would be easily able to implement regulations on such technologies, creating markings on the roads that are easily readable by self-driving cars to control and direct them around the city.

**Externalities**

Already touched on in the previous section, the externalities of such a project would be enormous. Fully implemented, it would almost completely remove fossil fuels from our energy economy, in both cars and the grid. What are the externalities of that? How does that change the economic cost of pollution in our society?

**In Short...**

If it can track moving objects, static objects shouldn't pose much of a problem. I think it will work ok on road B if it works on road A, because driving is the more or less the same on every road. This assumes the car knows where to go, ofc.

491,Wyvrn,"Yes, I do mean what I say. An autopilot's job is trivial compared to a self-driving car's.

All the pertinent information about an aircraft's environment is easy to collect. Height, velocity, wind speed, heading, orientation, momentum. We have simple sensors for it all.

To deal with weather, we happen to have a sophisticated network of weather and radar tracking stations across the world, all broadcasting the information they collect in standardized formats.

Avoiding other aircraft is easy because all planes are required to carry radio transponders that constantly broadcast their location at all times, and there are strict regulations reserving airspace for different classes of aircraft. That's on top of the fact that the atmosphere is so vastly huge and empty planes hardly even come near each other in the open air.

Driving a car is completely different. The surface of the earth is full of humans, animals, buildings other cars, all packed incredibly close together. All travel must be constrained to one-dimensional paths with error tolerance of just centimeters. These paths are spidery and poorly marked in many places, and can be completely obscured by fog, snow, or rain.

Visibility is often limited to only a few meters by the shape of the land or buildings nearby. You can be passing by other cars at hundreds of kmph only a second after they come into view. If you find yourself on a collision course with something, the options for correcting it are very limited. You can't pass over or under anything, you can only steer left and right, and there are invariably other obstacles to the sides.

The difference in difficulty between a self-driving car and an autopilot is stupidly vast.

497,ZorbaTHut,"These are still pretty easy to solve, honestly. All self-driving cars will have the ability to recover from a situation where the car decides to enter the intersection at the same time as another car does. Namely, it'll stop and wait to see what the car does. Also, in a situation where it waits at an intersection and nobody seems interested in entering the intersection, it will eventually and pseudorandomly decide to take the initiative and enter the intersection.

So, what'll happen is that all four cars will stop, then, most likely, one of them will randomly be the first one to wait out its timer and tentatively inch into the intersection. The other cars will detect this and not move. Once the ""aggressive"" car recognizes that the other cars aren't moving, it will drive through the intersection normally, and then the deadlock is broken.

In the extremely unlikely case where two cars start driving simultaneously, they will both stop, then wait for another random timeout period, at which point the chance of them both attempting simultaneously again is extraordinarily tiny; and the chance of it happening three or four times is astronomically small.

The algorithmic process is called [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff), although that algorithm is designed for situations where literally hundreds of actors are competing for the same slot; it'll tend to go much more quickly when four cars is usually the maximum.

2,Historyguy81,"&gt;What makes you say that?

Because in art and creative things, there is no objective superior, it is all subjective. What one person likes another person despises. I use the example of Metallica vs Adelle. Both are popular music acts, but how many metal-heads will listen to Adelle and how many soccer moms will listen to Metallica? (lots of both sides do, lots of both sides are disgusted by the other side because it is art, it is subjective). 

What I argue here is that Musicbot 9000 may have many popular songs, but Musicbot plays country-western and some people still like Willie Nelson and will go to see the cover-bands for Nelson (Assuming he actually dies). Musicbot 9000 on it's ""Country never dies"" tour will go head to head with Nelson's ""why haven't I died yet?"" tour.

 &gt;Sure, human created art will still have a novelty value, however, those humans may soon be competing against computers who can create original compositions at a much greater speed, and even customize those compositions to the tastes of the listener

This they will, and greater speed doesn't mean greater quality in the eyes of the viewer or ears of the listener. 

Example: I read books by David Webber, the guy is getting older, has a family and puts out maybe 4 or 5 a year. Romance novel writers can put our 4 or 5 a month. Why don't i read the romance stuff? because It's not what I'm into. Speed doesn't mean better. 

Some sci fi writers are far more prolific than webber, but that doesn't mean I will read them. Also means that I won't stop reading Webber. 

&gt;So perhaps post singularity something like 5% of popular music might still be human made, but that alone doesn't solve an employment crisis, especially when this market is already oversaturated and you're suggesting that everyone move to it. 

This oversaturation you are talking about, I don't see it. And I see the market for art INCREASING as this process moves forward for the following reasons. 

1) As robots remove the need for human labor, humans will go to half time jobs. 20 hours a week. This means that they will have MORE time for entertainment activities. This will INCREASE demand for art. 

2) As humans go to half time work, they will have more times for creative indeavors. More garage science, academics,  and invention will happen. More people will investigate things. A guy who loves geology but had to drop out of school to feed his family will find he has time to go up to the foothills to investigate things. He may make some basic discoveries about stuff which he could publish and add to our general knowledge.

Another woman who was really into programming but had to feed her kids with the office job will find that she can spend more time on her software and help usher in the next generation of technology. 

Children who grow up in this world will see more adults doing creative labor rather than subsistence labor and be encouraged to be more creative. Hopefully (fingers crossed) the education environment will shift away from learning how to be an employee and shift into learning how to be creative. more music, art, and science classes will be offered. 

&gt;If only 1% of artists ever 'make it big', and only 10% of the population are artists, what happens when 100% of the population are artists and of the 1% that 'make it big' 

Well they don't have to 'make it big'. They only have to make enough. 

A growing number of Vlogs on youtube are able to sustain people who only get a few hundred thousand hits. Most of these people I watch are probably names that people on reddit may only be vaguely aware of, if at all, yet they bring in enough to survive. 

Even now many musicians can survive doing small venues and never ""make it big"" but still make a living. Imagine expanding that to a world where cost of living is 10% of what it is now. 

Also remember when I am speaking of Artists, i am not limiting the discussion to people who engage in performance arts, visual arts, musical arts, but creative production. Think of the guy on PBS who made furniture in an old shop. Think of people who create things for Renaissance Fairs. Think of people who produce one off goods for online market places. 

Also know that I am talking about Academic creativity. People who write papers on history, political science, economics, language arts (english majors survive somehow... i think), and of course hard sciences requires creative investigation methods. 

With more people not doing 9 to 5 work this means more people can be in the labs or in the field doing stupid research with grants funded by those people who ""hit it big"" because the cost of living will be so low that they can afford ten times the bling with tons of cash left over so some of them will dump them into research grants which due to cost of living reductions, won't have to be that big. 

I know this all seems really optimistic, and the point between here and there has a 95% chance of riots (union truckers won't take self driving big-rigs laying down!) but once we get to the other side, it will be very much like Star Trek where everyone who works usually works because they are working toward a personal project and society conditions people to be project oriented.

There is a 'superior' in an economic sense, though. Imagine a musician that takes in all of everyone's publicly available data, analyses it, and then creates the work of 1,000,000 unique artists from different genres, based on the information it collected about everyone's interests.

Meanwhile, a human artist is producing art in a mostly uniform style at the rate of a single human, and has not done any market research to help them craft a successful product.

Sure, if Nelson is still alive he will still probably have a Job. So will a lot of other popular musicians alive today. What will the rest of us do, though?

You don't read it because its badly written pulp. What if Webber put out 4 or 5 or 500 books a month?

&gt; This oversaturation you are talking about, I don't see it.

As an engineer and musician living in a small music hub, I certainly see it. Are you a great musician? Good luck getting paid in anything but beer and pocket change. If you're really amazing you might be able to start headlining. If you play a show every night, and you don't have a huge band, you might be able to make enough to get by. If your band is the 1 out of 100 or so that gets signed to a label that's doing well or gains notoriety at a festival then you might end up living comfortably.

Meanwhile, all I have to do to get a good job is drop out of school and throw a couple of personal projects on GitHub.

&gt; 1) As robots remove the need for human labor, humans will go to half time jobs. 20 hours a week. This means that they will have MORE time for entertainment activities. This will INCREASE demand for art.

Sure, but will it increase by 1000% or whatever would be required to provide sufficient employment for the whole population, and will that need be met by other humans when they are forced to compete with machines?

&gt; Another woman who was really into programming but had to feed her kids with the office job will find that she can spend more time on her software and help usher in the next generation of technology.

Why wouldn't software development be completely automated?

&gt; A growing number of Vlogs on youtube are able to sustain people who only get a few hundred thousand hits. Most of these people I watch are probably names that people on reddit may only be vaguely aware of, if at all, yet they bring in enough to survive. 

They aren't able to sustain themselves, most likely. 1000 hits on youtube is worth about $1 in ad revenue for the content creator, so a video with 1,000,000 hits is only bringing in about $1000.

&gt; Even now many musicians can survive doing small venues and never ""make it big"" but still make a living. Imagine expanding that to a world where cost of living is 10% of what it is now. 

A very small percentage of musicians are able to do this, and most of them are just scraping by. The vast majority of musicians support themselves primarily through another, soon to be automated, job.

&gt; Also remember when I am speaking of Artists, i am not limiting the discussion to people who engage in performance arts, visual arts, musical arts, but creative production. Think of the guy on PBS who made furniture in an old shop. Think of people who create things for Renaissance Fairs. Think of people who produce one off goods for online market places. 

And also think of how insignificant a chunk of the economy all of those people are. It is so insignificant that the BLS groups it into its 'other' section in its table of employment by major industry sector. 4.2% of the population are employed in the very broad category of ""other"". You are talking about increasing that number 20 fold, after eliminating many of the jobs that fall under ""other"".

&gt; Also know that I am talking about Academic creativity. People who write papers on history, political science, economics, language arts (english majors survive somehow... i think), and of course hard sciences requires creative investigation methods. 

So they might be some of the last people to be replaced by machines... but judgement of academic quality is a lot less subjective than judgement of art.

Why would you think that? As far as I've heard, most of these things have pretty decent safety fallbacks, in the event of failures/errors.

If the auto-pilot computer gets confused or there's an error, it simply slows down and stops, or even pulls off to the side. I see no reason why that isn't an acceptable solution..

Besides, most human drivers SUCK at handling sudden problems on the road, like if their engine locks up, or a tire blows, a good percent of drivers out there end up in an accident that they probably could have avoided, by reacting to the problem in a better way. A self-driving car, in theory, should be able to make a better choice, when something like that happens. Another example: If the roads are icy and the car starts to slide, a human driver can only do so much.. Whereas a self-driving car could have individual control over all 4 wheels, and regain control quicker.

&gt;It also can not compensate for all of the possibilities in the ever changing driving environment.

People will still be shopping in stores but the amount of money gained from storefronts will diminish over time, giving way to stores being converted over time to service venues or just storage facilities used by the companies involved. 

The elements of this form of conscious capital already exists today in our current social networks. Companies like Google and Facebook utilize this early element of the capital in the way information is provided to us, hence why we are more likely to come across materials or information relevant or interesting to us. 

Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality will one day be as mainstream as the cell phone is today and it will be much easier to use and carry around with us. This allows greater quality of experiences with limited resources. However, what will make this ultimately game changing is the introduction of the Full Immersion development. People will be able to experience the sights, sounds, smells, touch, and maybe even taste of the worlds inside their virtual reality headsets/contacts/computer chips. Augmented Reality will serve a purpose as well, as it will provide a detailed interaction with the physical world, giving ourselves autonomy in controlling everything in our real surroundings with ease. 

Transportation will become cheaper once self-driving public vehicles becomes mainstream in modern cities. Delivery careers will even be transplanted by automation as self-driving vehicles reach destinations and small robots will directly deliver the package(s) to the customer's door, sending them a text message as they arrive.

Construction will be much more automated in the future. One architect and one construction supervisor will perform the same amount of work as hundreds of construction works. Robotic engineering techniques when combined with cheaper building materials and reusable blueprints will make new homes of the future much cheaper.

When food is printable, the cost of food plummets, the necessity of producing food by traditional means evaporates, and the majority of food-related effort will go towards using crop as another kind of resource and gaining the resources necessary to power these early forms of the food generators. That being said, the more efficient and effective food generator will be one that uses nanobots that have the capability to rearrange the subatomic particles of any sample compound or element and create and desired result. This form of the food printer will also print every other material product that you could imagine now, and then some.

What comes next is quite simple. Once this aforementioned technology becomes commercially available at a cheap rate, the value of the currency of whatever nation this occurs in will plummet. Once people learn to hack through their technology, the cost of living will become obsolete. Land is the only property to deal with left, and once population levels reach their peak, it won't be too difficult for the valuing of land to shift to a common-interest lower price. 

Products of this future will involve entertainment, technology, programmed experiences, design (clothing, furniture, etc. --&gt;printable at one point, no delivery necessary), live events (including night club attendance, expos, etc.), even toys, and at some point entirely new foods and meals designed from a virtual interface. 

People will be able to consume information at 800 words a minute with ease. Audio and visual stimuli will bombard our senses faster than we can even hope to manage in the way our minds work today. It will be all about how fast and how efficient we can connect with others (not necessarily meaningful in our standards of emotional value today). 

At this point in time, the singularity will be imminent if not already reached. Artificial Singularity Intelligence will provide the necessary technology in order to map the human conscious completely and to upload backup drives of our minds. The human mind will then be programmable into any viable form, give or take. So people will no longer necessarily be human anymore. ",1425609513,cp5v2ta,t1_cp5u80e,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2015

These people can either be sacrificed for the greater good, by removing their jobs (and automizing), the younger generations won't really concentrate on ""ok, I can be a cashier register for the rest of my life"", or we can slow down the transition and wait for 20-50 years until it's feasible to do the automatization.

Governments on the other hand are too slow to help the struggling newly unemployed individuals. Although, they could help them.

Governments also employ a lot of people. Bureaucracy can be removed, automating, but they still decide to employ people. Give them jobs that do not contribute to their personal growth. They do not give the individual anything but money.

What could be done? Fire all those people, automate their job. The cost of automating is severely less (if government is not corrupt) than paying those individuals for the next 30 years, even the cost of maintenance for that system. The profit government has can be given directly to the individuals (distributing it by the amount of years wasted on the job, as it is less likely that someone, who wasted 10-20 years being a bureaucracy chair, can find another job).

38,253Native,"You can't program cars to predict kids/mentally ill people from running into the roads, wild animals jumping into the road from very thick bush, heavy weather such as thick rain, heavy snow, golf ball+ sized hail and that means you can't program a computer to predict what to do or when you start hydroplaning, sliding on ice and taking heavy damage from large hail stones. (Hell, do you honestly want your autonomous car to *SLAM* on the brakes while you're hydroplaning/sliding on the ice? No, you want to let go of thee gas *and* not hit the breaks and ride it out, if you *slam* on the breaks, you'll spin. 

Honestly, people think they can also Drink/Sleep behind the wheel in the autonomous cars and that will be illegal and should remain illegal and why? In case of an emergency strikes and a bunch of autonomous cars spin out on the interstate and you have to take immediate emergency manual control in order to manually drive and avoid the spun out cars before you and you won't be able to do this on a whim if you're asleep/impaired from alcohol/drugs.

Also ***NO*** to the people who think people will stop buying cars and will call ""Autonomous Taxis"" that'll automatically drive from the last location that they self-driving taxi dropped someone off and drives *to you* to pick you up and give a ride to your next location.

*Why?* You'll have people take advantage and order the car to go to some real, real, trashy neighborhood and they'll steal every single part off the autonomous cars, it'll cost the companies countless thousands to millions and bankrupt them.

Also, have you ever seen Public buses, trains and even Subways? Some nasty fucker would probably shit in the taxi, jack off in it, people might even fuck in it, drink, smoke cigarettes, smoke HARD drugs in it and you want to hop in and have it take you to work only to show up smelling like semen, heroin, cigarettes, alcohol and possibly piss/shit? FUCK NO. I'm buying my own ""Autonomous Car"" *Cough* which won't happen in our lifetimes unless we have a breakthrough in quantum computer or artificial intelligence.

Also no, redditors can't use the argument they have before saying ""oh oh but, we have our planes flying around our globe 24/7 on autopilot"". *Uh excuse me*? You do know the Airplanes are regulated by every major government and by aircraft controllers, not only that they are regulated either to fly 300m *AWAY* from each other vertically or 600m *AWAY* from another plane laterally [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_(aeronautics)#Vertical_separation)

So in other words, you need to understand that planes ""fly"" or ""pass"" by another plane on Autopilot (i.e. *autonomous*) mode separated by at least *300 meters* away from each other. So, you if you're old enough to have been on the Interstate there's you can pass by literally hundreds of cars just by driving down 10-25 miles on one of America's Interstate's in a very populous area/through a populous city. 

So *no*,you can't compare cars who drive within a *couple of feet* of each other to planes that have to fly *300-1000 meters* from each other. The two can't be compared so please save yourself from looking ignorant and try to use this argument.

Also there's only a few ways Autonomous cars could **hypothetically** work without there being any ""Fatal' accidents  (Because lets be honest here, these cars will kill people. I'm sorry but one google car isn't a viable test sample that drove in sunny southern states with near zero bad weather compared to 350+ million people with cars in America driving around.) who lets say would hypothetically all be in 250+ autonomous cars, we'll most likely see fatal crashes from malfunctions compared to 1 autonomous car's track record. (i.e More cars on the road, more chances for failure, *fatal* failures.)

Not only that, if we were to ban ALL MANUAL driven cars in the United Stater/*enter your country's name here* and force everyone to only drive Autonomous cars only on your country's roads.

How would you enforce that? 

So yeah, you're never getting most people to give up their cars and put blind faith into a car that hasn't been put through real environments and which plus others believe the processing speed of our best CPU/GPU's aren't even fast enough to handle the chaotic nature of our wild animals, heavy weather, mentally ill people, children AND what if a rabbit/deer hops on the raid while it's raining heavily/snowed last night/getting icey rain then all of a sudden your""Autonomous"" car ***slams*** on the breaks *suddenly* and you hydroplane/slide on the black-ice which causes you to slide off the road and/or slamming into the deer that causes you to get in a *fatal* crash ***WHEN*** if you were driving a manual car, you could have let your foot off the gas, either ride it out and/or *tap* the breaks every few seconds and slowly drive to the side and you would've avoided the deer/animal and instead of getting in a fatal crash all because of your ""hurp durp **100% safe** *AUTONOMOUS*"" car. 


Also all because, don't fucking tell me *literally* 1 google car is a ""good"" sample size for a population of 350+ million people in America, with literally millions of car driving ones at that? Nope.

 Like I said before, you won't see many flaws with a ""sample"" group of 1 google car that's been driven in sunny, southern state weather, far away from the rainy/snowy states compared to a *real* ""sample"" group of millions of hypothetical autonomous cars on the road in America which of course with millions of cars (I'm American so, I'm using America as an example for my post, so if you ain't USAin, then just replace my country with yours. derp), we'll start seeing all of the ""Autonomous"" cars flaws and start seeing various accidents from injuries from tire blowouts and the ""autonomous"" car not knowing what to do and slamming on the breaks either in clear/heavy weather and you slide off the road/into another car/into the barrier while potentially getting into a fatal crash or even crashing from hydroplaning/black-ice/mentally ill pedestrians+children/the autonomous car-to-car wireless autonomous-to-autonomous car avoidance network gets hacked by a malicious user with murderous/""joy riding via computer/internet""/childish script kiddie intent (I'm positive these Autonomous cars will have a wireless network which allows every autonomous car to communicate with each other in order to help decrease the chances of them actually driving/changing lanes/driving ON or OFF the interstate EXIT/ENTER ramps or other freeway enter/exit ramps or other freeway systems), even crashes caused by legitimate computer failure (I've worked in the I.T department for *years* and I've seen computers and systems fail for all kinds of reason due to its complex nature of a computer which causes it to have many points of failure, *including* the human failure factored in when the autonomous car manufacturer employees were installing the system/any of the computers hardware/any of the non-PC controlled mechanical parts like the body, transmission, engine, etc that may/may not have been installed properly either due to the machines on the manufacturing line messed up or the *human* employee who worked on Quality assurance missed something/with Malicious intent allowed something to go through even if it was bad during the last inspection before giving it the ""OKAY"" or the mechanics/Assembly line robots failed to install a part on accident/a human did it with malicious purpose and it causes a fatal accident.

Theres so many points of failure. Do you still think you can get 53+% of the American population to vote YES to ban all Manually driven cars and put all confidence into ""Autonomous"" cars with only a sample size of 1 google car?

***Hell no***. You'll never get 53+ of America to vote for a law like that, at least not for another 50 years. Especially when you have people like me who have ZERO faith in computers (working a decade in I.T. from helpdesk to a director) as I've seen EVERY computer system fail, so it's only a matter of time before the Autonomous car's computer resets on you/someone and gets them into a ***fatal*** car crash. 

Second to last thing, like I said before... Every computer fails either from a software, hardware problems or from human error during the manufacturing process and since I've worked in the Information Technology field, I've seen Computers and entire Servers fail for a thousand different reasons, since computer systems are complex they have multiple points of failure so the same rules will apply to the ""Autonomous"" cars computer fails for the 3 reasons I've mentioned above and these cars would/will cause fatal accidents if Americans *hypothetically* owned and were driven in over a million+ of these driverless cars throughout ALL 50 states and when it happens all consumer confidence will vanish instantly, driverless car companies will get sued for the deaths of family members that died due to a software/hardware failure and may/may not bankrupt said companies, which in turn causes stockholders to all flee and drop their stocks they own for these driverless cars and the driverless car company's worth (including stock price, duh) will plummet as companies go bankrupt from loss of sales from lost consumer confidence, lawsuits to cover the damages due to fatal accidents from a company's car's failing and every investor too scared to invest/buy stock in a driverless car company after major issues arise.

2)  Both cars and payout in event of death would be covered under company insurance policy/manufacturer warranty just like you're covered versus the airbags in your car, which now and then do kill people.

The insurance and liability questions are all very easy.  There are price tags already set on the value of property damage, human injury and human life in the event of incident.  Limits will likely be in the contracts you sign when you buy or install the system.  Of course, if you haven't bought the warranty, your insurance company may have to pay out.  your insurance company will likely ensure you buy the warranty, if not buy it for you outright because it's cheaper for them.

They also don't talk about the fact that if you are a truck driver, or a one of the many other people put out of jobs by self driving cars, you will not be able to afford to purchase goods and services over the internet while you are driven around by the new self driving cars trying to find a job.

I think it is a cultural shift away from cars, with more cost and knowledge associated with maintenance the average American cannot afford. I don't think anyone really cares about the environment, but it is a convenient problem to point to. Maybe self driving cars will revolutionize the way we see owning a mode of transportation, but on a whole the desire for 'walkable' places and built environments is strong.

The initial self-driving cars will not catch on like a wildfire, not unless they're especially cheap and effective.

We've had electric cars and hybrid cars on the market for some years now, yet they aren't everywhere despite actually being reasonably useful. The reason is because of initial cost along with lack of infrastructure to support the cars (charging stations, cheap ways of repairing these complex machines, etc). I don't want to buy an electric car if the only place I can charge it is at home, I need to be able to go out of town with it.

I see it played out like this: Truck drives itself.

A self driving fork-lift type does the loading, and since robots take out most of the human error, no packages will be broken.

74,SplitReality,"&gt; Even operating under the presumption that agriculture, manufacturing and services are the only 3 sectors that a job can ever fall under, you still offer absolutely no evidence that we can automate every single possible thing that humans may want in the future. I have already proven that you cannot predict or even imagine future jobs, yet you demand that automation will handle those as well.

We don't need to automate everything, and we most certainly won't any time soon, but the Great Depression happened with only 25% unemployment. Besides you are now changing your argument. Before you were saying that new jobs would be created to replace the old. Now you are saying that we won't even be losing that many jobs to automation. That is a worthy discussion to have but it hasn't been the one we have been engaged in.

&gt; No it doesn't, your argument is not new, it's been used since the 19th century by the Luddites, hence the term ""Luddite Fallacy"".

You just can't resist the old ""Well it worked out before so it will work now"" argument can you, no matter how much you insist you aren't. The Luddite Fallacy simply doesn't apply and I've shown you multiple reasons why. The most prominent of which is that the marginal cost of products and services for the new technologies is near zero. You totally failed to even acknowledge that point. 

&gt; This is not even remotely true, and suggests that you don't know what the Luddite Fallacy is. Although it brings up an interesting point about computer programming. Today, 12 year olds can create web apps and applications that would have taken thousands of engineering hours 10 years ago.

Can't comment on your first sentence because once again you failed to make a point.  As for the next point, I hope you realize that your observation doesn't apply to everyone. The 12 year olds who are programming are the ones who have the aptitude for it. There are plenty more who don't. You know, all those people in jobs that are likely to be automated.

&gt; You fundamentally don't understand the point. We still have a 5.5% unemployment rate. Technological innovation and automation has been happening for a long time and yet we still have not seen even a shred of evidence of technological unemployment. You keep demanding that this technology is different, today is different, we're doomed, but you have not provided any evidence or sound reasoning for how this would happen and why.

Not a shred of evidence. How about the fact that [real wages have remained stagnant since the 1970s](https://systemicdisorder.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/productivity-chart-1948-2013.png?w=640)? Or how about the fact that the unemployment rate of people who have given up looking or who had to settled for part time [has grown relative to the base unemployment rate](http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/54f9988869bedd306d0b2643-1117-840/screen%20shot%202015-03-06%20at%207.01.58%20am.png). That rate, the U-6, currently sits at 11.0%.  

All of that is consistent with the supply in the workforce increasing relative to the supply of jobs. 

Beside, I am not saying that this problem is critical now. I am saying that it will become a problem in 10-20 years. There is plenty of technology that is coming up that will eliminate millions of jobs like self driving cars, and IBM's Dr. Watson. The funny thing about those technologies is that before they pass the threshold of working they will be relatively invisible. After all nobody wants a driverless car on the road that mostly won't cause an accident. But after the tech become viable it will provide such economic saving that its use will balloon.

When I laugh at your assertion without proof, and compare you to the centuries worth of people arguing the same exact thing, you try to defend it by accusing me of arguing that historical trends never change.

There is a reason why it hasn't happened for the centuries that it has been argued, and it's because economics is driven by people and so it continues, unemployment rates fluctuate by small amounts over the short-term and remain relatively stable over the long-term as GDP and quality of life increase.

The burden of proof is on you, who is coming in and demanding that the entire economy and the basic fundamental properties of economics are about to be completely modified.  Your technology is not special, it increases spending power which goes right back into growing the economy, which grows jobs.  It's cyclical because that is how economies work, it's a feedback loop, and you've done absolutely nothing to demonstrate that the feedback loop is in any inherent danger.

The great depression proves that not all jobs need to be lost to have the effect that I'm describing. That directly contradicts your assertion that I need to explain how **every job** will be eliminated. If you are going on the assumption that *""automation does not cause structural unemployment""* because not every job will be automated then you are clearly wrong about that point.

You obviously don't know what it takes to be a professional website developer. That analogy is like saying anybody that can change a light bulb can be an electrician. You can create a web interface with drag and drop, but to actually get it to do something requires programming. So yea, somebody could create a fan web site for their favorite band but they are not going to be working on Amazon.com with that skill set.

Besides none of this applies to the 30 old truck driver today. Oh, and on top of that higher education is priced out of reach of most people anyways so exactly how would they get the training after they've been put out of work?

Just one more thing...Using technology and creating technology are 2 entirely different things. Turning on a TV and making one are not even remotely similar.

&gt; A problem that has nothing to do with technological unemployment. De-regulations, destruction of collective bargaining, reducing the progressive tax system, ...

I agree that those are a factor but...

Notice how I said the ""unemployment rate of people who have given up looking or who had to settled for part time **has grown relative** to the base unemployment rate"".  See the [difference between U-3 and U-6 per year](http://i.imgur.com/FiCW812.jpg). It's been increasing since around the turn of the century, then shot up during recession. It's recovered a bit since then but is still way higher than pre-recession. That means companies have been permanently laying off some people. It is those people who have inflated the U-6. They are taking part time jobs or dropping out altogether. It is that surplus of workers that is part of the reason real wages haven't improved.

&gt; Detail it, don't just hypothesize there is a problem and then demand everyone else is wrong. I've already proven that it is impossible to accurately model markets, and yet you demand that you can accurately model it to know technological unemployment is a decade or two away. When I laugh at your assertion without proof, and compare you to the centuries worth of people arguing the same exact thing, you try to defend it by accusing me of arguing that historical trends never change.

I just did. But one thing about my argument is that I am saying that we are entering a situation that has never happened before. I have explained why that is the case. I have shown that technology has destroyed employment in sectors of the economy in the past, and that the only reason unemployment did not rise was because a new sector became dominant. We have witnessed this two times in the past, first with agriculture and then with manufacturing. Now we are posed for it to happen a third time with services and you are like Baghdad Bob claiming nothing is going on and to move along. 

The precedent has been set that a sector of the economy can see a huge reduction in employment due to technology. It is now up to you to prove why services won't be like the other two sectors. Why are services immune to technology reducing employment while agriculture and manufacturing were not? 

&gt; There is a reason why it hasn't happened for the centuries that it has been argued, and it's because economics is driven by people and so it continues, unemployment rates fluctuate by small amounts over the short-term and remain relatively stable over the long-term as GDP and quality of life increase.

No, the reason it did not happen is that extra resources in the economy caused an increase in demand in other sectors of the economy which compensated for the decrease demand elsewhere. There are no other parts of the economy left for that to happen in once services sees the exact same effect of technology that hit agriculture and manufacturing. You have not denied that fact. That is why this time is different.

&gt; There has always been and will always be technology coming up that will ""eliminate"" jobs over the long-term.

And they did eliminate those jobs. 

&gt; Self driving cars on the public roads alongside you and I however could be 30-50 years away to even begin to be sold to the public. Urban driving and inclement weather still pose huge problems for the technology.

The people creating SDCs are saying about 5 years and I doubled that to a minimum of 10 years. Nobody is saying it will take longer than that to develop the tech.

If you have a car that can convert itself into a taxi and earn you cash while you don't use it, then chances are that taxi companies as a whole will go the way of the dodo. There will be less number of cars on the road as a whole and less accidents. So less number of automotive industry workers.

84,frozen_in_reddit,"Even before self-driving cars , driver assistance systems reduce crashes by 31%[1] and i think many are already legal, various new public transportation systems like UBER pool, lyft line and bridj might reduce prices and could offer a very attractive alternative to car users - and we know that accidents rates by professional drivers are far lower than normal drivers(maybe by 80%-90%). And just the existence of all those alternatives(at affordable prices) means that even if people don't fully give up on their  cars, they might do so temporary at risky situations like drunk driving,  driving while very tired, etc. 

So it isn't hard to image a decline of at least 50% percent in accidents(if not much more), within 5-10 years.

85,matthra,"Honestly, as a person in the computer science industry, Giving code access to it self isn't the stretch for me, it's already happening to a limited degree. I work with a system that codes it's own data storage and can enhance access to the data based on usage statistics. 

This isn't even a cutting edge system like what the NSA must be using in their data collection. For data sets the size they are working with, they probably employ hundreds of data scientist, who would still be inadequate if the system couldn't self manage to some extent. Once you get to certain extremes in size and complexity, requiring a human to press F5 is undesirable. 

It's analogous to how we get self driving cars, we automate portions, enhancing the human driver, adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance, lane assistance, etc. Eventually the humans role becomes less and less until we are optional. The possibilities are even more striking because for a computer coding is much easier than driving.

87,befuddled3,"Haha thanks! I really do enjoy the topic and thought experiments.

&gt; Sure, the internet is a great learning tool, but I don't see 30-to-40 year-old people with high-school degrees jumping on the internet and retraining into tech jobs.

Their kids will know more about computers by age 8 than they know in the entire lives though.  They also don't have to retrain into tech jobs buThe 30-40 year old laborers will replace the 60-70 year old laborers while the 10-20 year olds will be filling the different low-skill ""tech"" jobs that arise.

&gt;  If you're abstracting away simpler levels of work, then the remaining work is higher-level.

The opposite is usually true.  Let's think about our keyboards for a moment.  The amount of underlying physics and engineering to get a character from your finger to your screen is enormous and yet even a monkey can do it.

Also, take this thought experiment: ""If I dropped you in the forest, how long would it take for you to write an email"".  The answer is likely never, because the amount of abstraction underneath a simple email is so vast that it would take a single person more than a lifetime to recreate.

Our world is inextricably linked together and built upon abstractions.  Everything we do, everything, is built upon an abstraction that was once a game changing technology.  We have jobs where people drive a giant machine to bring us a pizza to our front doors.  Who envisioned that when Ford was creating the assembly line?  These jobs won't last forever, no job will, but unimaginable jobs will appear.  People will always be driven by their own self-interest, and they will do whatever it takes to get what they want within their environment.  If that means waking up with roosters and tending to the farm so that you can ensure your family eats, or waking up at the crack of dawn to paint yourself up and stand still in the middle of a city for hours, people will always find ways to sell their time.

&gt; What I was worried about there ends up being the braking mechanism you mention: decreased participants -&gt; less production -&gt; less automation until more participants enter again.

The braking mechanism for technological adoption is just the fundamental feedback loop of the economy between consumers and producers.  Information is not received in real-time so you naturally get fluctuations in what they call the boom-bust cycle.  A boom cycle can get out of control creating bubbles and when those bubbles eventually pop it can lead to a downward spiraling bust cycle.  The government has a job to not let things get out of control and get back on track by injecting money into the economy by way of stimulus and higher-risk projects that get people back to work.

This alone is not enough to prevent hypothetical loss of low-skill work, but it is slow enough that it gives us time to adapt to it.  And at the end of the day both producers and consumers have the same goal of growth so people will innovate.

And remember there are ramifications for technology across industries, so the AI required for self-driving cars is going to translate into all types of unforeseeable applications, the algorithms and pieces of those breakthroughs will be used in novel ways across industries.  So much so that we really have no idea exactly how it's going to look but we can be comfortable that it is going to continue to progress *with* the people.",1425752523,cp7ewu0,t1_cp7au7a,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2015

The biggest place where they can replace ownership is in a major city, with a strong public transit network, such that you only want the car for last mile transport, or occasional trips out of the city. If a self driving car can carry 10 fairs per hour between the subway station to their home/office on each end during rush hour it can replace many cars and therefor be much cheaper than all those 20+ people having cars of their own. Then you might also rent one for a day for an excursion, but generally take public transport for most of your intra-city travel. Given parking hassle/costs, getting rid of your car when living in a major city will be quite nice for many people.

But that model doesn't really work out in the country, or for someone who has a long commute. To provide reasonable service for those use cases will require a much higher ratio of cars per person, the cost of the cars will be spread over far fewer people, and therefor the cost per person will be much higher.

100,SplitReality,"&gt; You don't have a novel argument. You offer absolutely nothing beyond what people have argued for 2 centuries.

Stop. Just stop. Put forward arguments. I will no longer reply to pleading to the past. I have stated many times why they don't apply. Direct any comments there.

&gt; You missed the very clear point about layers of abstraction...

What you seem to miss is the fact that if a job becomes that easy, then it is better to just do it yourself rather than to get someone else to do it. For example an ATM is far more convenient and easy to use that to go to a back teller. Voice recognition or apps will make placing orders through of kiosk or mobile app far easier and more responsive than talking to a fast food cashier in person.

Web development through drag and drop will reduce web development jobs since fewer people will need them (hey why would that 12 year old prodigy hire someone to drag and drop) and suppress wages to menial levels since everybody can do it. 

Another thing you miss about your layers of abstraction is that everything above the final layer is one of those jobs that has zero marginal costs. Therefore it won't employ very many people. A small number of people can provide that capability to the entire world.

&gt; Let's see, we have social services and we have the internet with a ton of free resources and we have a shit ton of low to moderate skill jobs. But yeah, I guess you need a $100k education to do anything outside of driving a truck.

And all of those lower skilled jobs are the very ones that are likely to get automated. When you talked about new jobs being created I presumed you meant jobs that wouldn't get automated themselves or else what is the point.

&gt; Thanks Einstein, but every single human being alive today uses a lot of technology to do anything, including making any new technology. It's almost as if you have no idea how anything works.

That has nothing to do with creating that technology. It's almost as if you think restating the same flawed argument over again gives it more weight.

In fact there is a school of thought that says that the increased use of technology is making people more ignorant of how it works. Technology has hidden so much of its inner workings through easier interfaces than nobody bothers to learn how it works. Contrary to your belief, a 12 year old knowing how to text chat with his friends on a smart phone does nothing to help him be an engineer that could create that smartphone. 

&gt; Sure if you just want to nitpick an arbitrary timeline you can show anything with short-term trends. Fact of the matter is, the long-term change has not been anywhere near significant and the delta itself is still trending down since the peak of the recession. But sure, try to abuse statistics to say anything you want even when the numbers clearly don't help you.

Ahh... so now you are just going to ignore data. Interesting debating choice. Does that usually work out for you?

My data wasn't arbitrary. I picked all data that was available from the source I found. And what are you complaining about long term change not showing the trend. I went back over 20 years ago to 1994. If you want me to say that technology didn't have much of an impact before then...OK sure. Take you victories where you can find them. I've always said that this is a growing trend and that it didn't apply to the distant past.

Perhaps [this graph](http://i.imgur.com/1JmBKkt.jpg) will help you spot the trend better. I've isolated underemployed since its values were getting masked by being added to the traditional U-3 unemployment values. As you can see underemployment has traditionally been lower than employment. If the current environment was like the past, then the underemployment value should be much lower. 

What that graph is showing is that the Great Recession exposed a persistent underemployed class that is resistant to improvements in the economy. Business laid off these people to save money and then found no reason to hire them back even as the economy improved.

&gt; Saying this makes absolutely no sense, once again, the economy does not run on ""sectors"", it runs on the totality of the system. It doesn't matter if you break it up into 3 sectors and see a huge shift in employment between them. Your argument fundamentally has to do with there not being enough TOTAL jobs, which makes absolutely no sense and you are doing a piss poor job of arguing it.

You must be actively trying not to understand. I didn't make up that division. That has been the traditional way that we have described the advancement of technology into the workforce. Taken together agriculture, manufacturing, and services pretty much describes our entire economy. And the shift in jobs has been one-way. Agriculture and manufacturing aren't going to start employing more people. In fact they will continue to employ less. So this has nothing to do with moving jobs around the economy. 

Services is the only thing left and that is where major employment would have to come from if you were correct. Yet services are precisely where automation is about to hit big next. Transportation is a huge part of the economy that is being targeted by self driving vehicles. Finance and accounting are being done by algorithms. Computers are gaining the ability to speak, understand speech, and process unstructured data. All that is going to eliminate a whole host of jobs that sit between the interface of humans and computers, and will expand the reach of those computers. Call centers, cashiers, data entry, secretaries...will all go away or be severely reduced.  

This trend is not new. It has happened twice before once technology became good enough to affect a sector of the economy. Yet you continue to proclaim that ""This Time Will Be Different"". You can't say how, or why it will be different, but by God it will be different. Why should anyone believe you?

  - felt the moving privacy of cars

Sharing ressources:

  Similar things happened with computers before. They were allocated once and would wait
  idle if the programmer didn't have to use it anymore. Then time share / multi user happened. Now a single computer can be used by many persons.

  S-D cars might fuel new desire in the shared commodity. Cars will 'regress' to rented charriots.

The car industry really isn't interested in fully self driving cars, because there's a high chance it will greatly harm their business. Google is and is building such cars , and probably without google's pressure the car industry wouldn't have invested nothing at all at fully self driving cars and would have stuck with driver assistance(and mostly for rich people). So Google does deserve a lot of the credit here..

Also car companies aim toward more affordable tech because they want to sell cars. Google aim at what works best and fastest , because they aim to be a part of the transport service business(for everyone) and such prices can work there.

As for how to bring internet to rural africa - while there are cellular companies there , and maybe there are cheap enough basestations at the rural level , i would imagine the backhaul(connection from the basestation to the internet) for internet services would be expensive and also lte basestations and that's why we don't see the rural poor enjoying  decent wireless internet at decent prices - there's always the talk for subsidzing facebook etc.  Anyway , inthis case the proof is in the pudding - the fact that the wireless carrier work with google does imply that google offers a decent cost advantage. And we'll see if this increase wireless usage. 

As for the regulatory/demand issue - google did calculate that if they've managed to get just 5%(250 million) of of the target market at $5 per head per month, that's a $12 billion revenue.

If someone pays $150 / year insurance and on average they payout $125, then when the average payout drops to $30/year they will be forced to drop their premium to somewhere between $35-45. That's hugely a guesstimate, so I'd be interested in hearing someone more invested in insurance tell me how premiums are calculated, but I'm guessing this is close to the mark.

So the numbers are more closely tied, but you can't stay competitive as an insurance company and keep a massive profit margin - someone else will just come in and charge less.

With those numbers, my example for a non self-driving car becomes $150/yr premiums and $102 paid out a year in insurance, $37.50 for running the business (overhead), $3 for taxes.

For a self-driving car with the same model (and my guestimate of $30/yr payouts), the yearly premiums become $44 (upper end of my earlier guess) with a 5% profit margin.  ",1425941662,cp9mz6x,t1_cp9gesy,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2015
123,BiologyIsHot,"Huge of Melbourne are incredibly low-density and built around cars. The average population density of Melbourne is about 1/2 that of Los Angeles which is very sprawly. Melbourne is a little more distinctly centralized than LA, especially when it comes to workplaces it seems, but it's not what I had in mind when I said a ""large city.""

The [city of melbourne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Melbourne) has a low-mid population density of around 2,500/km^2. That's like 1/4-1/6 of the density of neighborhoods with good public transit in the U.S in Chicago, Boston, NYC, D.C. etc. Neglect, underfunding and political biases against public transit contribute to the issues you mentioned above, as well.

A lower-mid density city is obviously limited in how much public transit can be an answer to transportation issues. It's very heavily linked to density and migration patterns within a city. Low density cities tend to be more friendly to cars and develop migration patterns that reflect this, causing more issues for public transit. Busses, trains, etc. are not going to be an answer for a city like Melbourne, obviously. Self driving cars could greatly improve it, although they aren't going to solve all of the issues that decades driving culture has brought on in low-mid density cities, like unwalkable neighborhood design decisions and sprawl that makes even simple trips require a vehicle.

Good public transit is rarely horribly gross, or socially noxious (what is this to mean? are implying you're disgusted by merely by rough physical proximity to your fellow human beings who show differenced from you?).

Good public transit design is definitely not personally inconvenient (especially given that one of the tenets of an effective public transit system is neighborhood walkability--something that car-centric neighborhoods tend to eschew). A major factor that drives people to take public transit in areas with good systems is actually the convenience that goes along with it. If you'd ever actually taken a nice system on a day-to-day basis you'd realize it can actually feel a lot more convenient.

Obviously public transit is not optimized around low-density areas, but we are talking about apples and oranges in that regard. This post was more about issues relating to car culture in general. Cars have created certain cultural phenomena that restrict some different lifestyle choices. In car-centric cities you see design decisions made around cars rather than people that make it feel threatening to walk in certain areas. Streets with large numbers of lanes and no cross-walks/walk lights, lack of sidewalks on some side streets, sometimes you even get physical barriers put in the way of certain trips that could be made by foot instead. There are tons of examples of local neighborhoods where there's a nearby shopping center which everybody has to drive to because 1) there's a high-lane highway in front of the entrance without appropriate crosswalks and 2) the streets will be setup so that if you want to either walk or drive, you can't simply take a short path to the center, and instead the only non-blocked path is a 1-2 mile detour ultimately leading to said big-ass road. I can find some picture examples, but one common way this is done is a row of homes immediately touching a shopping center with no public roads/paths/sidewalks leading directly through this row of houses to the shopping center. Instead everyone exits through various side streets and has to take a longer path another way. There tends to be little or no mixed-use space where people can live, shop, eat out, go out for fun, etc. in the same area. Public transportation development needs to happen in concerts with deign decisions that avoid this and incorporate walkability or it does not count as good public transit.

The point of the article is that self-driving cars won't fix these design decisions and will probably to continue encouraging them.

Moreover, have you stopped to consider that the most substantial change that could come about from self-driving cars is probably the extinction of personal transit? Most people have talked about how self-driving cars wouldn't need to be owned. You could just call a car to where you are and have it take you there. Fewer people would own cars and there would be more ride sharing. It would look fundamentally similar to driving today as far as it probably affects growth and design decisions, though. However, it would probably share a decent bit in common with the things you mention hating in public transit.

If, for some reason, we still mostly own our cars, then the world will look fundamentally the same as it does now, but with fewer traffic accidents. In that case, this article is even more true and we will keep all of the issues associated with cars and car-centric cities, the pollution, the crappy neighborhood design where every trips requires a vehicle, the congestion, etc.",1425946086,cp9pk4t,t1_cp98qd8,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2015
124,BiologyIsHot,"1) It's going to be cheaper. 2) The whole point of this article is more about the design issues that we've made in response to a culture which is car-centric. Lack of walkability--towns and cities where every single trip, even ones that could easily be walked in about the same time it takes to drive require a vehicle because there are physical impediments to getting around by foot and a lack of consideration for that. Energy waste, pollution, etc. Self-driving busses are obviously a better solution to that, but they're also a solution that is only going to be feasible in larger, dense urban areas unless we reverse some zoning and design policies that we've followed for the past several decades. Even most single-family home suburbs could be made more walkable while still using cars and without increasing density, we've just chose not to because often it provides a slight inconvenience to drivers. People who might want to walk around the mile or so radius around their home ignored in this situation though, because why walk 4 blocks when we can just build a nice 4-lane highway without expensive cross-walks to get you there in about the same time without forcing you to move much?

I think the article really misses how engrained differences in design decisions are between public transit friendly cities and car-centric really are. Self-driving anything isn't enough to simply tack a public transit system on a town that has developed in a way that renders it inefficient. It's one of the reasons most mid-sized cities and suburbs have shitty transit that only poor people take. If you tack the system on it just doesn't fit. You have to make long-term decisions that tends to clash with NIMBY attitudes and how people's conceptions of spaces have changed due to cars.",1425946692,cp9px4d,t1_cp972iv,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2015

What percentage of the world's public transit systems would you qualify as ""good""? It's easy to say, well no, my ideal system has all the good bits with none of the bad if three times out of five your system doesn't actually work or is too expensive, politically unprofitable or geographically impractical to implement. 

[...] or socially noxious (what is this to mean? are implying you're disgusted by merely by rough physical proximity to your fellow human beings who show differenced from you?).

That's exactly what I mean. Public transportation forces people that would never otherwise interact with each other into closer physical proximity than they'd prefer, simply because they have no other choice. 

I hate having weird, fat or smelly people sit next to me. I hate sitting in a crowded train and only being able to look out the window or down or pretending to unfocus my vision so that I appear to be in deep thought because it would be impolite to look too long at the weirdos and interesting/attractive people. I hate the lack of privacy. I could go on. 

&gt;Public transportation development needs to happen in concerts with deign decisions that avoid this and incorporate walkability or it does not count as good public transit.

Personally I consider walking more of a hobby, not a viable means of transportation. The fact that I need to walk to and from train stations to my actual destination is something I'd do away with. 

&gt;Moreover, have you stopped to consider that the most substantial change that could come about from self-driving cars is probably the extinction of personal transit?

So far in my life the best experience I've had with transportation has been through Uber. If it was cheap enough I would use it for everything but only if I could continue to have a car to myself for the ride; you are right in that I find ""ride-sharing"" unacceptable. I'm not one of those people that like driving, I just enjoy the freedom and convenience. Self-driving cars have all of the benefits with fewer drawbacks.

I start work at 6:45 AM; if I could get out of bed at 5:30, jump in a car and sleep on my way to work and have a drink and relax on the ride home I'd definitely live in a cool spot like that instead of taking the train to the city anyway because parking is 30-50 dollars per day and having to live close by to make the whole experience less painful.

128,BiologyIsHot,"So I mentioned these because I myself have lived car-free for the past 6 years. Those are the two biggest ""but how do you xyz?"" questions I get regarding not having a personal vehicle. They're clearly two things people are concerned about being able to do with their cars. This comes up repeatedly whenever I see people post online about not driving as well...but how do you do groceries or get furniture (not that I know anyone who really picks up their own furniture these days anyways).

You can already get these things delivered without self-driving cars. It is dirt cheap, in my city you can have groceries delivered every week for 23 cents a day. The prices of the actual items are identical to what they'd be in the average grocery store and the quality is identical. Most people still don't do that... Perhaps they just want to select stuff for themselves in person. Shopping for food isn't the same as shopping for games or technology online, it seems.

&gt;crafted with 3d printers
I'm willing to be self-driving cars will be here before we have 3D printers in people's homes putting together furniture or food products that people actually want to eat. The only slightly-appetizing food 3D printer thus far still needs to you have actual groceries...real tomatoes, flour, etc. They don't produce it from energy like replicators in Star Trek.

To you point about rideshares. 1) It is brought up in 90% of posts about self-driving cars. How Uber's self driving cars will eliminate millions of jobs in transportation, etc. etc. You can hardly discuss self driving cars or automation without it coming up. On top of this, I would counter that the incentive for self-driving vehicles goes down substantially decreased without ridesharing. The only advantages will be less risk in driving and that you can do read or do something slightly more productive while commuting. These are certainly a great things, but it also means that self-driving cars are drastically overhyped as a future technology. It would not be the dramatic economic restructuring everyone has been talking about.

You can already buy some very cheap vehicles that are not self-driving. A self driving vehicle could cut this space down slightly further, but not that much, tbh. Self driving vehicles are not going to change people's personal vehicle preferences.

Also, ridesharing doesn't mean you ride *with* other people. It's the same idea as taking an Uber, Lyft, Taxi, etc. You can ride alone, only it becomes much cheaper for both the company an d the customer without any human labor being required.

TL;DR: Above all I think the really damning thing about your pod-car theory is that cheap, tiny compact cars already exist independent of self-drivers. They are just not popular. Why do you think people's expectations of their needs and what they want will change dramatically if they aren't going to be using more delivery/rideshare programs to commute and obtain goods?

130,AlanUsingReddit,"I had some thoughts along a similar line of logic that I had thought about posting, so I'll cover a little bit of it right here.

Economic efficiency would best be measured in real GDP per capita. Even that doesn't perfectly capture the entire picture, but nothing will. The story that economists have told themselves is that this improves monotonically over time. At least it has since the industrial revolution started.

Today, we are seeing a tapering off in this metric. In spite of all the headlines you read in this sub and similar news sources, our own lives seem to be making progress forward at a rate lower than in the past, or at least compared to the bulk of the post-WWII times. This is reflected in the changes in technology we can identify. Up until 2000 things were changing very fundamentally. But the bread and butter of PCs were pretty well established by that point.

But we still have economic growth. This isn't due to advancing the bleeding edge. It is due to bringing more people into the fray through globalization.

In fact, I think this is a problem for the people predicting an AI tripwire point. In order to hit the true ""technological singularity"", we expect an accelerating exponential curve, and then a sudden upward turn. If we don't see that precursor acceleration, then we must question the future tripwire as well. My argument is that we're not seeing that precursor acceleration. I expect some counter-arguments that I'm looking in the wrong place. I will counter that economic output is the *only* measure that has *ever* been valid to asses technological capability. Problem-solving capability doesn't matter if the problem that you can solve doesn't exist. I make the same argument for AI. If something *claims* to be ASI but can't put that intelligence to work producing something, then we might just label it as a braggart.

I think self-driving cars have more potential than any new technology we've seen for the last 40 years, at minimum. It's hard to understate just how epic this can be. Computers are not useful until they are connected to something, but our cloud computing is relatively quickly reaching the point where it can naturally manage very large real systems. That would be enormous. But I won't accept it until it is truly borne out in consumer price indices.

131,BiologyIsHot,"Scarcity has a specific economic meaning. It doesn't mean only needs, whether you are choosing to use it as such or not. Such a definition isn't as viable as you might think, and I will  explain how further down.

Important to this topic is that we do not necessarily meet 100% of everyone's needs before we meet our own more unnecessary wants. It's hard to use the meaning of scarcity as we currently do without being able to extrapolate it up. Just because it seems ridiculous now does not mean it would later.

I used a planet as an obvious extreme example to highlight a point. That extreme example could just as easily be a personal spaceship or a ""better"" self driving car. Or a ""better"" set of the basic necessities. Even when we can offer everyone everything they need, people will probably always look for ways to offer higher quality sets of the basic necessities. There will be an economy around this and it will feel natural and to an extent necessary to people a much as owning a computer, car, access to CT scans and chemotherapy, if we get sick, feel to us today. Three-hundred years ago (or even one-hundred or two-hundred) the notion of all of these things, or the notion that we should all have easy access to meat if we wanted to eat it regularly, was not a concept people had. Go back far enough and meat was more of a luxury. It was a necessity in that you ""needed"" to get some of it every now and then. Nowadays refrigeration technology has allowed us to efficiently and regularly bring meat to very huge swaths of the human population. The idea of being able to have it less regularly or have it regularly at great cost (several hours of labor hunting a day) would seem overly harsh and restrictive.

Our very view of what we need and how we behave changes in response to efficiency in our economy and technology. Again, computers are probably actually a great example of that. Today they are essentially a necessity to function properly in developed countries. This is why post-scarcity doesn't really make sense when you actually think about it critically.

143,cr0ft,"First of all, I assume you're in America. 

The reason I assume that is because America's infrastructure is a festering pile of garbage, and getting more so by the minute. 

The potholes-o-death that you're seeing now are just part of a much bigger problem where the nation cheerfully blows $1.5 *trillion* a year on the war machine, but spends minimally on maintaining infrastructure. Major pothole issues simply don't happen as long as roads are properly preventatively maintained. 

http://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/ lays it out and gives the US a D+. 

A fun fact; at least 70000 (seventy thousand) bridges in the US are structurally deficient. Several have already fallen into the rivers they cross taking cars and people with them. 

Add to that, the Highway Trust Fund is insolvent. This is where the vast majority of road maintenance is paid from, and the reason it's insolvent is because the completely gutless politicians refuse to raise the gas tax, and haven't since the 1990's. The gas tax is the only thing funding the fund. 

http://blogs.asce.org/highway-trust-fund-runs-dry-this-fall/

There was an emergency measure to sort-of fund it until the fall, it almost went entirely dry already.  

So the reason things are ugly now isn't lack of technology, it's lack of sanity and lack of funding and lack of building roads appropriately. Especially in the south, in areas that have seen real winters for a few years running now thanks to climate change, roads aren't built with freezing in mind, and that's now coming back to haunt the states in question.

People are literally dying because of potholes now, especially motorcycle riders are at huge risk. 

And finally of course, we already have the technology to deal with pot holes. 

It's called ""elevated maglev guideway-based PRT systems"", like http://www.skytran.us - no physical contact means there is almost no wear and tear on the surface of the guideway. Automating rail-based vehicles is also child's play, and they're almost impervious to weather in general, as opposed to self-driving cars on stupid old rubber tires on pavement.

Cars and trucks are bullshit. Building maglev rail - either very-light-weight like Skytran or full size as in conventional maglev trains - would make things hugely faster, much more efficient, way way safer and clean. No more belching diesel fumes into the atmosphere the way the millions of trucks do today. 

TL/DR: potholes are a financial and political issue, and cars and trucks are garbage tech from the stone ages we have to replace with maglev now. Instead of keeping age-old bad ways like roads we sidestep the problem and build something hugely more inherently durable.",1426056897,cpb7cv2,t3_2ylz40,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2015

Proof? To me, this is just an unrealistic assumption. A lot of people drive vehicles that can carry 5-7 people, but they carry only themselves a majority of the time. American culture and residential design patterns are imbued throughout with the tenet of ""exclusively personal automobile use."" Also, car companies will strive to continue their profit-making model, which is to ensure that everybody purchases his/her own car, so you have a massive profit-focused economic force that is inherently aligned against your idealistic idea of car-sharing.

170,fricken,"Amongst tech and auto industry experts the wisdom of the crowd is speculating that the first mass production fully autonomous vehicles will start rolling out around 2020.

This isn't just talk, though- pretty much every big car company and several usual suspects in silicon valley are aggressively developing fully autonomous vehicles. They all understand that the incentives are massive and failure to participate probably means their company won't still be around in 2030. The writing is on the wall.

With autonomous taxis it's not like you need to wait for your conventional car to reach the end of it's lifespan before you switch over to this new mobility option. Much the way you didn't wait for your landline telephone to wear out before switching to a smartphone. Unlike with private vehicles there's no big barrier to entry- it's 5 bucks here, 10 bucks there, no need to take out a loan or deal with insurance and licensing. 

With such low barriers to adoption there's no reason to believe it won't happen pretty quick. The iphone hit the stores in 2007, by 2010 smartphones were virtually ubiquitous. It took 3 years.

When incentives are sufficient, both for industry and consumers, things can change fast.

Of course this is all dependent on how well SDCs work- at the moment there are still many kinks to sort out. Given the law of accelerating returns, though, my guess is that while they may be of limited function in 2020, by 2025 and with the benefit of consumerization to drive development Self driving cars will be magical, and cheaper than taking the bus.

Google is only about 4 years in to serious development on SDCs, and they've come a long way. 2025 is still a decade out.

173,ctphillips,"Believe me, I feel more or less the same way.  The thought of being able to completely relax and enjoy oneself in a private, self-driving car sounds fantastic.  However, after I thought about it reasonably I realized a few things: 

* Once the plans become cheap enough, people aren't likely to buy expensive cars for themselves if they can pay a monthly fee for x number of miles traveled.
* These ride services will likely be owned and controlled by a small number of competing companies.  Those companies will be the primary purchaser of cars.
* Car manufacturers will cater their models to the primary purchasers who will be using the vehicles for very high-mileage applications and the cars will be used by many customers each day.  These are fleet vehicles.  Bye-bye comfort.
* The cars will be easy to clean (not soft and comfy), used by lots of people every day (potentially filthy) and get way more mileage than the average vehicle (worn out).  Think NYC taxi cab.
* In order to stay competitive and keep prices low, these competing car companies will offer ride-sharing plans to customers who need cheaper monthly plans.  So, you will very likely be sharing your car (and quite possibly a van or bus for regular morning commutes) with anywhere from 1 to 3 to dozens of people.  Sure, you might get a car to yourself once in a while, but it'll be for a very short segment of your travel and almost never a full trip. 
* Some people will be able to afford ""private"" plans that ensure they don't have to share rides with strangers, but this will be a small portion of the customer base and these people will very likely have to ride in the same dirty, uncomfortable cars as everyone else.  They'll just do it alone.
* Some people will try to buy cars for their own private use, but parking fees, upkeep and insurance will drive all but the most wealthy customers out of the market.
* Eventually, only small boutique companies or tiny subsidiaries of larger companies will offer private cars for sale to the most wealthy customers.  They will be outrageously expensive and have extreme luxury features.  Everyone else will get fleet vehicles or nothing.

TL;DR - Capitalist forces will drive transportation to a quiet and environmentally clean, but cramped and uncomfortable future.

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/how-self-driving-cars-will-ease-traffic-congestion/article15876882/

I obviously can't prove a prediction, but I can tell you that car sharing is already taking off with companies like Zipcar doing very well.  These companies are doing well even though you need to go to the location where they are parked and return them there.  With automated cars you could use an app to have one pull up in front of your house, take you where you want to go and drop you off.  Do the same for the return.  This is technology that will completely overhaul how we travel.  You talk about isolation.  This tech can pick up your deaf and blind grandma.  

I think you have this all wrong.  Automated cars work perfectly in the world we have created.  The only question people have to ask themselves is ""What do they do with the carport?""",1426282902,cpe3emx,t1_cpdpi9b,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2015
175,ctphillips,"I could keep riffing on these ideas for days.  In regards to the parking fees I mentioned earlier: Huge swaths of parking lots are likely to get re-claimed by real estate developers as self-driving cars become the norm.  The few parking spots that remain will become VERY expensive to private drivers because the vast majority of remaining cars will almost never stop moving, unless they're being repaired or cleaned. 

I think a morning commute for most suburban folks will look something like this: 

* Step outside your house and find an iCar either waiting to pick you up immediately or in less than 5 minutes.
* The iCar will take you to a bus stop (probably near an interstate) where you will get into a van or bus with many other people.  The bus will start rolling as soon as it has all passengers on board.  It won't stop moving until you get near your destination.
* When the bus stops you'll be transferred to another iCar to take you to your final destination or you'll walk.  Again, the iCar will be ready for you immediately or in less than 5 minutes.

So you end up with a commute that's only slightly longer than driving yourself directly.  As tele-commuting becomes more common and as unemployment increases, traditional commutes will become more rare.

Another thought, technology-driven unemployment will go up, probably vastly.  That's another reason we're certain to see automated ride services go as cheap (dirty and crowded) as possible.",1426283635,cpe3t2y,t1_cpe2u48,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2015

Self-driving taxis by maybe 2030. These will likely function more as an extension of public transit, rather than replacing buses or car ownership.

Large vehicles (trucks, buses) could take much longer to automate, because of the need to anticipate (fast reflexes are no substitute with that kind of momentum), and because insurance companies will be cautious.

The majority of new cars sold in the 2030s could be be hybrid or electric, and could reach 50% by 2050. Faster adoption would require a major, major breakthrough in battery technology.

Airships could be for cargo, mining surveys, and various other uses in areas without good roads. They need much less energy than other aircraft, so could probably be electric.

The problem is, self-driving cars will have radio transponders and the networking capacity and computational power to take advantage of it, while humans will not. So self-driving cars will be able join together in smart convoys that can safely drive at 100+ miles an hour, remaining at the precise speed and distance from one another that is required for the first car in the convoy to brake should a child or other unexpected obstacle run into the middle of the street.

Can a human maintain control of a car going 200mph? In a future of transportation designed around self-driving cars, it will be unsafe and undesirable to drive yourself. The examples you used could be talking about riding a horse. What if you're in the mountains and your normal car runs out of gas or has a mechanical failure? A horse would never have a mechanical failure but you aren't complaining about the lack of freedom to ride a horse for transportation There are already a million XYZ sensors on your car that will shut it down if something fails. Hell, the battery in your key FOB could be running low and your car security system won't even let you start the car.

If such a change were to occur, it certainly wouldn't happen overnight. Stop signs, stop lights and speed limit signs would still be in place, why would you remove them unless you were hell-bent on making manual driving illegal?

Answer: you wouldn't. If anything they'd be simply tied into the self driving car network. Pedestrians would also still require walk/don't walk lights to cross the street safely.  There's simply no reason to not have lights and such.


&gt;when you have an 8 lane highway that dynamically changes...how can a driver deal with that

Answer: they can, and do. In major cities like San Francisco this is already becoming the norm. Lanes are dynamically allocated based on the time of day to give more lanes to traffic going into the city in the morning, with the reverse happening in the evening. This is indicated with simple electronic lights above the lanes. Of course it took some getting used to, but it seems to work quite well.

As Musk pointed out at current production levels it would take 20 years to replace all cars with self driving cars. This is assuming all manufacturers immediately started producing only self driving cars. 

The reality is it's going to take longer than 20 years as someone has to make a self driving car that works and prove it. Proving it will take at least a few years to get through most hurdles and then you have to either release your technology to every other car manufacturer or wait for each manufacturer to create their own version and pass all the regulatory tests themselves.

Even once you've made a working self driving car most manufacturers aren't going to immediately stop making drivable cars. A fully self driving car future is still a long way away.

The human, they’re not going to pay attention in the car. You’re going to be on your cell phone, you’re going to totally tune out, whatever.

Plenty of emergency situations give you about 1-2 seconds to respond before an imminent crash, and I'm not going to be able to get out of la-la land fast enough to respond to that. 

Even if the car is doing just 90% of the work, all but the most disciplined humans will tune out and stop paying attention to what they're doing, making them unreliable at responding to emergencies.

We don't have many cars that can even GO that fast to begin with. Ones that do are usually going to cost you 100,000 and up. A car affordable by the middle class that can hit 200?

Comparing a horse to a car vs a driverless car is really not even in the same ballpark in my opinion.

Horses can't go as fast as cars, simple.

Driverless cars are going to go slower or the same speed as manual cars.. because the limit isn't the driver, it's the engine and shit you put into the car.

338,bentreflection,"I'll respond to your comment as a sort of group response since there seems to be more than a few people both missing my point and proving it at the same time. Yes, I'm aware that we have cars that can go 200mph in certain circumstances and people who can drive a vehicle at 200mph in certain circumstances. Those circumstances are highly controlled and still quite dangerous even for professional drivers, which proves my point about how dangerous it would be for a non-professional driver to attempt to navigate through traffic at those speeds on a daily basis. To your other point, you're right the limit on top mechanical speed for a car isn't the driver, but speed limits exist specifically because of the limitations for the driver. There is a lot of room between 80mph and 200mph and even the cheapest cars can go 90mph which would be deemed unsafe for a manual driving car but not a self-driving car. Also, while you make an interesting point that going 200mph with our current internal combustion technology is prohibitively expensive, I think it's short-sighted to assume it will stay that way, especially in a subreddit like futurology. 


But enough about the 200mph example, there are infinitely more. We've already seen papers positing what the traffic patterns for self-driving cars might look like. How closely together they would be able to drive with their quicker reaction time, and look-ahead capabilities based on a communication network with the self-driving cars around them. How could a human hope to pilot a vehicle amidst of sea of much quicker moving, much tighter packed vehicles than our roadways already contain? What about when the traffic lights change and start communicating with the cars, directing them automatically like air traffic controllers with high-frequency directions in order to most efficiently route traffic? It just doesn't make sense to think about the future of self-driving cars in the context of a manual driver, other than as a transitionary period. If we do that we lose out on all the most exciting advances that self-driving technology can bring us and are left with the ability to read a magazine on the commute to work. That's cool but I want more.


Also, you're missing my point on the comparison between horses and cars.

339,I_love_kelp,"I think the implication is, that for many people who live in cities and have terrible public transport, they would be able to basically have self driving cars on call, much like an auto taxi and not need to own a car at all. If one wanted to, they could own one, and keep stuff in it, like a current car. And if you owned that car, it would presumably have a manual mode for certain situations, such as rural, off road, or emergency driving, much like a 4x4 setting. It could even drop you off, park somewhere else, and return when needed if you are somewhere with shitty parking, like LA or San Francisco. The plus of this situation is that you wouldn't HAVE to own a car anymore. You could rent it for a set period of time, or just a destination. You could rent the kind appropriate for the setting; truck for home depot, cruiser for the road trip. It would show up at your house and leave when needed.   
In a rural situation one would probably own a car with an auto setting placed by the manufacturer for customers in cities. You may not notice a change at all. In cities and suburban areas though, autocars would basically be like every car having its own driver 24/7 to do whatever it was told and possibly under a central traffic management to minimize traffic.

Or fiddle with cruise control and keep you at 100 mph with no ability to slow down, and make my own private remake of the movie Speed?

FWIW, I believe this will play out like any safety regulation.  Someday all new vehicles will be required to have a self-driving system.  However, existing cars will be exempted.   Keep in mind that initially self-driving cars will have to operate in a world full of human drivers, and do so much more safely to be accepted at all.

428,pdrop,"I think there are a few issues with some of your reasoning.

First - the just because something is challenging or impossible to enforce doesn't mean it shouldn't (or wont) be outlawed. Murder is illegal, we certainly can't prevent murders. For most of human history it was incredibly hard to even catch a culprit after the fact.

Second - It's easier to enforce a nationwide ban on manually driven cars than it is to ban it in specific areas. Governments have a monopoly on the public roads - your car needs a license plate, and a registration sticker to be street legal. States can simply stop licensing cars that allow manual-driving on public roads. Policing it becomes as routine as policing missing or fraudulent license plates is today.

Third - In the US anything smaller than a State basically has no say in the matter. If the DOT decide to make it mandatory, they have the ability to force the states to do what they want either through regulatory means or threatening to withhold funds.

Fourth - road fatalities are far more common than murder. In the US, it's greater than 2:1. For other developed nations the ratio of traffic fatalities to murders is even higher since America has an unusually high murder rate. Not that I think such a system would require a lot of enforcement (self driving cars would probably have means of reporting illegal vehicles on the road, making enforcement much more efficient), but I think it would be a very productive use of law enforcement.

I think when we get affordable, reliable technology to prevent significant death and carnage it will become a moral imperative to use it. When you can revoke the privilege of controlling a vehicle without loss of mobility, how do you really justify allowing people to manually drive their own cars on public roads?

I think one possible solution we'll see will be a ""supervised drive"" mode where a driver is allowed to control the car in some contexts, but automation will take over if the driver does anything illegal or dangerous.

Here's a simple question. Is the automated car allowed to break laws and drive in a manner that would be considered unsafe in other conditions? Because that seems like a liability nightmare for the manufacturer.

There will be large potholes that require driving over the line on the wrong side of the road or else you will destroy your car.

There are zero visible lane markings on any road, and even if you know where the lanes are supposed to be, using them as normal may be impossible. For example, the turn lanes may not get plowed out for days so everyone is making a left from a lane that is straight only according to the signs. Maybe the plow was over too far so people are driving half on the shoulder.

Hill ahead of you? Better speed up before you get to it to have the momentum to get over it, because trying to maintain speed on the hill will break traction and you'll slide back down and have an accident.

How about parking? I can guess where I should park, but it's just an expanse of flat white snow to the car.

Most of the cars manufactured will be that way, the old manual driver cars will still be out there and there will still be plenty of hobbyists who buy them and fix them up, etc.  But most people on the road won't be driving.

And yet there will still be millions of crashes and thousands of deaths every year and ALL of them will be caused by the manual driving vehicles.  It's at this point where the people who are still driving themselves around will need to justify their ""right"" to endanger everyone else on the road when everything we've seen says that self-driving cars are much safer.  It will also be at this point that we will begin to have the discussion about how we can severely increase the efficiency of our travel without manual driving cars on the road.

From there it will be a lot of argument, a lot of legal battles, a lot of information from both sides about the issue.  But in the end, it will come down to the fact that the new generations of people will have been raised with cars that take them where they want to go without having to know how to drive.

Teens, new voters, won't know how to drive and they won't care.  From the time they were 7 years old their Mom would put them in the car and the car would drop them off at school and they have no need/desire to do that themselves when they turn 16.  If they want to go to the movies or the mall, they just need permission from their parents and the car will take them where they want to go when they're only 12 years old...driving will stop being such a freedom milestone and will become more about getting around.

And those kids aren't going to care about some older folks who want to hold on to their ability to pilot their own vehicles.  They will want to be able to have their cars networked together and communicating with each other to allow them to drive 200mph down the highway in total safety, not be held back by someone who just wants to hang on to their hobby of driving.

It will be slow, it will take a LONG time, but eventually there will be so few people left who care about driving themselves around that the law will be easy to pass.",1426656964,cpiiuyf,t1_cpif9qt,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2015

&gt;I took a friend (who is a fantastic driver) off a state highway on a 90 degree exit at 60 miles an hour with the tail hung out so far he put his hand on the roof because he was SURE we were going over. This of course did not happen.

460,the_omega99,"&gt;To where will people be limited to drive, and will there be records of driving locations?

While a very valid concern, there's no reason for these kinds of limitations and issues to occur. Presumably there would have to be some way to give arbitrary instructions to a vehicle. There's too many edge cases of driving that can't be easily automated. Consider the case where we have to park in some country area without a normal parking lot. Or maneuvering a camper into a campsite. So it seems to me that applying limitations to where you can drive wouldn't really work.

While it's possible that governments could try and require the ability to stop unauthorized vehicles from entering certain areas (eg, military bases), that seems like a completely useless limitation because anyone who poses a threat could presumably get a manually driven vehicle.

So I highly doubt that they would place a limit on where to drive. In fact, I'm quite skeptical on the removal of *all* manual driving. While most driving is on official roads, there's still a need for driving off road or have unusual ways to maneuver that can't be easily explained to a machine.

As for keeping records of where people drive, governments could require this already, if they really wanted to. GPSes aren't very expensive and it's very doable to require all manufacturers to include a GPS in cars and for cars to maintain this GPS in the same way that cars must have a valid VIN. They don't do this because it's a major privacy violation that would not sit tight with voters (and probably against the laws of many countries).

Of course, we can expect that a self driving car would keep track of its own history. There's very valid reasons to do this, including the ability to map out where the car has been, finding stolen cars, ensuring your car isn't used without permission, testing fuel economy, and for quickly being able to return to places you've been (like how Google Maps lists the recently visited locations, which saves me from having to type up the address when I want to know what bus to take).

It is a very valid concern that such data could be used against you. We'll have to hope that laws requiring warrants and such will prevent this intrusion of privacy. I would expect, however, that there would be some way to clear your history just like how we can clear our browser history. Hell, I think a web browser is a great analogy here. It has a comprehensive history and cache that could be incriminating and spying on this history would be a violation of privacy. There's laws prohibiting police from being able to search your history without a warrant (although the issue of triple letter agencies overreaching is a very real concern). And like with a self driving car, the browser history isn't entirely local, but would be known by the ISP and services you use (like Google Maps).

462,the_omega99,"I agree. It's not a realistic view (at the time, anyway).

With that said, I would expect to see the number of people driving to plummet. With that, safety will go up greatly (since many bad drivers will be off the road) and there'd be fewer reasons to outlaw manual driving.

Further, with more options for transportation, we can easily raise the strictness of drivers exams to ensure that those who do drive can do it well. Right now it's not sustainable to require something like annual exams. But if the number of people driving was sliced to say, 1% of the current number, then it would be very doable.

With that said, I can think of some reasons that manual driving could become outlawed **in some places**. Not everywhere, since there's always going to be weird edge cases that can't be easily described to a computer. However, I can see things like ""no manual driving on city streets (without a permit)"".

One possible reason for this could be futuristic systems that don't work with manual drivers. For example, what if all the cars on the road were able to communicate with each other to raise efficiency? Imagine cars that can choreograph lane changes without signalling and no delays? So a car could shift several lanes over with other cars appropriately slowing down to allow for the shift. Such things are possible only for the quickly communicating and processing powers that computers have. We can't do that if there's even one manually driven car on the road.

Also of interest is that self-driving cars could potentially open new ways to move. For example, we sometimes talk about flying cars and mention things like ""people can't drive well in two dimensions; how are they going to handle three?"" Self driving cars could handle this extra complexity. And that's just one simple example. There's a number of ways that completely automated vehicles could improve efficiency.

As an aside, I'm not talking about something we'll see in the next decade. I'm talking closer to the scale of next century. And frankly, it's hard to say what the future will hold.

Secondly, it's silly to judge current technology of which is still in it's infancy (ex. vs sunlight) while making comments in regards to time. I can't comment on your lifetime statement, because you might be quite old and at the soon end of it. But ever? That's just silly to even think. Try in the next 50 years at most. 

That said, I'd like to point out that you're just a highly advanced machine yourself. Think about how the brain works, your body, your cells... It's not a matter of whether something artificially made can mimic human capabilities, it's a matter of time to allow technology to advance enough to do so. If something exists, then it's already not impossible, proven by the fact that it exists. We can't create things that already exist? Nonsense. We can't *currently*, perhaps. Existence is the proof of concept, technology is the only hurtle. 

Machines will not only be able to comprehend and react to things like unlisted construction zones and other obstacles, they will *surpass* human ability in that regard, because they will not have our limitations. We have two eyes, two ears, generalized physical feeling and a very complex brain compared to other current lifeforms on this planet. Machines *already* have the capability to have a multitude of all of those things. The main problem is that the technology driving each of those components is still advancing in a way that is much needed before we implement them fully into society. But let me ask you a question, can you see the infrared light spectrum? Can you see all of the spectrum's not only simultaneously but also without any loss on comprehension at all? Can you react quicker than any human being could ever hope to do in every single given situation without fail? Can you see all around your car, literally completely, simultaneously and without stop? Can you see further ahead than current human capability? In all directions? While also at all ranges? Simultaneously? Do you have literal instantaneous access to things like Radar, Lidar and GPS, among other things? 

It's not a matter of whether they can replace you or not. You exist. You are the proof of concept that your capabilities are possible to exist in this world. So it's only a matter of the technology, of which, I might point out, will surpass you and your capabilities a thousand to one, as it has always been and as it will always be, because you weren't designed with maximizing purpose in mind, you just came into existence randomly and everything that comes with that is literally nothing more than just simple extraordinary luck mixed with an *exorbitant* amount of time.

When self driving cars reduce auto related accidents and deaths by more than 90%, which they will do nearly immediately at the point where widespread acceptance and adoption happens, there will begin bans, because you can't justify human life against your simple *enjoyment* of the driving experience, which you will of course be able to fulfill just the same way we've always been able to. On tracks and the like, which I imagine will become a booming industry in some areas. Not all, of course. There's hardly a reason to disallow personal driving in low populated areas for example.

471,Simple_Jim,"Car A has unexpectedly changed speed. So Car B has to speed up or slow down in order to compensate. So far so good, right? What about Car C, which is following A? It also has to change speed. Same with D, E, F and G. And maybe the problem will be solved by now, as the cars are normalizing speed.

But what if car E can't speed up quickly enough? Many cars can't go from 60 to 65 miles per hour within the second or two requisite for this scenario to work. Or, even worse, what if all of these cars are slowing slightly, leading to a domino effect going backward, so that by the time cars H and I are involved, they have to cut a lot of speed very quickly? Trouble.

Now, lets look at the bigger picture. Journey time is not the only factor at play. Risk avoidance will also compel entities to take optimal action. Who are the entities when there is no human driver? The manufacturers and insurers of these vehicles. Why would they let their vehicles interact at high speed when all vehicles could just stop and negotiate the junction at a low speed? No accidents, ever.

On the network of cars- it'll exist, but it won't work as well as you imagine. First off, every vehicle would have to have a perfect connection at all times. Is that realistic? I don't think so. And these cars would have to trust each other. Will car A, a brand new luxury vehicle, trust car B's five year old sensor suite? How secure will this network be?

At the end of the day, every vehicle will be its own master, instructed by corporations which want it to be as safe as possible, and it'll rely on its own sensors with the wider network merely facilitating its travel, rather than dictating it.

481,YRYGAV,"&gt; Both human and computer drivers must obey the laws of physics. I doubt that having every car be automated will result in much of a speed improvement, except perhaps on interstates.

Why do you think current drivers are able to drive their cars so well the only thing holding them back are the laws of physics?

Self-driving cars would have better reaction time to something unexpected, be able to make perfect turns every time, would never get surprised by a corner, and would communicate with all nearby cars when they are moving, eliminating the possibility of hitting another car because they did something unexpected.  If they were all in a line, and the first one had to stop, they would all stop simultaneously, not one at a time as each human driver realizes the one ahead of them is stopping.

&gt; Really? Traffic jams are ultimately the result to too many cars being pushed through too few roads too quickly. Self-driving cars will increase that problem by putting even more cars on the road.

Well first of all, as I mentioned above self-driving cars can safely drive closer together because they don't rely on reaction time for lane changes or stopping.  They communicate and do it together.  You could have them safely nearly bumper to bumper on the highway.  If one needs to stop, they send out a signal for all the ones behind it to stop, and they stop together at the same rate, with none of them rear ending each other.

Second of all, there being too much traffic is just the necessary environment for a traffic jam, it's not the cause.  The cause of traffic jams is ultimately some human doing something stupid that causes a wave of braking to happen behind them, such as swooping in front of somebody when merging.  And it becomes self-sustaining, and that wave of braking propagates backwards for miles and everybody has to stop.  This would never happen with networked self driving cars, they would all slow down at a consistent rate, then speed up afterwards.

The human solution to being stopped in a traffic jam is to accelerate too much after being stopped, then run into the guy in front of them and brake again, and the person behind them does the same thing, and everybody is just driving a few feet then stopping.

Self driving cars would communicate and accelerate at a uniform, steady rate simultaneously.  They wouldn't need to worry about the person in front of them running out of space and braking again, because all the cars on the road are doing the same speed.  The traffic jam would just melt away.

Traffic jams are caused by a human's lack of proper communication, and high reaction times.",1426677978,cpinpss,t1_cpiffd0,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2015

Think about how tires react in rain, or how well brake pads perform.  Will current cars handle as well at 100MPH as they do at 50MPH?

Why do you think reaction time (which is reduced from perhaps a second or two to milliseconds)  will result in such a large increase in speed?  Except for the traffic jam scenario, I don't see it having any significant influence at all.

&gt; You could have them safely nearly bumper to bumper on the highway.

I don't see how that can possibly be safe.  Regardless of the driver, cars needs a certain distance to brake.  Everyone is assuming that these new cars will never have a mechanical failure, or hit a road defect or pedestrian.



&gt;This [wave of breaking] would never happen with networked self driving cars, they would all slow down at a consistent rate, then speed up afterwards.

Whoa there.  I wouldn't necessarily jump to that conclusion.  Networked computers still have propagation delays and still can exhibit the wave like behavior (albeit much less frequently or less intense).  And then you have issues of how quickly a car can slow down; different cars and different loads will have different rates.  

And you still will have instances where there are sudden stops such as accidents (will still happen, but probably mostly due to hardware failure like a blown tire)

24,Simple_Jim,"You keep talking about this ""driver"" in the Google car. That is a fundamental problem.

The driver of a vehicle is the entity which exercises control. Acceleration, braking, and particularly steering.

It is a *self-driving car*. **It** is the driver.

Any human in that vehicle is a *passenger* while the vehicle is in autonomous mode.

Would you say that a passenger in a car caused an accident if they didn't grab the wheel when a human driver made a mistake?

The person who could have assumed control in this vehicle may have to justify his actions to Google, his employers, but he didn't cause the accident.

That person did assume that the bus would stop. But *so did the Google car*, which was in control of itself. The Google car made the mistake. It tried to negotiate an obstacle- which it was meant to do- but it did so in a negligent fashion. The car was the author of this misfortune, that is the truth, and it is to blame.

The car will be reprogrammed to make sure this doesn't happen again. That is the only truth you should be adhering to.",1456913363,d0kjvfp,t1_d0jfe73,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016
25,Ser_NSFW,"I'm not arguing that the Google car wasn't controlling the car. The only reason there was a human being in the Google car was for control and safety, in the event the car made a mistake, or something like this happened. Since there was a Google employee in the Google car who was in charge of ensuring no actual accidents happened, and since self-driving cars are obviously not going to be as impulsive as a human driver (even when finished), it's ridiculous to say the automated car caused its first accident, when A: both humans admitted fault, and B: the car did exactly what it was designed to do.

I see this as one big mass of human error, with the initial blame going to the Google car in the article link. The article actually explains what happens, and the title does not fit the tone of the article, so somewhere along the line I assume someone with marketing/SEO experience jazzed up the article to attract readers, not convey the truth. But in this case, I'm assuming that the truth must be in an article's title, since it's usually the first thing about an article people see and it sets the tone for their expectations.

26,yo_radical_one,"&gt;Yes, after tens of millions of miles driven they finally had an accident that appears to be the result of them pulling around a construction zone and a bus deciding that stopping was a bad idea. The jury is still out as to who's at fault, but we know that the car could theoretically acted to prevent it.

This is why I have so much respect for Google, they admitted some level of fault in the sense that a human driver could have reacted, they saw an area to improve their own technology and I'm sure in a matter of months they will be working on a solution.

As far as I'm aware, the bus was still in the wrong in the absolute sense because it didn't stop at the stop sign.

If the flight is $300-500 and the car rental another $150-200, we get into potentially substantial savings for your middle class travelers, especially if there are multiple tickets for the flight. 

On a trip that is 2 hours by air, or 10 to 12 hours by car, the traveler inputs his destination and leaves in the evening after work. They can read, watch TV, and sleep while the car travels, arriving at the destination, with a car for local travel, only having to check-in to their hotel.

I get this guy's points but at the same time this isn't unlike how things were years ago when the first ""insert new vehicle feature"" here where you had no choice but to go to the dealerships for servicing.

Every person I've ever met has been extremely creative in their own ways. Do you watch the Shark Tank? It's a good example of extremely different levels of creativity that come from people of all backgrounds. 

&gt;Not everyone can become an engineer, and the number of jobs that will be replaced by robots will not require enough engineers to replace said jobs.

Not just engineers are involved in creating robots. They are a product that gets sold and like every other product it needs to be R&amp;D'd, marketed, sold, accounted, tested, meet government checks etc, all the things that go into a business that sells products.

&gt;Do you really think that by 2050 we'll still have any humans doing driving or service jobs?

Well are you sure the United States as a whole is even going to allow self-driving cars without humans in them by 2050? When it does eventually happen I do expect large businesses to adapt self-driving vehicles but still expect individual drivers to have a role because their vehicles will cost significantly less to own and maintain.  I'm fairly positive humans will still play a large role in the service industry, I expect people to prefer an honest response to their questions instead of hearing a robot's pre-programmed response of which wine it prefers.

&gt; Have you seen the latest boston dynamics videos? The robots in those videos are incredibly lifelike. They just need better batteries(battery tech has been steadily advancing for decades) and to become cheaper, and then there's no reason we can't use them to eventually replace manual labor jobs.

Of course, but currently one of those robots can't do close to the variety of things a human can do. Maybe my business requires a person who can paint, who can mow the lawn, who can pick up a package, who can take calls, write invoices, prepare packages etc. We can do that with robots easily, but right now we need a lot of them and we only need one human.

We will see a day where we create a robot that is capable of doing those things, but I think it's at least 100 years away, and then even longer until it is affordable to the general market.

When we do reach that point where we have affordable robots doing all the mundane human jobs, hopefully our governments are ensuring the benefits are being directed towards the population and not select individuals.

My biggest issue with it is the amount. If it sticks around $500 (increasing with inflation) as Ontario is going to do I have no issues with that. It's enough people can get by (barely) and still ensures people will be motivated to work to have a better life.

I wonder if they could train their system to pilot self driving cars, having it learn all the explicit and implicit rules of driving autonomously by training it in a virtual world with realistic driving physics, terrain, and other traffic. Say it worked perfectly you would be faced with the dilemma that it's basically a black box and you can't really tell how and why it follows the rules, nor guarantee it always will.

We already have some automation in terms of some of our equipment. The AED is a great example. For basic life support trucks (ie EMT basics and not paramedics), we have to same device you see in public. You stick on the pads and it shocks. Some places even have machines that can do CPR. Some places have automatically loading stretcher. 

These all require some human input though. I have to put the pads on, or put the CPR machine on the patient, or set up the stretcher for loading (plus getting the patient on the stretcher) 


For the future, I think self driving cars with probably be the first thing we see. You will still require 2 people (for CPR calls we typically have 4 or more people in multiple vehicles), but you have more flexibility. You could have one EMT basic in the transport ambulance, and a paramedic in a ""fly car"", so the EMT is able to handle the routine, BLS stuff, with a paramedic readily available if need be. Some places already have a system like this (without the autonomous car's obviously, plus 2 EMT's in the transport vehicle and one paramedic in the fly car) 

I think it'll be a while before robots replace us completely. It'd need to be a very maneuverable, very strong robot with a more or less general AI. There's a lot of variables in emergency medicine, which I'm sure we have robots already that could tell what is happening, but one that can do that and also go to the 6th floor walk up, bring the patient down, and perform emergency procedures is still a little bit off.

(Directed) Machine Learning involves giving a goal to the AI, so for a self-driving car, something like ""drive without hitting anyone"", and a bunch of sample data, and then letting it come up with an algorithm that can accomplish that goal even when given new data it hasn't encountered before (not in the sample set).

(Undirected) Machine Learning does find patterns itself, so for example if you give it 100 pebbles, 50 red and 50 blue, it will be able to group them into red and blue sets (even though it might not use those words) without being told that there are red and blue sets to group them into. But there are still a lot of variables that can be tweaked by programmers to achieve different results (not quite the same, but think the 'magic wand' tool in photoshop that has a tolerance that can be adjusted).

AI is a tool that just does what you tell it, and as mentioned, this type of AI is much closer than any sort of true AI.

Where things get interesting is if you give it a goal such as ""act like a human"". If it is successful and passes the turing test do you consider it sentient? Even though it goal was given to it by it's creator?

And if you want to take the point above to an extreme, say you give it the goal ""act like a human"" and it scans all of human history, sees how many wars we have, etc. and concludes that humans are violent so to act like a human it too must be violent. (This is both the exciting and frightening thing about AI like AlphaGo. It often acts in efficient, but unexpected or unpredictable ways. Just because you give it a goal doesn't mean it will achieve that goal in the way you wanted or expected.)

AlphaGo is supposedly a 10 year leap forward and will likely be in the hands of most militaries in the next decade or so.

DARPA was founded in 1958 as a result of the launch of Sputnik as US military planners feared they were technologically behind the Soviets. From then until the 1980s, their focus was developing technology in a sort of race against the Soviets (who also had pretty advanced tech to keep up with the Americans). When the Cold War ended, DARPA was left doing various projects that increasingly were not tied strictly to defense, such as self-driving vehicles, robotics, and more recently neural connectivity related to the BRAIN initiative.

While China's rapid advancement in technology mainly has had to do with stealing US blueprints and reverse engineering the technology, this could be a signal that China wishes to actually start making its forays into experimental, unproven technology as the Soviets started doing in the 1950s.

This also means there is a higher possibility the US and China could enter into a technological arms race of sorts, and that both countries could substantially expand their Defense R&amp;D to make sure they have an edge over the other.

What else does this mean? Everything that's still sort of experimental right now, such as exoskeletons, nanorobotics, hypersonic aircraft, energy weapons, and yes, even spaceflight, are all going to dramatically accelerate in development over the next 20 years.

speeds are not being achieved anywhere in the world, including on the most advanced systems.

where HSR trains must operate more slowly than circumstances allow in, for example, France.

would take 3 hours and 41 minutes—59 minutes longer than the statutory requirement of 2 hours,
42 minutes. In the future, the CHSRA’s travel times may be further lengthened by train weight and
safety issues and also by political demands to add stops to the system.

I have a lot of friends working in the AI space (a couple in Google X, which is the subdivision of Alphabet working on all their crazy shit like self-driving cars) and they all don't seem to be overly worried about AI taking over non-routine/cognitive jobs within 20 years. The general sentiment seems to be that they think there will be massive change and increased automation of manual low-skill jobs, but that actual ""thinking"" jobs are pretty safe at least within our lifetimes and that all the concerns about AI taking over doctors and lawyers are completely overblown by laymen who don't actually know that a lot of AI technology is still incredibly primitive compared to what humans are capable of. 


Machines are really, really good at some things (scanning, searching, structured building, two-person interactions, process management), and those are the things that will be automated. Machines are really, really poor at other things (exception handling, multi-person systems, initial design, self-improvement), and those are likely the things that won't be automated for a much longer time.

The examples given in the article are self driving cars, AI that can answer phones and solve customer problems, and AI that can act as personal assistants. These are just a few of the many types of machine learning projects out there. Lets say in 10 or so years these technologies get to the point where they are significantly better ( not flawless) at these tasks than their human counter parts. 

The self driving cars would could put anyone who drives a car as a living out of a job. The transportation industry is the largest employer of americans. Next lets look at the AI that can asses customer complaints by phone. Every single person who answers questions over the phone would be out of a job. This includes IT guys, customer service, HR people, telemarketers, and countless other people i cannot think of. Combine this with the personal assistant AI and basically every secretary and non executive office worker could be out of a job. 

Now this is the part that you are not considering: Job Retraining. What happens the the 10's of millions of people who got displace quite suddenly. Saying ""well more jobs will come out"" only helps the kids in middle school at the time. They would be the only ones young enough to adapt. The 55 year old truck driver, IT guy, secretary, etc is not going to be able to go back school and learn a new highly skilled job. This age bracket could extend all the way to people in their late 20's who just cannot go back to school.

This is why people are freaking out. They are not concerned the children of tomorrow won't find jobs. They are concerned that this will hit when they are 50 and they won't be qualified for any of these fancy new jobs. ",1458176432,d12puvo,t1_d12hjhl,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016

However the point of all of this is the great number of jobs which can be eliminated within a few years from each other. Where will the 10's millions of people go (just in america) who were impacted by only 3 self learning AI programs to get retrained? 

As far as people in their late twenties going back to university to get trained for technical jobs , I do not have a bright outlook on it. From here on I only have personal experience and observations to draw on. A lot of people who are in these professions have children. Going back to school and trying to raise children is not an easy task. Is it possible, of course. However many will not have the family resources necessary  to go back school. Ask someone who has children and is a single parent if they think they would be successful in going back to university for a technical degree. 

Like i said the problem is not young people finding jobs in emerging fields. As in this example it is nearly 20% of the work force in the span of a few years needing retrained because of being displaced by only 3 self learning AI's of which there are many more. Write now in software learning there are programs whose whole purpose is to write other programs to perform specialized tasks. This means if your job is primarily writing code on the computer, your job is susceptible to AI. That adds a lot more people to the list who need retraining.

I also just fundamentally disagree when you say are advancement is not accelerating. Take a look at tech level of the year 1600 compared to the year 1800. Those two worlds do not look very different.

I imagine in this future world, freed from work, most of us would delve into the areas of interest we had that we never got to pursue.  In my case, I loved playing the guitar in high school.  I would play 6 hours a day.  At some point I had to decide between trying to make a go with music, or going to school and getting a traditional career.  I chose college and a career, and I forever regret it but it pays the bills.  I now don't have the time to get back into it.  A lot of times, doing 40 hours of work in a week mentally exhausts you and so like you said, this 'free time' is really just putting your brain on relax mode and you don't do a whole lot of useful things.

Perhaps our grandchildren won't have to make such a sacrifice and will be so much happier.  It fills me with joy at the thought that someday our ancestors will be artists and musicians, philosophers and scientists not because they had to choose these in order to survive, but because they loved these things and put their hearts into them.  I think we'd actually advance even faster than before since people would likely only do things they really wanted to do.

I have great hope for the future, with a sadness that I won't be alive to see most of these things come true (I'm middle aged now).

On the other hand, I've witnessed the age of computers, the Internet, smartphones, video games, and soon self driving cars.  I work in tech and these things are understandable from a tech perspective but sometimes I just stand back in awe.. self driving vehicles were a plot device in movies when I was a child and soon they will be here.

167,moolah_dollar_cash,"I think regulation is so important for making sure these technologies are rolled out in a way that's a net gain for safety.  

Car drivers need guidelines of how to interact with self driving features that are clear and translatable from one car make to another. And we need actual evidence that a self driving feature is a net gain for safety before it's allowed onto roads where it could be a risk not just for a car driver but other road users. This is really important for systems where the car is sort of in control but sort of not or needs an alert human behind the wheel ready to take control at a moments notice, done badly those systems could be a net loss for safety and I really don't think that should be allowed to happen.  

Don't get me wrong I'm all for innovation and experimentation but everyday drivers should not be lab rats and if these companies want to test new features they should do that with trained employees or drivers who are more informed than just being given a vague warning that they are using a beta feature (here's looking to you Tesla) so we can be confident they will actually stay alert and able to take back control of the car. 

I also think when we start to move into the situation where cars can actually be in full control for portions of a journey (like on motorways for example) that we should only be allowing that if a car can get to a safe place to stop if the driver becomes unable to retake control of the car. And we need clear transitions between the fully autonomous and human driving where the human can prove they are aware and back in control of the car. 

It's really not hard to imagine someone putting on a self driving feature when they are tired, falling asleep and then not being awake or alert when they are needed to be in control. If there was a system where the car couldn't come to a safe stopping point that could be incredibly dangerous.

So yeah I think we need standards to make sure we have safe self driving cars and not a hodgepodge of features that promise safer driving but leave all road users worse off. ",1458184923,d12uvdx,t3_4appsr,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016

174,OliverSparrow,"Gordon's point is that the transformation between 1870 and 1940 was radical in a way that what is happening today is not. He argues that the great improvements - in health, accommodation, political and legal institutions - are all now qualitatively in place and that everything else is tinkering at the margin. 

Economists see change as deriving from three things: inputs of capital -'investment' - labour scale and the growth of quality and productivity. Technology and management talent are the two drivers of quality and productivity. Gordon sees the great days of capital and labour as being behind us, extreme managerial talent as needed merely to stay still and future technology as being economically marginal. To justify this, 
he turns to recent history. Productivity growth has indeed been marginal for the past thirty years - and chiefly down to trade rather than technology - and we are piling efficiency-defeating regulation onto our industries. Additionally, we are all getting old in the industrial world - half of Europe will be over 65 in 2030, three quarters of Japan - and even China has a demographic problem. 

Future-fanciers will, of course, see this as heresy. Self-driving cars that play Go! Mars or bust! More cogently, if you put yourself in 1870s - the height of the agricultural depression, but prior to answering urbanisation and industrialisation - would you feel that optimistic? 

What is lacking is a coherent story about the future and how it may turn out. Wild arm-waving about singularities won't do. The future will be primarily defined by how the nine billions manage not to tread on each other's toes: politics, international affairs, trade. Technology will change industries, to be sure, and it may even create some new ones. (Those will, however, take 30-40 years to rise above single digit contributions to world product.)

195,notpandora,"&gt; As someone in this industry, it has nothing to do with the social aspect and everything to do with mistrust and convenience.

This exactly. Example; I enjoy fresh coffee and fancy espresso drinks. I don't have the time or equipment to make these myself at home. So I go to Starbucks. Anyone who likes espresso drinks, especially at Starbucks, can tell you that there is a lot of options that they don't put on the menu, and when there is a line of half a dozen people behind you, it can be daunting to grill the barista on what the heck a misto is, or what type of milk is better for a cappuccino, or what does it mean to get your drink ""upside down"". It's a common joke that ""Starbucks fans"" will go in with these long complicated orders for their favorite drinks.

Anyways, the app, currently in beta mode, allows you to pick (at least some of\*) these options at your own pace, maybe looking up ""ristretto"" or whatever customization you've never heard of before. Same deal with, for example, Panera Bread app or any other not-so-fast-food place that can have a long line. You can put in your fancy order and, best of all, it's sitting there waiting for you when you come for it. I cannot tell you how much I love being able to just roll up to Panera Bread, skip the line, grab my order and get out in under 30 seconds. I'm saving time for myself and for all the other people waiting in line too. 

I've tried other services like PeaPod - an online grocery ordering &amp; delivery service but unfortunately the kink in that one is you can't pick your own produce so I've often gotten bruised or even mouldy fruit (berries can be delicate, especially if you have a later delivery time) so I stopped using that. ""Millenials"" like myself are min-maxers. We want to get the most out of our time and our money, since we tend to have limited resources of both. If I'm getting food from a place like Panera or 5 Guys, it's because I don't have the time to cook it myself. If I don't even have time to make a damn sandwich or a salad, I sure as hell don't want to waste an equivalent amount of time standing on line and waiting for my sandwich to be made.

Additionally, I am always curious as to whether these companies use the data from the ordering apps to adjust business practices like supplies ordering, staffing, etc. I remember watching a video [link here](https://youtu.be/wGhgQid3-ak) about Japanese conbini (convenience stores) tracking transactional data, demographic data, etc, to such a degree that they are able to automate delivery based on thousands of factors - as a made up example, women tend to buy more sweet snacks at the beginning of the week than at the end of the week, so automate restocks of sweet snacks to arrive on Sunday, and schedule additional employees for evening times on Monday and Tuesday to tidy the shelves and restock the sweets during and after post-work shopping. 

Data privacy is a huge issue right now, and many seem to believe Millenials and the current generation of teens and young adults ""don't care"" about our data being farmed, but I think we care a great deal - we *want* it farmed, and experiences customized for us for maximum benefit and convenience. It makes me more mad to think it's being collected and then nothing being done with it besides maybe selling my email address and demographic statistics to some other analytics or marketing company. 

Watching the technology currently on the horizon, the common theme is its potential to cater to the desire of maximizing resource (time and money) efficiency of the consumer. Self-driving cars is a big one. Telecommuting is another trend that is rising rapidly, as Millenials look for places with lower cost of living - combine that with the Google Fiber spread we are all hoping for and the costs of doing business will flatten out around the country, and bring more white collar jobs back into the US as people can afford to take lower salaries in exchange for the benefits of working from home, and companies can hire more employees without having to foot the bill associated with running work facilities.

The main challenge to all of this is, to quote Star Wars, is ""lack of vision"". The status quo is entrenched in the technology and social-work expectations of decades ago. I have a 60+ minute commute each way to work, but my boss only agreed to allow me to telecommute after 1. he bought a condo in Florida and experienced the benefits himself and 2. I told them I was moving out of state regardless and they knew there was too much work in the queue to find a replacement and not set themselves back even further. There are so many benefits that are ours to reap if only we allow ourselves to question what about the ""old ways"" were only satisfactory because we had no viable alternative.

\* This rant came a long way from talking about coffee, but I'm hoping they add the full list of options to the Starbucks app. I haven't been able to find a way to order my favorite ""custom"" drink yet - grande unsweetened soy green tea latte, double dirty. It sounds bizarre but it's delicious.",1458308645,d14hefs,t1_d147nte,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016

If executives are to have their way, Google X will be shut down altogether, and, instead of leading innovation through moonshots no one else does, we will see the company adhere to maximizing shareholder revenue by stretching incremental technological improvements over as long as possible and making them as proprietary as possible - the same process which turned Apple and Microsoft from industry flagships into dinosaurs.

Here's the problem with what's ahead for us in the next decade.  Gas stations already don't need people at them.  

Grocery/dept stores are getting rid of cashiers for self check out lanes, that's if you even go to the store.

Deliveries will be done more and more by drone or self driving truck.

Presuming you even need someone to bring you something, and you don't just go to your 3d printer to print it out.

Small time, minimum wage jobs, which makes up most of our work now, will go away.  And they will keep going away at an increasing rate.  They're not just going overseas (that will eventually not be financially viable either, most manufacturers are having to move inland on china, because there's too many people who can pick their jobs, and not do them at slave wages.)

Middle management, white collar jobs will dry up mostly because there is no one to manage, but also because they too can mostly be automated.  Counting items and money doesn't require a person.

AI will slowly take over the non-repetitive jobs, and eventually corporations will be replaced by an AI that makes predictions and runs the company because it can do it better than the CEO's.  The board will vote on changes to the AI, but really, the AI will be the real decision maker.

We are reaching a point that anything a person can do, a machine can do better.  There is no need for anyone to produce in this society.  So either:

1)  We give all the money to the people who own the machines and everyone else can just go fuck themselves.

205,Dicho83,"&gt;And before you say, ""but this time it's different"".

But this time, it actually *is* different. 

When cars replaced horses, farriers  (guys who shod horses), could become tire mechanics. There weren't already people in those jobs, so there was a demand. 

Now (in the near future), when our self-driving cars need new tires, there's a robot that checks the pressure, removes the tire, rotates, and replaces them without a single human involved. 

Sure we need a guy to supervise, but that one guy can watch 10 bays at once. What happens to the other 9 mechanics? What jobs do they take? 

Let's not forget the truck drivers, mass transit drivers, taxi cab and uber drivers. They are all looking for jobs, just like the tire mechanics. 

Every global report on the subect, states there is already a *net* loss of jobs in the millions and expected to only grow over the next few years. 

When AIs mature (several are already in use), customer service and support call centers will see wide spread layoffs.  Most routine issues will be resolvable without human interaction  (anyone who has worked support knows that's easily 80-90% of the job).

You say we are running around screaming that the sky is falling. I say your head is stuck in the sand (or elsewhere).

The article specifically mentions that this is for use in cities, which seems quite unrealistic. Unless we dig underground tunnels for all the cars or they get the ability to fly this does not seem like it will ever be useful.

Sitting in a car making a hairpin turn like that around a corner (especially in the narrow city streets here in Europe) at full speed would smoosh all passengers up against each other and the side of the car. Fragile cargo would suffer as well. It would also be somewhat reckless driving in the winter, where the roads get a lot more slippery in the northern reaches of the world.

Here in Europe at least (and Holland/Scandinavia especially), you will have many more bikes than cars crossing most intersections. So unless they too become self-driving, you end up with the exact same problems as now. And as long as people are around you need a way for them to get across the streets.

231,Ghiren,"Low wage and unskilled are actually harder to automate. The advancements of automation and AI seem to be coming in three main fields.

Automating data management - Computers manage data all the time, so things like sorting database entries or selecting the best stocks are fast to automate. OP's article is an example of this.

Automating user experience - This is one part human psychology (UI design), one part determining data relevance. Cortana, Google Now, and Siri are good examples of this, as they can decide data that is relevant to you. Art is a harder example, but you're still deciding on a display that fits the psychology of your viewer.

Automating physical tasks - This is tricky because the real world doesn't always like to play along with virtual/mental models. Humans are still better at working with incomplete models, and are more flexible when that model changes. Robots have better sensors and the changes that they can react to are handled almost instantaneously. We're not there yet, but I'd hate to be a truck or taxi driver when self-driving cars take off.

236,EryliaStarheart,"I have a nagging suspicion that it's not just about return on investment. It's likely that Google purchased BD in order to attempt to integrate their deep learning algorithms with BD's platforms. This could've gone wrong for several legitimate reasons:

- The hardware is incapable of feedback required for reinforcement learning.
- The hardware, despite its apparent feats of balance and agility, can't self-adjust beyond a narrow range of parameters and needs to be calibrated manually.
- The code is a mess achieved through trial and error, and requires to be changed over and over again with each alteration of hardware, dramatically slowing progress (as opposed to being an easily scalable and transferrable model of ""how to animate any biped"")
- The people in charge of programming do not appreciate Google telling them they are doing things wrong and that their doubtlessly hard and honest work is worth little because they chose the wrong direction to begin with.

If this is, indeed, the case, then what we have here is Google's declaration that it's not interested in so called ""Periphery progress"". Rather than painstakingly working on a single robot model for years, it might be more prudent to develop a generic algorithm for humanoid robots that would work with -any- hunk of junk that meets a broad range of prerequisites. Nowhere has this been more apparent than in Google's own development model for self-driving cars: there have been many models of sensing and computing equipment, but the autopilot can make sense of the data they provide. They don't have to start development from scratch because they decided to switch from lidar to optical sensors.

As amateur futurists, we understand that Atlas is a manifestation of progress whereas a lifelike ""actroid"" is a well-crafted, but ultimately pointless animatronic doll. Perhaps this is what Google engineers, after thorough examination, decided about Atlas as well, or at least the software that drives it.",1458444326,d16dik3,t3_4b5b49,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016

Recall, democracy was not at this time a sure-fire winner. After the general fall of monarchy in WWI, people were looking for an alternative that gave authoritative guidance from the centre. Totalitarians thought that a properly mobilised technocratic society, operating under centralised plans, could achieve things about which a muddled bunch of democratic farmers could only dream. Space elevators, singularities, self-driving Go machines: these were a destiny that only the visionary leader could seize and make real. And such men would be torn down and blocked from action by petty bourgeois notions of liberty, choice, individual lives lived quietly to local goals. Futurists glorified war as a purgative, a hygienic function, by which petty elements would be eradicated.

244,Ameren,"&gt; That's a big assumption

I'm not making an assumption, I'm just giving you my professional opinion. For all the advances we've made in terms of computing power over past decades, we've struggled with very basic things that human beings take for granted, like vision, fine motor skills, and language comprehension. Not being able to do those kinds of things outside of highly controlled environments severely limited what we could achieve with fully autonomous tech. We'd make some progress, there'd be a lot of hype, and then we'd hit another wall and funding would vanish. It was very much a boom/bust cycle.

But in the past decade or so, we've made tremendous progress, due to a convergence of multiple factors. The ready availability of data of all kinds, dirt cheap computing power, and things like deep learning. There's a lot of buzz around deep learning and some would say that it's a rebranding of neural networks, and I don't want to focus on the particulars. What is making these kinds of techniques useful is that we're able to replace logic with algebra, and algebra can be massively parallelized across GPUs. That's the way that I like to explain it, anyway.

In areas like computer vision, we've made more progress in the last 6 years than we had in the previous 60. Take the ImageNet object recognition/localization challenge ([example](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ILSVRC-Figure1-624x258.png)). In 2010, the top performer had an error rate of 28%. In 2011, 26%. In 2012, 16%. In 2013, 12%. In 2014, 7%. And in the 2015 competition, **a 3.567% error rate**. One researcher estimated that humans still have a 1.5% lead on the same task, but machines are likely to outpace us soon. For very specific recognition tasks like facial recognition, machines already do a better job than humans (as of last summer, anyway).

The economic implications of this cannot be understated. Breakthroughs like these mean that we'll be able to integrate machines into workflows where previously they could not be used (e.g. robots in car manufacturing are usually powerful but blind, and have to be isolated in big cages so that they don't dismember people.) Self-driving cars are just one example of how advances in computer vision enable autonomous tech to operate side-by-side with human beings in dynamic, real world situations.

But I'm just scratching the surface here. There's a **lot** of interesting work going on right now, and it's on track to have huge economic impacts.

Mechanical computers do indeed date back to the 17th century but mechanical computers are not the same as digital computers, I also didn't use the computer itself as an example even though it entirely belongs to the 20th century since neither the theory or the technology to build one existed prior to 1900.

Your second example is silly, you're just creating a strawman since I was talking about the very specific theory and inventions that form a fundamental part of these technologies and not all of the general field of study that made them possible.  The cell network example I gave serves to illustrate this, the basic components of hexagonal grids with each tower serving three cells and the switching system that allows multiple callers to use the same frequency are the inventions that make cell networks possible.  They're the things that would appear on the patent for such a system.  Likewise, taking modern rocketry as an example now, the first actual theory was developed by Tsiolkovsky in the early 1900s with the development of the rocket equation and the proposal of using liquid fuels instead of solid.  Goddard did all of the fundamental experiments for liquid fuel involving use of fuel and oxidizer tanks, turbines, and combustion chambers, really ground breaking stuff that had never been tried before in rocketry.  That's the sort of work that can be thought of as taking the first steps towards the goal of landing people on the moon.

Now, back to the original topic.  Self driving cars, as they exist now, are one of the inventions I would ascribe to the 21st century since even though they make use of a lot of prior work done on artificial intelligence, automation, computer modelling, etc. they are a novel application of it and much of the necessary hardware and theory is being developed along the way.  I don't really consider them as a solved problem though, there's still a lot that needs to be done before they can be used everywhere and in every circumstance but they are on the path to get there just as the Wright brother's plane or Goddard's rockets were the predecessors of the ultimate achievements of widely available commercial flight and the Moon landings and space travel in general.",1458651580,d1923pw,t1_d18t2st,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016

But I think in more recent times (last 2 decades or so), we've seen much more progress come from the private commercial sector than the military one.

SpaceX is one example, Tesla could be another, smartphones are another (the military is adopting iPhones and Android smartphones, rather than making its own), Oculus is another (the military had its own ""VR"" goggles, but the most ""cutting edge"" tech they had still looked like those expensive VR goggles from the 90's).

There are a lot more examples we can give from the private sector: AI, biotech, fusion, quantum computers, self-driving vehicles, solar panels, etc. 

So I don't buy the ""we need the military to spend hundreds of billions a year so we can have progress"" idea. With the same money, I think we could get 10x the progress in the private sector.

It's certainly not like if we didn't spend that money on the military ""we wouldn't have progress anymore or nearly as much"". No, I don't buy that *at all*.

And if you're *still* skeptical that some things just can't be done in the private sector, then I'd *much rather* give $300 billion a year to NASA than spend it on building weapons. Think about the things NASA could build with that kind of money, and how much faster we could be getting the ""space age"" - and even better if some of that money goes to the private sector to *build stuff for NASA*, as it would probably build it more efficiently (but wouldn't build them at all, unless the government guaranteed income for those projects).

An example I like to give is this: if you give the money to the military, they are likely to build the ""weapons systems of the future that would be put on space ships"". But if you give the money to NASA, they are more likely to build the ""actual spaceships of the future"" (the military is far more focused on building Earth ships than space ones). Which do we need or want faster? The spaceships, right?

In terms of accommodation, we would see a migration from the suburban model to two extremes, some would migrate to self-sustaining small isolated communities, advances in remote working and faster transportation enabling them to do so, while others would live on top of each other in spacious flats inside tall skyscrapers within more compact cities.

In terms of environment, agricultural advances (vertical farming and lab-grown animal products), along with the compacting of our cities, would mean a return to wilderness for a lot of land. Extensive carbon capture powered by cheap fusion results in steadily dropping carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, carefully monitored as to not trigger an ice age. Pollution and contamination from the past are also being cleaned up.

In terms of transport, the most common will be a self-driving ground taxi system that people use for personal transportation and commuting. The network will span most continents, though those willing to pay a bit more (or who are somewhere more isolated) can use a point-to-point aerial taxi service that is quicker. People might prefer to use this when going longer distances, such as on holiday. Bullet trains, conventional and maglev, will also serve as intercity transport, and intra-city transit will also include slower trains. Supersonic/hypersonic aircraft will also serve more distant cities.

In terms of space travel, there will be several space stations orbiting earth, a rapidly growing lunar colony, and a small but reasonably established Martian presence. We may also have completed a space elevator, but I expect we will still rely on SSTO spaceplanes for most trips. Interstellar travel is still a pipe dream, but we will be getting there slowly.

In terms of health, advances in biology, genetics and bionics have resulted in large improvements. Paralysis is a thing of the past, thanks to either advanced biological repair or mechanical augmentation. Same with amputations, either with lab-grown replacements or mechanical ones. Some may even choose superior mechanical augmentations over their biological ones, Deus Ex style.

In terms of work, well, automation means we a lot of low level jobs will be obsolete, and many will live on a basic income, perhaps supplemented by occasional subsidised piece work. Reduced costs of goods due to cheap fusion energy and a more circular resource economy means they will still be able to afford a comfortable and stimulating existence.

274,McDevalds,"Sorry about the slow reply, I don't use this one much lately...

I agree, it *should* be easy to avoid, but the likely scenario is that will make it safer for driving/safety/or whatever XYZ reason -  neither me or you can think of at the moment. Military aircraft are networked. Especially drones. And that's not even for safety, or a pilot, that's just necessary for operating. We had a drone flying near or over Iran that Iran hacked, and basically...landed, and commandeered. lol A classified surveillance drone, and...now it's theirs. And this wasnt even a regular drone operated by the military. It was one of our most classified ones. (This happened a couple years ago, if you wanna google it) The Iranians just basically (iirc faked the ground control signals - and jammed the real ones, and they simply landed it where they wanted it in their territory) Boom. Iran suddenly got access to our most classified surveillance technologies. Ugh. I'm a Defense &amp; Security Fellow, so this stung a lot. lol

Anyway, I digressed, but my main point was, if it's networked, it can be hacked. (And tactually often, even if it isn't!) 

Currently, in the near term, cars WILL drive themselves on the road. I believe there are going to be many growing pains, cuz it's not like everyone is gonna have a brand new self driving car next year. It's an evolution. I think just a week or so ago, a google self driving car had its first accident - other accidents were where the Google engineer interfered with something. But this is the first time, it was the cars fault. I foresee the industry just saying, ""Look, we should have some kind of anti collision system for these cars."" At the SAME time, you have vehicles with more and more access to the regular internet for people streaming, diagnostics (check out the newest BMW's), etc. Google remote car hacking, or search it out on YouTube. There are some bright kids that have ALREADY hacked into vehicles, via their cellular connection (OnStar), and messed with brakes, and other things. This isn't even 10 or 20 years away, this has already happened. They compiled a list of all the hackable cars that THEY know about. They had the journalist drive the car, around a parking lot. The hackers used their laptop to use the vehicles OnStar (or some similar system I forgot the name) cellular connection to fuck with stuff. And the journalist basically lost control. It was a limited hack. The hacker could ""ONLY"" apply the brakes, or turn off the ignition. Now, in this case, the hacked was right there in the parking lot. But he wasn't using wifi, or Bluetooth. He did this over the cellular connection. He could've been in another country, or down the block. The other hacker on the team explained how they hacked into some system, that has basically all the GSM/Sim card (techno stuff I didn't know) for the OnStar packages. And once they had IMEI's and all that, they could do all this hacking. No special mods to the vehicle either. Scary and fascinating stuff!

Many cars now have gps. Think of the scary scenarios...hack into the car, drive it somewhere remote...kill the occupants, basically bad shit. If it was hacked to get all these IMEI's, what could you do with a slaved network? A slave network just wreaking havoc on all theses networked vehicles. 

You say it's easy, just don't network them, but they're already well into network integration. 

Tesla's Elon Musk is preparing to take one of their cars cross country as a demonstration - fully automatic... (Aside from battery charging, I presume?) A car that is connected to GPS, and can drive itself is a weapon, basically if it's hacked. Think of the recent headlines of a car that was driven by a lunatic in Vegas, driver accelerated, and plowed over a bunch of pedestrians on the Vegas strip. 

Anywho, sorry to be long winded, but I'm not bullshitting or trolling. I may have gotten the service brand mixed up (OnStar?), but many cars that have hot spots basically have a cellular SIM card in them already. But all systems are different, and evolving. Maybe Toyotas cellular system is never connected to the cars electronic computer, and only the entertainment system. The list they made differentiated which automobiles are vulnerable. In fact, I believe it was a Jeep...and after the story ran, Jeep pushed out a software update. And owners had to download it to USB, and plug that into their cars blah blah blah...

275,RocketGrouch,"Self-driving cars have a tons of problems left to solve, but being self-driving the concept of parking should just go away. 

You just get out of the car wherever you're going and the car goes and hides in some underground hole where it doesn't pollute the landscape with its ugly or its need for space. 

When you need it, you just call for it using your cell phone for instance, and it comes to pick you up.

This would be one of the major benefits, getting cars away from being a feature in our cities. These days we dedicate enormous amounts of space just to warehouse cars 23 hours out of every 24.

Of course, if we're smart, we won't proceed with self-driving cars, but instead build self-driving PRT that travels on an elevated guideway. That way, we can reserve all the space on the ground level for pedestrians and cyclists and tiny electric buggies for shorter hops.

276,heckruler,"&gt;what could someone study or train for to become the person who designs/builds/maintains those automated systems?

&gt;Design

Robotics, Electrical/Computer/Software Engineering, ComSci. There's a lot of sides to this and a crazy amount of specialization. Software covers all the thinking parts, and there's a really hot sub-field of self-learning right now. Remember, all the things that computers do in a company used to be performed by people. Those jobs got automated. Email killed the clerk. All that software has to run on computer hardware, which is getting better all the time. And Robotics covers the moving parts, but has a massive overlap with the software end to get the parts to move like you want.

&gt;Build

Sorry bub, manufacturing has been largely automated. You could try to be a technician if you wanted to run the machines in the factories.

&gt;Maintain

I.T. sysadmins are looking like yesterday's factory workers. But they keep all the backend computers up and running. The good news is that there's advancement; maintain a bigger/more critical system and they pay you more. Network engineering is hella complicated and it doesn't look like it's going away.   And a few technicians oil the robots, I guess.

&gt;""Instrumentation &amp; control automation. Study PLCs. Network communications would also be beneficial to know.""

Yep. That'd be the factory robotics sort of stuff. If you look at PLCs, stay the hell away from ladder logic, which is thankfully dying out.  Like most industries there's a sliding scale of prestige. Some people are just grunts that plug in the PLCs and hit go. A lot customize and maintain the PLCs to do whatever it is they need done on the factory floor (self-learning could foreseeably make this part go away soon). And a few work at Siemens and such who develop the PLCs and robotics they control.

&gt;What schools and universities are already prepared for teaching how to design/build automated systems?

. . . Most schools have a com-sci department or engineering colleges. If you want to aim lower, look for a tech school that offers certs in a companies systems. Something like [this](http://w3.siemens.com/mcms/sce/en/pages/default.aspx)

&gt;Which companies will become top dog in automated systems manufacturing?

Those who make systems that are automated or those who automate manufacturing systems or those who make the parts that go into automation? 

Because Siemens, Honeywell, Rockwell, ...uh, there are other big names I know I'm missing... those are all dominant players already in the field of automating factories. There are already ""top dogs"". Even prior to the boom-times of early 2000's. Everyone who makes anything SCADA which is creeping into the ""Internet of Things"" field could be new players though. Even like.... whoever makes those cheap-ass X-10 cameras. And if someone polished the hell out of it, they could probably be some serious competition if they just took a bunch of arduinos and old phones and home-brewed a cheap alternative.

The field of making automated systems in general is more open. Self-driving cars, for example, are brand-spanking new. My money is on Google.   Then there's ""Baxter"", which purports to be a general-purpose robot, which would be really neat if it caught on.

&gt;What do you think the job outlook will be like for automated systems design and manufacturing?

It looks great. And there's a ton of lateral options if one industry up and dies. Be prepared to always be learning something.

&gt;Will automated design and manufacturing be replaced by automated systems? (simple self-replication)

ok there, be careful. There's a difference between ""automated systems design"" and ""automated design"". You can't just take these words and toss them together. I'd say automated design is still in it's infacy and it's more like they're developing tools to help the designers.  

So far, self-replication is only at that ""cute"" level, and doesn't really impact manufacturing, automated systems, automated design, the act of automating an industry, or threaten any jobs.

&gt;Are you already currently preparing for this industry? If so, what are your goals?

I'm an embedded software engineer. My goal is to get paid and have a career I can use to go get paid elsewhere if needed. 10 years in, looks pretty good. Friend of mine went into Hadoop which turned into machine-learning for the medical industry identifying fraud and no-joke actually diagnosing people. That lucky fucker gets to telecommute.

277,akhotsharks454,"They do have drawbacks. But in an urban setting, if transport systems were built around public modes of transportation than there would be more stops/stations, less traffic, more frequent stops, and ultimately lower costs. This isn't to mention the greater energy and mineral resource efficiency. I'm not saying there is no place for self-driving cars, especially if a public sharing model is used, but there are simpler and more efficient ways to travel in urban areas than any kind of car. 

Unless you abolish all forms of lobbying or other private-public relationships, and the entire marketing/advertisement sector, then effectiveness/practicality will never = popularity. ",1458851339,d1c87kd,t1_d1c52wt,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016
278,FrugalHedonist,"I'll concede that a bus is more efficient than a car in one way - transportation density per unit of energy. On a societal scale a bus reduces the amount of cars on the road and reduces the pollution by reducing the amount of engines running in town. 

On a personal level on the other hand a bus is an inconvenience - like I said it doesn't run on your schedule, it doesn't go from your front door to the spot you want to go, and of course the general discomfort of being on a bus - public transport isn't typically that pretty, with a colourful cast of passengers and the lowest standard possible to save on costs. 

If a public sharing model is used then a self-driving car would be far more simple and efficient than a bus however. You'd order a car with a few taps on your phone, get in, it would take you where you were going and you'd get out. No need to pay the fare since that's done through the app or by a subscription. No need to wait in line to get on or off. No need to find a seat. No need to keep an eye open to know where you have to get off. No need to even know where you're going, or what line to use. It's all taken care of. 

And in difference of a bus a self-driving car would very rarely be empty for long. They would quickly be able to tell the usage patterns in any given location and park in a location so they have the least amount of distance to go to their next likely call. A bus on the other hand has to go mostly empty at odd hours of the day, or more likely the entire route will be cancelled for lack of paying customers. That will never be an issue with self driving cars. 

Buses might have a limited use in densely populated cities during rush hour, to keep traffic down, but even that shouldn't be much of a problem in a reality where all the cars are self-driving. Traffic will never stop when the cars just weave between each other in each intersection without pause - they will know exactly the speed they need to keep to make it between two passing cars in the other direction meaning no more red lights ever - just mild slowdowns. Traffic jams will pretty much stop happening since accidents will be way more rare and traffic all over will be dynamically rerouted far before they get stuck in slowdowns. 

So yeah, I concede that TODAY buses and trains are in theory more efficient transports in urban areas, and it's a shame they aren't prioritized more in the transport spending... but outside of major cities buses are nowhere near as convenient as having a car, and when driverless cars arrive buses will most likely be entirely replaced.

Difficult to say. I suppose it depends on how stubborn humans turn out to be and which direction technology takes. If somebody invents a Star Trek style matter replicator tomorrow, all bets are off.

Unfortunately, I suspect that the next 5 years are probably not going to be very different.  VR will arrive, delivery drones will exist but will still be rare, self driving vehicles will exist but probably only in a select few cities...these things will exist, people will know about then, but I don't think they'll have changed society yet.

5-10 years, I'm guessing things are going to start to get _weird_, as it becomes increasingly obvious that the future is not going to be like the past. There'll probably be tremendous cultural resistance, and a lot of eople completely unable to cope with the day to day reality around them. You'll probably have some few countries who've successfully implemented some sort of functional UBI-type perpetual welfare state. You'll have people living their lives in VR. You'll have people having lifelong romantic relationships with AIs. You'll have people who've found niches that allow them to live and eat and function in society in ways that are utterly baffling to people today. Like trying to explain to somebody in the 80s that there are people who make their living making silly videos on youtube. And you'll have people, and even many countries looking at all of this and decrying it as horrible and morally bankrupt, while still clinging to the idea that their values and worldviews might still have validity. And because of that, traditional methods and ways of thinking will still exist. 

Within 10-20 years, I think we'll be so well and truly far down the rabbit hole that it's difficult to even say what things will be like. And the people who can't adapt are probably going to have a difficult time.

Basic income is an entirely valid way of getting to that ""no money"" endgame, but it's not the only way. Even today, we still have people chanting the mantra that there's no such thing as a free lunch, and yet many of the people saying this are connecting over free wifi to this free reddit service that they signed up for using a free email account that they found via a free google search...and yet somehow they _don't realize_ that society is moving in a direction where goods and services can be exchanged without money trading hands.

290,How_Many_More_Times,"Thanks, kinda used your original comment to speak my mind for both expression and introspection of what I believe. I should clarify, I don't think AGI will occur in the 2020s, instead there will be a altered concept of what ANI can be simply because machine learning will eventually allow adaptability. Just as you said there will be soft ANI that is set to particular tasks and won't go beyond it (alphago) , but as our ability to create new algorithms that mimic our natural abilities to adapt, *strong* ANI will start to take the stage. A machine that simply needs to be told once how to perform a task, then it does it perfectly forever. Combine this with the eventual breakthroughs in natural language processing and robotics and you basically have a self fulfilling prophecy of machines readily available to take work away from humans by 2030 at the very latest.  
  
Consciousness will still have a lot of work by then. I compare AGI arriving in the 2020s to the wright brothers trying to land on the moon before they even made the airplane. Basically it would be a freak event, that would most likely end in disaster. However, it only took 63 years to go from flying the length of a football field to landing on the moon. We live in much faster times now than back then, so who knows what the true timeline is.  
  
Part of what defines the singularity is its ability to blur the lines of what's possible in the near future. The rate of technological advancement is so quick that breakthroughs begin to happen yearly, then eventually monthly. Kinda sounds familiar right? If I ask you what the world will look like in 5 years I'm sure you have an idea, based on what you've read, certain technologies market bound, and more, but there is a level uncertainty because of how fast our progression is now. 5 years ago, talking about the government needing to push for self driving cars would seem ridiculous. But we're here, and it's happening. What will we be pushing for 5 years from now? I believe the vast reach of the event horizon has already been crossed, and our speed towards the singularity will only speed up from here. The fact that most experts in their respective fields decline to make predictions outside of 5 years seems to prove our inability to conceptualize whats to come already. Of course there are a multitude of other factors such as politics, environmental concerns, and just human stupidity/arrogance/ignorance that could slide the scale either way. However, technological process doesn't seem to care about our petty human problems. You can see this by looking at the exponential trends not slowing at all through the cold war, the 80s oil crisis, the 2008 housing crisis, or the 2009 credit crunch. I could talk about these things for hours, and yet it seems like I'm in a minority, which is even more terrifying because blissful ignorance allows an unmitigated acceleration of progress without asking important questions. This has been the case historically speaking with the financial sector, the health sector, and it is already the case with the technological sectors.  
  
Sorry for the added ramblings, just feels good to ""air them out"". Since you've been willing to listen to me I'll give you some advice.

It won't stay that cheap for long. The other option is looking into Canadian citizenship, which may be the best option due to Canada holding a majority of earths fresh water. Also, be an ambassador for transhumanism. Tell people why we should see it as a good thing and not to fear it. If humanity has a future in 100 years, it'll be recorded from the stars. Altering culture to better humanity is tough, but it has happened before and needs to happen again, and again. Do not fear what is inevitable, instead think optimistically.

But before that technology fully matures they may make more sense? However yes they use more land (often leading to eminent domain issues and the like) and have a higher construction cost. However the city saves some costs back in reduced operation costs by not having signal lights and the equipment and maintenance required to run that system.

And yes Carmel isn't 100% roundabouts but where they've owned the whole roundabout concept like Keystone Parkway and now the nearly completed US-31 interchanges and the out-flowing side streets it's really grand.

Yes roundabouts mixed with lights can cause problems for both. For example at 116th and 31 in Carmel BEFORE the roundabout under 31 was completed and it still had lights caused the preceeding roundabouts to back up pretty bad. Now that it all free flows onto 31 I've yet to see traffic stop except for some of the ongoing construction. Side streets would back up for 1/4 mile just to get on to 31 when it had lights at rush hour. Now it moves tremendously better.

And someone was saying that Carmel sucks and hates the roundabouts. Well I only work in Carmel. I commute from south of Indianapolis...I was a Trojan not a Greyhound (if you know what that means you know). And I say four way stops suck. Once you use them all the time and get used to how to yield and not having to stop at every damn intersection and watch as people can't figure out their turn or sit in a ridiculous backup during rush hour...it's a game changer. Pretty much you hardly ever sit waiting for an option to yield enter a roundabout as long as you'd wait at a stop sign or especially through the cycles of a four lane intersection with turn cycles...especially in heavy traffic.",1459196087,d1grjx6,t3_4cbfqj,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016

302,mywan,"&gt;To achieve such futuristic efficiency, Ratti says, cities will need just a few technological ingredients: self-driving cars, of course, which seem to be well on their way, plus a good internet connection to synch data from each car. Thomas Van Woensel, a professor of freight transport and logistics at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, thinks there may be other technological hurdles to work out. In particular, he imagines there will need to be some central system that organizes overall traffic flows, like air-traffic control for the roads.

So all of this depends on the assumption that the necessary tech is universally adopted by all cars. Even with a phenomenally rapid growth of self driving cars the notion of weeding out the edge cases in the foreseeable future is not particularly reasonable. 

I think a better, shorter term, solution would be to place camera systems, similar to what's used on google cars, and use a simpler AI version to minimize stops and wait times with standard lights. No more waiting forever at a light with no other traffic, or not even having to stop to begin with. During congested times the more congested lanes can favored in real time, doing away with that one lane that temporarily doesn't have enough overflow for the people wanting that lane. Cause traffic jams in other lanes as they block them for their turn to get in the congested lane.

This may not push efficiency to the extremes suggested in the article. But the technical feat is far simpler than what's required for the self driving car itself. It can also safely fallback on a predefined timer in the event of technical issues. It would still add orders of magnitude more efficiency than the standard road sensors, which often don't even read motorbikes and such, allows human navigation and error, and seamlessly integrate into the standard system.",1459208872,d1h0iwe,t1_d1gs085,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016

A lot will depend on insurance companies, if car manufacturers are able to convince law makers to let them issue a default insurance policy on their self driving cars with lower rates (but very high deductibles if accident occurs while under manual control for example).

I do not think that every car on the road will be self driving in your life time, not because of a lack of technology, but rather because of infrastructure (lags way behind software), cost, people's preference, foreign/rental drivers, and unique driving conditions.

You have to remember you have fog, snowstorms, nighttime, ice, water, unmarked roads, driving/backing up with a trailer/hitch/wagon/big load, etc that still have to be solved, even before infrastructure and cost issues. You have weird situations in a city, like when a bus has to make a wide turn that takes them into the oncoming traffic lane, so cars have to back up to give them space, or a local bike race is going on and a police officer is rerouting traffic, or there is a car accident in an intersection and cars have to honk and work out how to navigate with each other, etc etc etc. Lot's of odd little situations that come up once a year, but have to be accounted for and systematically designed for before truly ""automatic"" cars work. You have that jerk who puts up a cutout ""pedestrian"" at a crosswalk  that forces any self driving car to stop and get a manual prompt to ignore. None of these issues are remotely insurmountable, but collectively it is years of work left to do. Mostly it is probably going to be highway driving + generic ideal conditions that you leave to the car, and you take the wheel for the weird stuff, so you still need a licence. 

Automatic transmission for example has been around for decades, and yet people still choose standard for aesthetic and enjoyment reasons, because it saves them thousands of dollars, and for comfort. I'd expect that even once the technology exists, self driving cars will be an extra option for a long while rather than the standard. ",1459222719,d1h9nd6,t3_4cdfgj,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016

Loss of jobs for Taxi drivers, trucks etc sure, quite obvious. What about other know on effects though. Insurance companies will need to massively downsize their insurance divisions. Cars will be covered by car companies and claims will be minimal. Insuring freight will cost less and be less complex since trucks will not be sitting around in a truck stop over night. 

Car bodywork shops will be hard to come by, reduction in little scrapes will be huge. If Uber style transport becomes the most common form of transport, then companies that provide such services will have their own in house mechanics and body workers.

With Uber style transport, most car showrooms will disappear and so will second hand sales and auction houses. Car shows will become drastically reduced and infrequent. Even car manufacturers will work differently and focus more on spec than style due to different type of customer.

Road sign makers will be gone as will people making traffic lights. White lines may even disappear. Even GPS will become largely integrated into the car and the need for it as an extra will be gone. Car washes and auto stores will be part of an Uber system. 

Truck stops will no longer be required and motels will be a thing of the past. Radio road reports, their helicopters and those that maintain them will be gone.

Current self driving car technology is very marginal. Google's cars depend on insanely detailed maps of the San Francisco area that Google has built and keeps, but that's not a practical approach for general self driving cars worldwide, which is what you need for any meaningful  ""take over"".

Major cities and the highways that interconnect them will have self driving cars, but those are the areas where car ownership is lowest and keeping the challenges minimized is practical. However.

The question was about SD taking over. To me that means the marginalization or outright elimination of non-SD cars. E.g. flat screens have taken over computer displays - you can buy a CRT but it isn't easy and you'll pay a premium. But with current SD technology, the people who most depend on cars can't use self drive. That puts an outright cap on adoption. With current tech S.D will NEVER take over, because it doesn't work for most of the people who actually need cars.

I agree that 50% of trips are probably within reach of current tech, if the required detailed maps are created and maintained. That is a huge and expensive undertaking. But I also agree that 50% of trips could divert to public transportation or be conducted without a vehicle using existing infrastructure. Frankly, some people drive from one side of a parking lot to the other rather than walk it and that counts as a trip.

You can demonstrate that automatic transmissions have taken over the US car market by counting how many US driver's can't drive stick shift. But today's ""self driving"" tech is such that drivers still need both a licence and the skills to drive a car, because self drive doesn't work in all conditions. 

I see a reduction in commercial licences and especially cab driver licences/medallions, but I just don't see self driving cars ""taking over"". Remember, in the 1960s, with fresh images of man walking on the moon still fading from TV sets, people thought that by the 1990s you'd be able to buy a commercial flight to the moon. Fresh technology ALWAYS makes people think greatness is just around the corner. But actually deploying that technology in such a way that it can be said to have replaced the old? Much harder.

No car would need to report their positions any more than regular cars report their positions to googles self driving car. The cameras are essentially the same but only has to deal with the exact same intersection and terrain day in and day out. Hence far fewer unknowns.

&gt;If this technology was possible and self-driving cars was the only thing we needed to do it, then we would already be doing it with air traffic control.

Airplanes in 3D space with 3D travel corridors are not even in the same category as cars on a 2D surface traveling on 1D travel corridors. The development of the air traffic tech requires real world testing, and in the highly regulated air traffic domain this is simply not feasible. Even if it was it would require strict coordination with the FAA, which could take years even after the tech is fully developed.

In March 2004 Darpas' grand challenge for autonomous vehicles to get across 142 miles of dessert every car failed miserably. But because of those failures the problems solution became history before that same year was out. Now we are still working out the kinks and edge cases for driving on roads with other human driven cars. To say that if self driving car tech was all that was needed we would be doing it it air traffic is a non sequitur. 

The traffic controller isn't required to navigate the the intersection or dodge any obstacles etc. It merely has to decide whether to keep a red or green light the same for a few more seconds or change it sooner based on the same information about traffic condition self driving cars are required to see around them. The fact that the environment is constant, always at the same intersection, massively simplifies it. Made even simpler because even if you assume separate lights for every turn lane their are only 8 choices per light cycle, 12 if you there is no right turn on red. It's at least as simple as the AI required to play space invaders, which itself requires no network connection.

Everyone is dreaming of being drunk and being driven or sleeping or reading without worries but I just dont see how that can feasibly happen.

And an even more major problem is security. I know planes have been hacked, what if my car is? What if someone hacks my car and sends me into the nearest river? What if, god forbid, these cars are connected to a network? Imagine taking over cars en masse. It would take like a dozen well placed accidents to cripple an entire city.

It's an interesting question as to how much redundancy will be built into a self driving car.   It took 50 years for dual channel brakes to become mandatory.    Are we going to wait for the technology to mature to automotive levels of lawyering, or are we going to roll with it letting the smaller percentage of machine failure vs human failure win?  How are we going to protect the multinational conglomerates when little Timmy inevitably gets plastered on the front of a semi?

Heres a scenario for a broken car. Say your driving along in you self driving car and an oncoming car blows a tire and barrels into your path. Even a machine cant stop two tons of steel on a dime. So what does it do? Does it swerve to hit other cars? Or take the impact and hope for the best? What if that vehicle is a school bus? Will that car know its a school bus and make a decision to save the kids over my life? Or what if I have my wife and kids in the car?

384,FuckYouAssholeMan,"&gt;Google cars drove for well over a million miles with only 17 accidents, all of which were human error with the exception of the most recent one

This sounds like a lot until you compare it to the miles driven every year by all the cars in America alone. Its hundreds of millions of miles. To say that the google car encountered every situation that one can encounter while driving is just wrong. It drove only 1 million and found one area where it fucked up. 

But what about things that need human attention. What happens when something goes wrong? What happens when there is a accident? What will the machine do? What is its primary objective? Is it to obey traffic laws? Is it to avoid accidents? Is it to protect human life? Because sometime you have to break those to do others. Sometimes you have to break traffic laws to avoid an accident and cause an accident to save a life. So what will the car do? Will it know enough to run a stop sign if the driver is in danger of being carjacked?

Also lets talk about human lives because I am *very* concerned about those. Say your driving along in you self driving car and an oncoming car blows a tire and barrels into your path.

385,FuckYouAssholeMan,"Very. Ive said this before but I dont think autonomous cars will exist in the next century. At least not in the sense you are thinking. Tesla assist will certainly become the standard and will prevent thousand and thousands of accidents. But a driver will always need to be behind the wheel. The idea of being drunk or sleeping or reading etc while the car drives you is a fantasy. There are concerns that *nobody* is talking about. 

So the autonomous vehicle will be driving by itself right? Will it have a steering wheel? I want to be able to take manual control of my car at any time for any reason, immediately without question. Thats what I need in order to drive one. The reason for this is that I dont believe a machine can handle every scenario that driving entails. But I will explain that further down.
Also, are we ready to put that much faith in a machine? Its obvious that the transition period will be long and autonomous cars will share the road, probably forever. Because some people will hate the idea, some will protest, and others just simply like driving and like cars, its a hobby. Plus motorcyclists. So they will share the road and you dont have the authority to control peoples lives at that level in this country. We arent a totalitarian society.

Maybe its my estranged step-brother and Id rather save my life over his. Does the machine make these decisions?

Also theres the issue of traffic. Ive heard these cars drive like pussies. Basically they are defensive. So if I see a self driving car I know that I will be able to cut if off every single time because it will let me. I also know that my commute will be slower because generally people drive past the speed limit on the highway. But will these cars keep up with traffic no matter what? What if its them who sets the pace? Have you ever been on the highway when everyone goes 65? No because otherwise it would be a traffic jam. Not to mention all the scenarios there are in driving. Theres no way a computer will be able to know what to do in literally every scenario. Car jackings aside, will it stop for every obstacle in the road? Will it know to stop for a cat and not a squirrel? Sorry but I dont want my car stopping for every squirrel in the road. People say 'well they do it for planes'. Planes are easy. Theres nothing in the sky to get in your way. Driving on the ground, on roads increases the number of variables exponentially.

389,FuckYouAssholeMan,"Ok pal youre throwing things aside that cannot be dismissed so easily. 

You think that because a google car handled a wheelchair and a duck then they can handle *any* obstacle in the road? That is just plain silly. 

&gt;  Getting robbed also shouldn't be much of a problem as criminals would soon find out it's really stupid to commit a crime next to a machine so full of sensors. Identifying the perp and proving the crime would be trivial.

Im sorry but what kind of sensors can see through a mask? Are you going to tell me these cars have facial recognition technology? Wait...are you saying these cars are going to be connected to the internet??? I was under the assumption they were passively read the road as they drove and react. Like how google has a sensor on their cars. Needing an internet connection opens a whole new world of things like hacking. I know cars have been hacked before. Even planes. What if someone hacks my car and rolls up my windows and drives me into the nearest river? Your simple solution opens a pandoras box of security concerns.

&gt; The machine won't always make the optimal choice, that's impossible without having a huge amount of information that neither machines or humans have. But it is likely to make, on average, better choices than humans. Even if it didn't and ocassionally rammed a school bus to avoid colliding with a single-passenger car, those few schoolbuses wouldn't make a dent in the many millions of lives saved by replacing human drivers with machines.

This is the answer of a coldhearted and/or naive person. If you had people you cared about you would know this answer would not be acceptable. You say human life, thats easy. But *which* human life is the question? Because car accidents are some of the most mathematically unpredictable things out there. The machine wont know which people will survive or die before the crash happens. So I bring you again to my moral dilemma:

Will the car protect the driver above all else? Will it protect me over the schoolbus full of children or will it put me in danger to save the children. Will it put me in any danger at all at any point? Will it swerve off the road aggressively if need be to avoid hitting a person on a snowy road? Will it risk sending me down an embankment? Because I dont want that. Ever. Call me a selfish asshole but Id rather them than me. I dont want my car turning against me. You cant just dismiss this argument because it may not be the most legitimate, it will be the most debated. Imagine the headline ""machine sacrifices driver to save child on road"". *That* is something people will be scared of.  I just need to know I am the number one priority when my car is driving me around. Unless Im not. I want it to know that when my wife and kids are in the car then they are prioritized before me. 

So in the situation if I find a car coming at me head on, I want my car to know whether to swerve to the right or left. To let the passenger or drivers side have the chance of taking the impact. Because it will have the time to make *some* decision. If not to prevent the accident then to make it better for *someone* in that car. Thats what I need to know. 

You know why? Because that is something *everyone* can understand. Yes hacking and litigation are threats, but not everyone understands them. You tell people your car my kill you? (yes even though driving is already so dangerous) Then that will kill self driving cars.

&gt; What I am saying is that there are major logistical, moral, ethical, legal, and security concerns that nobody is talking about.

*Nobody*. And that was me cheerfully glazing over your hearsay and wild speculation. ""I heard they drive like pussies."" Good start to an argument.

To answer your concerns, most technologies go through a period of skepticism, then adoption, then normalization. Will most models have a steering wheel and a manual mode? Of course they will, until the technology gains trust in the mainstream. ""You want"" to be able to take control, but there are others who want their car to be able to drive 200mph. What ""you want"" doesn't really apply here when we're talking about high speed guided explosives with seatbelts. Moral decisions can be handled the exact way people handle them; you don't have time to make those kinds of decisions, you just look for an empty space for your car to go into instead of a space filled with another car/person/building/whatever.

&gt; Also theres the issue of traffic. Ive heard these cars drive like pussies. Basically they are defensive.

Oh god no, not drivers that drive like we were all taught to drive instead of irresponsible selfish assholes like we all actually drive. Do you frequently cut off old ladies because you know they're going to drive defensively?

&gt; Sorry but I dont want my car stopping for every squirrel in the road.

And some people, I'd warrant most people, actually do want the squirrel to be saved. Also because the car has considerably better reflexes than you, it could probably quite easily slightly adjust course to avoid contact, vs. a kneejerk reaction of slamming on the brakes or swerving into the ditch, the way most people react.

If I come off as rude or condescending, it's because you a: called out everyone for just blindly wanting these cars on the road today without considering any of your very valid concerns, despite not having checked if anyone had discussed your concerns, and b: assuming that the very intelligent people designing and creating these cars, as well as the researchers and legislators involved in bringing it to legal reality are all much more stupid than your armchair-commenting self, and have overlooked your very salient points as if they don't exist.

392,ferlessleedr,"This couldn't be implemented for years, perhaps decades.  It could only be on streets *only* traversed by autonomous cars, and you would need the cars to communicate with either each other on a common language or all communicate to a central control system.

The first thing isn't happening for a LONG time.  We're not going to just massively shift technologies all in one day as a society, it'll be a gradual adoption.  There'll be self-driving cabs here and there, a few wealthy people owning self-driving vehicles, then the feature will become more and more widely available until it's mandated standard on all cars as a safety feature like seatbelts.  Then, it'll take 10-20 years for all of the used cars to get off the streets (and you'll still have classics that don't conform and the owners will be EXTREMELY unwilling to massively overhaul to add upgrades).

Regarding the second thing, it's doable through industry regulation but it would require huge amounts of R&amp;D on somebody's part and somebody would have to maintain and secure the infrastructure.  Imagine if someone got into the timing control of the central server, or if there was a simple terror attack on the data center hosting that service!  It could be catastrophic.

I have a far simpler idea: Scrap this stupid plan where an insane number of things can go wrong and install roundabouts.  Those are safer by far for human drivers as well, and also help to diminish traffic jams.

There are a few things hackers were able to do due to a few vulnerabilities that have been since patched. Hopefully, auto manufactures will take IT security more seriously. A Google car being hacked would be rather interesting, but patched within days thanks to that wonderful Internet connection.

&gt;Even planes. 

~~As far as I know, no plane has ever been ""hacked"".~~ We can spoof signals of planes, jam them, and manipulate them, but as far as I know, without physical access to the console, they can't be hacked remotely. It seems that the system was poorly designed. Check ""edit:""

Man, you should stop using your computer / phone / literally all technology right now. Everything's technically vulnerable. There is no ""unhackable"" system.

&gt;The machine wont know which people will survive or die before the crash happens.

Neither will a person. The machine might have way more information regarding the incident.

&gt;You cant just dismiss this argument because it may not be the most legitimate, it will be the most debated. 

We can dismiss this argument as it hasn't happened yet. Protocols haven't been designed. As a user of the car, the choice will probably be up to you. If you don't have the choice in the current model, guess what? No one is forcing you to buy a self-driving car. If you really want a choice, you can go build your own with blackjack and hookers.

&gt;I just need to know I am the number one priority when my car is driving me around

Sweet, hack your own car, and change the code. Jailbreaking is legal, you're free to do that as a private citizen.

&gt;So in the situation if I find a car coming at me head on, I want my car to know whether to swerve to the right or left. 

Ideally, if the other car is self-driving and connected to the Internet, a third-party provider has already given your car a solution to the problem before it even comes close to you.

Then again, if another car wants to ram you, they will, so your argument can be safely dismissed.

&gt;Then that will kill self driving cars.

Cars don't kill people, people kill people. Most of your cases set events happening that were caused by a human. Self-driving cars won't lose control in any environment as it is known information to them.

Currently, self-driving cars do not drive in environments that they are not prepared for. So, it's fairly safe to assume that a self-driving car will be prepared for that patch of ice if it is driving in that environment, it will be prepared to maintain control.

The self-driving car won't be the cause of the crash, it'll be the human on the other side that didn't prepare for the ice, that slammed the brakes and spun out rather than trying to maintain control.

------

I'd love to see self-driving cars become the norm. The data they can obtain would be absolutely amazing to have and could revolutionize the world. Think, if a self-driving car detects a pothole, it instantly informs the local govt of it. Now that pothole can be repaired without someone even having to make a call.

Self-driving cars that talk to each other via a 3rd party service would be neat. Just think, if a car in front of you is heading to the same location, you draft off each other. If the car in front of you is going to turn in a couple miles, you slow down 1 MPH to account for it turning, which prevents you from having to slow down more than that.

Even more so, with a open standard, you'll be able to accurately predict your route down to the second of arrival. Sure, you'll have other events that may throw the time off, but how often does a deer delay your trip to work in the morning?

Yes and my phone can be hacked. However my phone wont crash me into a wall or drive me into a river. How can you be so dismissive of this? Do you not fully understand the implications?

&gt; There are a few things hackers were able to do due to a few vulnerabilities that have been since patched. Hopefully, auto manufactures will take IT security more seriously. A Google car being hacked would be rather interesting, but patched within days thanks to that wonderful Internet connection.

This is the statement of someone who is completely ignorant of what hacking and encryption entails. It is fluid. Both are constantly evolving. Days are irrelevant when it takes seconds to exploit a vulnerability. 

&gt; And another driver on the road could crash into you at 100 MPH. What are you to do?

Now I feel as though you are soft in the head. You cant just dismiss the legitimate concern of hacking with: ""oh well some douche could crash into you now so it doesnt matter"". Its obvious that the transition period will be long and autonomous cars will share the road, probably forever. Because some people will hate the idea, some will protest, and others just simply like driving and like cars, its a hobby. Plus motorcyclists.

I know wire tapping laws in my state. Technically, your phone is always listening if you have Siri or have Google's voice activated. Now, I'm assuming a car would be ""listening"" to the environment (think car honks). It'd be weird not to implement some sort of environment level processing into a self-driving car of the future.

&gt;Internet connection. Bad.

Silly users. You do know just about everything is connected to the Internet, right? Most the United State's infrastructure is tied almost directly to the Internet.

&gt;Yes and my phone can be hacked. However my phone wont crash me into a wall or drive me into a river. How can you be so dismissive of this? Do you not fully understand the implications?

GPS on your phone can lead you to a dangerous place. Of course, it can always explode considering the lithium-ion battery. I'm fairly sure with the right code, you could cause the phone to overheat and not shutdown properly and bam! Exploding phones in your pocket.

This of course is assuming that your phone can be easily rooted and gives absolutely full control to the hacker. Of course hacking doesn't work like this as it'd require multiple zero-day vulnerabilities to gain that level of access.

&gt;This is the statement of someone who is completely ignorant of what hacking and encryption entails.

Erm, what qualifications do you have in the field of security? I'm actually certified by 

&gt; It is fluid. Both are constantly evolving. Days are irrelevant when it takes seconds to exploit a vulnerability.

PoC != in the wild. Google's bug bounty program will be worth it for a hacker to come forward... that's assuming they can find a vulnerability without physical access, which would be kinda neat.

&gt;You cant just dismiss the legitimate concern of hacking

There is no legitimate concern of hacking without physical access. Go on, hack my computer right now. See? You can't. Hack my phone. Nope, still can't do that. You don't seem to understand that most of ""hacking"" now-a-days is social engineering. It's way easier to gain access that way than trying to exploit some random code.

&gt;So they will share the road and you dont have the authority to control peoples lives at that level in this country. We arent a totalitarian society.

Never said I was taking away civil liberties. Please don't try to shove words into my mouth.

&gt;Again, you are being naive, condensing, ignorant, and childish. 

Erm, take a look in the mirror.

&gt;None of the objects can kill me if hacked. A car can. That is the difference. How are you not getting this?

Yes, they all can kill you. With -1RING access (take a look at Intel vPro) and some custom firmware, I could do some major damage with any of those items.

&gt;Oh yes. Please use this as the autonomous car selling point. ""Dont worry we havent thought of this yet. It will be okay!"".lol

The reason I've dismissed the point is because you're putting words into manufactures mouths. You can't predict the protocol the car manufacture will use. Until you read the code yourself, you will never know. You're just making assumptions out of your ass at that point.

&gt; Im not actually going to reply to you any further since you clearly know nothing about what you are talking about.

My qualifications on this subject are pretty decent. Mostly sec/net focused, but nothing in the auto-industry.

What are your qualifications on this matter? Please elaborate.

Overall, we'll probably have to agree to disagree. Just because something is possible, doesn't mean it's probable. The probability of a car being hacked for malicious purpose is near nil.

Some new technologies expand rapidly.  Others don't.  The aeroplane, the car, the train, the canal boat: these all took over fast.  Supersonic aircraft, the bicycle, the segway, and spacecraft didn't.  What puts some things in the first category and others in the second?

&gt; To achieve such futuristic efficiency, Ratti says, cities will need just a few technological ingredients: self-driving cars, of course, which seem to be well on their way, plus a good internet connection to synch data from each car.

The actual list of prerequisites will be at least a page long. From pedestrians, from assuring no interruptions in the traffic (lest a car slams into the rear of another that failed to vacate the crossing in a timely manner due to some unexpected obstruction), car companies reaching agreement to the protocol, establishing a way that would physically (not just legally) prevent non-autonomous traffic from entering autonomous-only roads, and so on and so on.

What happens when something goes wrong? What happens when there is a accident? What will the machine do? What is its primary objective? Is it to obey traffic laws? Is it to avoid accidents? Is it to protect human life? Because sometime you have to break those to do others. Sometimes you have to break traffic laws to avoid an accident and cause an accident to save a life. So what will the car do? Will it know enough to run a stop sign if the driver is in danger of being carjacked?

Say your driving along in you self driving car and an oncoming car blows a tire and barrels into your path. Even a machine cant stop two tons of steel on a dime. So what does it do? Does it swerve to hit other cars? Or take the impact and hope for the best? What if that vehicle is a school bus? Will that car know its a school bus and make a decision to save the kids over my life? Or what if I have my wife and kids in the car? What if the car swerves in such a way that it protects the driver but sacrifices the safety of the passengers? I dont want that. Or maybe I do. Maybe its my estranged step-brother and Id rather save my life over his. Does the machine make these decisions?

Also theres the issue of traffic. Ive heard these cars drive like pussies. Basically they are defensive. So if I see a self driving car I know that I will be able to cut if off every single time because it will let me. I also know that my commute will be slower because generally people drive past the speed limit on the highway. But will these cars keep up with traffic no matter what? What if its them who sets the pace? Have you ever been on the highway when everyone goes 65? No because otherwise it would be a traffic jam. Not to mention all the scenarios there are in driving. Theres no way a computer will be able to know what to do in literally every scenario. Car jackings aside, will it stop for every obstacle in the road? Will it know to stop for a cat and not a squirrel? Sorry but I dont want my car stopping for every squirrel in the road. People say 'well they do it for planes'. Planes are easy.

I understand the premise or idea that, for example, a self-driving car that is programmed to be altruistic and patient will probably feel better to be around than the typical selfish and impatient drivers.

But, this only happens today if the developers decide to make the car behave in this way. i.e it's still very much about people.

So we might interpret this to mean ""people want trustworthy and ethical leaders"" - but this is clearly not true. Since we've had a human history full of coups, revolutions, democracies and so on and regardless of whatever system we've had in place we've rarely, if ever choosen the type of leader people are suggesting they want in a workplace leader or manager.

Ergo, something doesn't add up.

You know, during WW2 Britain didn't want a peaceful prime minister. No matter how many people might wish for world peace, bottom line if we feel threatened we want that threat met with force. When push comes to shove we don't pick a nice leader because we don't live in a nice world.

When shove comes to crunch we want the leader of our workplace to keep us in jobs and even though the nice honest, trustworthy guy sounds good on paper I think a large percentage of the workforce would see the disaster he'd create going up against the competition.

There is a line in the sand, obviously. Too unethical or dictatorial and, yes, that would be bad, but equally, no one really wants the nice guy.

Easy question to answer- There is an accident of some sort.  Those are to be expected and are baked into the cake.  But each time this occurs, the AI learns and improves. As for the offensive driver, the AI records the plate of the offensive vehicle and reports it.  The driver is fined and sooner or later, if they keep repeating the infraction, removed from the road.  The AI will learn faster than the human counterpart, inside of six months to one year all of the possible scenarios have been shared between each vehicle.  They will be able to collectively figure out the best approach to every traffic situation- except one.

413,SeanWithAnX,"&gt;Fist of all statistics do not work that way. Im sorry but they dont. You cant take google cars record and extrapolate based on a linear progression. That is just plain false. Simple algebra that is inaccurately applied to statistics wont substantiate these claims. 

You don't need my simple algebra to substantiate these claims. Here's an [article](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/self-driving-cars-could-save-300000-lives-per-decade-in-america/407956/) about what some researchers think about it.    And really, statistics, while a bit more complicated than I was prepared to do for a reddit post, do work like that. We have a sample size of at least 1.3 million miles (more since that number was reached) which equals about 100 years worth of normal driving. The average poll usually has on average only about 1,000 people in it and those numbers can, pretty accurately, determine how people feel about certain things, and that is dealing with people's thoughts and not hard numbers. So while the sample size is limited in this case (it has to be since this is so new), that doesn't change the numbers. Full disclosure, I have read [articles](http://www.gizmag.com/google-reveals-lessons-learned-from-self-driving-car-program/37481/) where the rate of accidents appear higher than average. After all the cars have been involved in 17 total accidents, but by comparison I've been involved in no less than 4 in 20 years of driving (1 my fault) so Google is thus far performing on average better than me. But again, these are all minor accidents and almost none were the cars fault.

&gt;Wrong. http://www.today.com/id/39146785/ns/today-today_news/t/husband-steers-crash-save-wife-unborn-child/

&gt;This happens all the time. You speak like a robot, which does not do you any good considering you are tying to make the case that robots have the empathy humans have. They do not. Period. 

I don't know how to say this without confirming your opinion that I am somehow without empathy, but that article doesn't say anything about what we are talking about. He swerved the car and one person died instead of three. But anyone would have swerved the car to avoid a head-on-collision. But consider this: if the car had been in control and had reacted faster, are we sure all of them couldn't have been saved? 

And let's refrain from ad hominem attacks. I am not ""speaking like a robot."" I'm looking at the issue from the point of view of the most good for everyone and I do that by leaving emotion out of the argument as much as possible, because what I feel about a situation isn't nearly as important as the facts behind the situation. I have two kids and the thought of them dying in a car crash enters my head every time I get in the car and I would gladly put a machine in charge of the menial task of driving because I know that eventually it will do a far better job than I could.

&gt;Wrong wrong wrong. You cannot make this assumption. These cars cannot be connected to the internet. Do you have any idea how vulnerable that will make them to hacking? What if a car is hacked and drives me into a river? Or what if a network of cars are hacked wreaking havoc in a city.

I never said the cars would be connected to the internet, I said the cars would be communicating with each other and that doesn't necessarily mean two way communication. A car can continuously be broadcasting it's speed and driving plan and what it is about to do like changing lanes or stopping for an animal, or whatever. There's no need to make it a hackable thing, but if that is your concern, there are cars out there right now that are hackable, but it's [not easy](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-car-hacking-is-nearly-impossible/) and it's as easy to avoid as keeping a car's control circuits separate from it's communication ones. 

&gt;A false assumption. I have made it clear that not all cars will be autonomous. Ever. Some people will hate the idea, some will protest, and others just simply like driving and like cars, its a hobby. Plus motorcyclists. So they will share the road and you dont have the authority to control peoples lives at that level in this country. We arent a totalitarian society. Let me be clear, the idea you are asserting are based on as assumption that all cars will be driverless. This is wrong. This will always be wrong. All thoughts that are based on this assumption are wrong.

Here's a potential scenario for how the future will play out. Eventually driverless cars will be approved for mass production. Companies that rely on driving things for their business will test out driverless cars. Once they prove safer and more reliable then they will start replacing all of their drivers. Every time a long-haul truckers drives off the road or causes an accident, there will be more pressure for businesses to use driverless cars. It's just better for business. There may occasionally be an accident or a fatality that cause people to question driverless cars, but eventually the number of accidents and fatalities will start to decrease. Meanwhile the first people start buying their own driverless cars. Mostly rich people because the technology is so new, but that's the way it always is. There will likely be a high profile accident that people will try to blame on the car, but it will be shown to be human error. But the cars will keep making their way on to the road and eventually you will have affordable basic models like the Corolla or the Civic. People will be skeptical, but they'll ride in one that a friend has bought. it will go perfectly and they will enjoy sitting comfortably and not having to worry about what's going on the road. So they will decide that their next car will be driverless. Eventually more driverless cars will lead to fewer accidents. And not long after there will be accidents caused by drivers killing passengers in driverless cars. Now you have an uproar. That drunk driver shouldn't have been behind the wheel. But if his car had been a driverless one that wouldn't have been an issue. But it doesn't even need to be drinking, as texting and driving (or distracted driving) is almost just as bad and getting worse. Not only will people relish the idea of getting to work while playing on their phone the whole time, every safety group in the world is going to put pressure on carmakers to start phasing out normal cars. They won't even need to make laws as carmakers, seeing the safety records of driverless cars, will just stop making the other ones. I won't even advocate for laws that prevent you from driving a car on major roads because I won't need to. It's like that person who smokes in front of the public entrance to a building...society is going to take care of that for us.

It's actually not very close, the model S has a considerably lower total chance of injury, mostly due to better side collision and side pole intrusion numbers, as well as the low center of gravity making flipping it a SOB.  This is not to say the competition also aren't quite safe, just that the S is farther from second place than the other cars are from each other.

&gt; technologically advanced

How does model S fall short of competitors on technology?  It's the only car with over the air updates, functional self driving abilities, I don't know what to call it but ""learning the drivers habits and pre-heating/loading calendars/directions etc.""  By ""functional"" on self driving, I mean to say that while I realize Mercedes, Acura, and some other brands have systems that are somewhat similar, the Tesla system out performs them by a large factor according to tests.  I can find the article if that isn't data you had seen yet.

If the other cars are more advanced I would love to be educated on those features - I have heard consistently that they are not, but I've never owned either.

&gt; Interior appointments are a huge deal for cars in the 100K+ segment. That's why the LS and the S class make the 7 series look like a bad joke in sales, even though the 7 is a lot more fun to drive.

Since the model S outsold both in the US last year, does this suggest that people find it so much better that they don't care about the interior, or something else in your opinion?

Good points on noise, possible sales slump (I'm not aware of the coming refresh), and top end accel (though I think the ludicrous Tesla's don't give up nearly as much ground there as the regular S's used to).",1459376122,d1jo7yy,t1_d1ja4wg,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016

436,tri-shield,"First, regarding safety:

Yes, in theory the Tesla Model S might be safer.  It got a great rating, but Musk's claims met with some flak from the NHTSA since their response was that they didn't differentiate between the 5 star ratings.  In other words: *Tesla* interpreted it as them being the best ever, when in reality the rating they got was that which a few other cars have achieved (five stars in all categories.)  (You need to remember to separate spin from fact here; Tesla has learned a thing or two from Apple in this department.)  

[Case in point](https://www.cars.com/articles/2013/08/tesla-model-s-safest-car-overall-not-so-fast/):

&gt; ""NHTSA does not rate vehicles beyond five stars and does not rank or order vehicles within the starred categories""

I'd love to see how it fares on the IIHS tests, but so far Tesla hasn't had them test it.

Tesla's self-driving is indeed a more advanced than some of its competitors in some ways.  A large factor might be a bit of a stretch depending on with whom you're comparing.  It's better, but it's not that far away from the others, clever name be damned. (Yes, I read the C&amp;D article too.)

But I didn't just mean that.  There's plenty of other tech that goes into a car, and it's not like being electric gives them a pass when it comes to things like body control, interior gadgets, etc.  And there I would argue the S class is the current leader (since... that's kinda the point of the S class.)  Case in point: all luxury cars now generally have adaptive suspension.  But how it behaves differs greatly from car to car.  Some of them are reactive while others are predictive.  The S class is in the latter category, the Tesla the former[1].  Both good, but one is significantly more advanced.  (And prone to stupid shit, but hey... we're not talking about what is more reliable. ;))

Or interior quality... that's kinda easy.  Sit in a Model S.  Then sit in a new S class.  Yes, most of the interior gadgetry is pointless technology for the sake of technology.  Which is why I'd never buy one new.  But it's still there.  Materials aren't really comparable.  The Model S is better than the E, but short of the S class.

Then there's the minor stuff like Crosswind Assist (which detects and compensates for crosswinds...yes, really), the sort of calendar/phone integration that you'd expect, heads-up displays, headlights that track opposing traffic and direct light away from them, windshield wipers that integrate fluid dispensers to avoid a brief reduction in visibility from the sprayers, independently controlled lighting of pedestrians and animals at night (i.e. the car finds them and spotlights them), etc.  None of it's vital or integral to the car, but it's another area where the S class has technology that few if any other cars do.

(Note: this does not mean that I *like* the S class.  I've dealt with enough of them to never want a German car again.  Just that it's the benchmark for advanced cars.)

&gt; Since the model S outsold both in the US last year, does this suggest that people find it so much better that they don't care about the interior, or something else in your opinion?

I think the Model S is now what the E class was three decades ago; a way to show you've ""made it"" and have the money to spend on a ""sophisticated"" car.  It's the current hot car, and it gets a lot of people who are buying it for the image it projects (""Yeah, I've got money, but I'm environmentally conscious and cutting edge"".)

This is pretty subjective, but here's some stuff I'm excited about this year:

**VR:** the more I learn and experience it, the more I am excited about how new this Medium actually is in reaching a level of immersion not yet seen before. So far watching videos on Oculus is my favorite because I get to more closely experience things like surfing a colossal wave that I'd not get a chance to do. Some of the exploratory new UIs we're seeing in games like Lands' End (controlling things with the power of your gaze!) are also very intriguing to me. Looking forward to a lot more innovations in how we connect and interact with friends in this space.
    
**Voice UIs:** got an Amazon Echo recently and I love it. Theoretically the idea of asking questions/issuing commands by saying them (rather than typing them/manipulating a UI by hand) is so much more efficient, but voice technology has in the past never been good enough to actually be reliable enough to use regularly. The Echo is a sign to me that that is shifting. I hope to see more data-connected Voice UIs pop up everywhere in the future. 
    
**Live Broadcasting:** another very cool new medium that feels really engaging to me because of the fact that it is live and unpredictable, and because of the opportunities for real-time, deep and engaging interactions between the broadcasters and watchers. I have been watching so much Live on Facebook in past months.
    
**Productivity tools at work:** Slack is super cool and the nice touches and integrations are well done. I use Facebook@Work 8 hours a day (the enterprise version of Facebook where all the correspondences that would traditionally have been a mailing list or long subject line are now groups). As a designer, I love that there is so much innovation on design tools. We've been investing in a lot of stuff in-house at Facebook as well on the design tools front to help designers spend more time in the creative zone and less time on the manual, repetitive stuff.
    
**3-D printers and robots:** not necessary ""internet,"" and maybe 2016 isn't quite the year these become mainstream, but I think these are the jam. This is like productivity tools at work taken to the next level, where more and more things can physically be manufactured cheaply and quickly, and more and more time and energy can be poured into the creation of blueprints/patterns.  
    
**Self-driving cars.** Just got a Tesla this year. Obsessed with the auto-driving capability.

469,Kafke,"There's a bigger picture.

Essentially they're arguing for DMCA and other restrictive copyright laws. These laws are set in place to ensure freely-reproducible products (information-based stuff, like science, text, music, movies, games, etc) are still profitable in our current economy. The reason we need these laws is because information can be freely reproduced, meaning no proof-of-work is needed. Historically, proof-of-work was grouped with the medium it was scribed to. Like CDs, cassettes, etc. With the internet, there's no PoW medium that ties along with the information. Information is *truly* free.

This means that in order to keep information products in the PoW economy (what we have now), that we *need* copyright laws to legally prevent people from copying and sharing it. That way you can still obtain credit for the PoW, even *if* there's no work being done (it's free to copy something).

The big companies are pushing for this, because it keeps things moving as they are expected. Information-products will be able to compete, and our economy will support it (provided the law is followed).

However, morality and common sense tells us it's stupid. We *want* it to be unprofitable. We *want* it to be free. Because why not? Information is freely copyable, so why not do it? It helps promote a more intelligent and creative society.

The problem is that by removing the copyright laws, it makes the information industry unprofitable. That means in our current economy, there's *no reason* to provide information-based goods. They're all free, so no profit will be made.

Look at science, for example. It's solely IP based. Historically they've sold the IP rights to journals, who then sold *physical* journals that people could read about new science info. However, science, as a field *should* be free. People should be able to freely look at the science and improve upon it. And that'd happen if we don't have IP laws. The issue, then, is that scientists can't get money and would no longer be able to support themselves.

Essentially the options are: enforce restricted reproduction of freely reproducible goods, or to bow out and say these fields are no longer profitable and should not be incentivized by our current economy.

Neither are particularly good options.

---

For the taxi driver thing, it's a different issue. Taxi driving is a *service*, not a freely reproducible good. Uber and co simply make it *easier* to enter this field. To provide such a service. This is good because it encourages competition amongst taxi services. The service is still PoW-based, so it still has inherent value (at least, until self-driving cars enter the scene).

Taxi drivers are pissed at Uber and stuff because it hurts *their* business, rather than the field itself. Uber helps the field, but by doing so, hurts the current competitors. Which is why they're pissed. Less business because business is more decentralized.

Kind of like ISPs, and how they want to prevent new startups and communally owned lines. Having more lines/startups would be good for the field, but bad for the current competitors.

The music guys are *literally* fighting to keep their *industry* alive and profitable. Which means fighting for the little guy as well. They aren't so concerned about their *own* business (support for smaller artists is increasingly popular with stuff like iTunes and Spotify). They're concerned about the longevity of the industry itself. Which ties into the larger issue of whether IP should be restricted, and thus artificially scarce and profitable. Or whether it should be how it is naturally: free and unable to support a business.",1459651475,d1noo82,t1_d1mxvn8,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016
470,Kafke,"&gt;The only thing that ""enforces"" Bitcoin is math and code running on a distributed network of voluntary users.

No, you misunderstood. I'm not talking about the *bitcoin*. I'm talking about the stuff that's *bought and sold using bitcoin*. Obviously bitcoin's ownership is enforced by the system itself. That's sort of the whole point. But you can't buy or sell anything using bitcoin without some sort of legal system that enforces it.

For example, say you want to sell me a hat. In our current legal system, I can send you a bitcoin, and you give me the hat. The hat is now mine, legally. Before I bought it, the hat was yours, legally. If someone tried to take it without giving you bitcoin, they'd be taken by force and either had to pay (by force) or they were thrown in jail (by force).

Instead, get rid of the jail/legal system/etc. None of that. Now what point is there to sending you a bitcoin to get the hat, when I can simply walk over there and take it? Bitcoin doesn't say you own the hat. And even if it did, I have no obligation to listen to it.

So in order for bitcoin to be useful, there has to be forceful ownership of things.

&gt; A country could outlaw Bitcoin and the system would still work.

Sure. But bitcoin does not and cannot enforce ownership of anything outside of bitcoin.

&gt; And, yes, it is an opt-in currency.

So you have no problems with me taking your hat without using bitcoin? Something tells me you do have a problem with that. It's not opt-in if you have to use it. If bitcoin was made the official currency, you'd *have* to use bitcoin. Just like you *have* to use the dollar.

&gt;I think the society you are envisioning is theoretically possible once we have reached some kind of ASI / technological singularity where scarcity is no longer an issue,

For 99.9999% of stuff, scarcity is not an issue. We do not need ASI, nor the singularity. What I'm advocating would work right this second. The only requirement is that people adopt the system (if there's forceful ownership the system won't work).

&gt;but as long as we live in frail, human bodies people will compete for the scarce resources.

Which resources, exactly? Personally, everything I need (and anyone needs) we have an overabundance of. Food? 1/3 is going to waste and we have plenty to feed everyone. Water? Not only do we have a ton of it, but we can also get more through various means. Electricity? Solar and Wind are already a thing, we just need wider adoption.

What else do you need to live? A livable space to sleep that's safe from the environment? We literally have ghost cities and plenty of empty buildings. We just need to say the okay to use them.

Or maybe we need communication infrastructure? Nope, we have that too. And mesh networking can easily be a thing.

Roads? Self-driving vehicles and public transportation already exist. And most of the manufacturing is automated.

And do keep in mind what I'm saying is *not* to have everyone lay around and be lazy. There's obviously some areas that still need people to participate. But given this solution, people will *willingly* participate, rather than be forced to. Simply through design.

&gt; arguments like yours always reduce down to some version of people who have more or can do more should give more of what they have/can create with their own labor to others because it's the right thing to do. 

No. None of that. There's no 'should'. There's no ""I have more than you"" or ""people with more should give"". No. No one has more, because no one has.

Then you mention ""do more"". This is also false. People who can do can easily just go off and do their own thing. Not a problem. You want to do that, go ahead. However, with no obligation, people can realize that the best solution is to make decentralized systems that support everyone, rather than make privatized personal systems that encourage waste.

There's no need to hog or be selfish, because any needs you have can and will be met. If not by others, then by yourself.

&gt;if someone chooses NOT to give their time or effort to someone else, I will never believe in using force to create this system (of what could fairly be called slavery).

The system I'm advocating lacks force by nature. What you're saying is that we should force people to work for those who have forcefully claimed ownership. I disagree with that entire premise. I don't think anyone should forcefully claim ownership and I don't think anyone should be forced to work for those who forcefully claimed ownership.

By your own admission, forceful ownership and forced trade is slavery.",1459664088,d1nu7ep,t1_d1nswhp,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016
471,Kafke,"&gt;Your understanding of IP is just not correct.

I don't see how so.

&gt;A drug company will spend $1 billion of very real dollars on very real labor and very real resources to develop a new drug.

No. A drug company will spend $1 billion of fiat currency on labor that's only there because of forcefully requiring it along with resources to obtain the right to forcefully monopolize the development of a new drug. They won't spend that money unless they have the forceful monopolistic right to it.

&gt;If they can't recoup their investment, they will stop making investments.

Indeed. They also won't invest in any productive or beneficial thing that inherently hurts the monetary system and money-based economy. Which is why we see such slow adoption rates for renewable energy. And why recycling is not really adopted. And why there's lots of barriers for electric vehicles and self-driving cars.

&gt;IP doesn't create artificial scarcity. 

It does. It enforces monopoly on freely shareable and reproducible ideas.

&gt;It just requires that you pay the people who did all the work and spent all the money producing it.

This is creating artificial scarcity.

&gt;The money and resources that go into research and development are just as real as the money and resources that go into making a car.

Sure. But research and development are intangible things. They aren't real. They're just ideas and thoughts.

&gt;But I can't walk off the car lot with a car without paying and say you are creating artificial scarcity if you don't let me.

If you can infinitely and freely reproduce cars, and you're saying you can't take a car without paying, that's creating artificial scarcity. We actually *have* such a scenario in many fields, like with diamonds, or internet access.",1459678501,d1nxzm8,t1_d1nxoml,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016
472,Kafke,"&gt;Since they won't, then all you will accomplish by eliminating IP is putting an end to investment in research and development. I don't know why you think that is a good idea.

It's not. It's a lose-lose situation in our current economic situation. Either we restrict development and free speech, or we remove the profitability of idea generation. As I said, we need to switch to a different model of society.

&gt;It is slow because it is more expensive and less reliable than alternatives.

It's more expensive because it's less profitable. It's less profitable because it hurts current business. Renewable energy runs *opposite* to current economic goals, despite it being something beneficial for humanity.

&gt;Where do you think that money goes? A magical idea bank?

I hate to break it to you, but money isn't real. Money is a forced obligation for society to provide labor.

&gt;But you can't infinitely reproduce cars or billion dollar research labs or the very real infrastructure required to enable internet access!

Sure you can. At least, much more than what our current economy allows. Take an expensive car, for example. It's not *really* expensive. Once we make the factory to produce it, we can make as many as we'd like. It's not *actually* expensive. In reality, we have hundreds, if not thousands, of these cars just sitting there going to waste because people don't have currency. So instead of vehicles being used efficiently and intelligently, they're going to waste.

As of right this second, this year so far (only a few months), there's been almost 19 million cars produced. In 2012 alone there were 60 million cars produced. In the US, there's about 300 million people.

If we ignored our current economic system, that means we could give every single american a car within 15 years. At which point we no longer need any cars. Combine that with ride sharing, self-driving cars, public transportation, etc. And we could cut that number down dramatically.

And if we remove the monetary system, we could scale up production of said cars if needed, meaning we could arrive at this goal even faster. But in reality, we don't need to do that. A good majority of americans *already have* cars. And those that don't could easily just take one that already exists and is sitting in a car lot.

For internet access, I hate to break it to you, but the lines weren't laid by the companies that own them. The companies that own them don't do any management or improvement upon the lines. They simply charge for them. On top of all that, our current lines and internet infrastructure is incredibly inefficient. We have legal systems *preventing* the improvement of such lines, along with our economy directly discouraging it.

All these barriers you're bringing up are *direct results* of our current economy. They aren't real barriers. They're pretend.",1459688439,d1o0owl,t1_d1ny7z0,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2016

Cases for CRISPR use are regularly at the center of controversy, as synthetic biology and DIY biotech hit the masses. Enormous shake-up to energy policy as coal rapidly declines, being replaced by a new generation of biofuels and solar. Housing crises are widespread, with many advocating for reforms to housing development and zoning laws. City-scale government lobbying and corruption is uncovered in many more places, sparking outrage in heavily populated cities. Education changes rapidly to meet a changing economy; VR education becomes widespread, with centralized schools acting less as places of instruction and more as places of mentorship. 
20 years: Increasing sensor density in daily life has increased calls for cybersecurity and privacy, both becoming more important each and every day. Climate change has dramatically worsened in some places, prompting international agreements that include a tax and transfer for program to alleviate the harms done to the Global South. Internet connectivity has reached a supermajority of the Global population, eroding social mores and traditions in many countries and sparking a wave of popular revolutions that lead to more democratic governments. The spread of the block chain protocol has many developed nations rejecting representative democracies, and calls for liquid democracy explode in frequency. A new space race amongst private companies urges new regulations and international controversy over low orbit property rights and asteroid mining rights. AI and video manipulation have become so advanced that a new wave of ""personality fraud"" pervades on the internet, causing distrust and petitions for labels on AI personalities. Most drugs by now are legal in many developed nations, with past funding for policing being reallocated to addiction treatment. Meanwhile, tobacco continues to decline in use.
30 years: The US has declined a major power. Popular revolutions of the 30s saw the US fracture into smaller nations; the first two to exist are Cascadia (PNW) and the Lone Republic of Texas. Alaska is threatening secession as the US loses its political grip on the world. Rising temperatures and the abandonment of oil as an energy source has destabilized the Middle East past the tipping point, sending the region into chaos and Exodus. Places where The Great Recession had a larger impact are less welcoming to these refugees, but many find new lives in the revitalized economies of southern Europe, which used coastal farming to bolster their food supply and create a source of exports for the regional economy. China has also lost political control over the world; student protests began occurring regularly as it was found that many were having their Sesame Credit manipulated. Democracy has spread, with Hong Kong acting as the first politically sovereign mega-city. Other mega-cities in this country continue down the same path of sovereignty. CRISPR becomes approved for use in human infanta, after decades of controversy and fear. Genetic diseases practically halt in prevalence, with very few people after this point being born with any.

6,Yuli-Ban,"Others have already raised great points, so I'm just going to play the Devil's Advocate for a couple particular aspects of what your CEO said.

&gt; He said that if self-driving cars were indeed the future, why not just ""fly around like the Jetsons?""

Believe it or not, this is actually a perfectly reasonable point. If cars can drive themselves, why not cross their autonomous abilities with things like drones and scale these drones up to helicopter size? And it turns out that's what several companies are pursuing: passenger drones. Your CEO would undoubtedly have laughed at you even harder if you brought up the fact passenger drones do indeed exist, but you'd be the one who got the last laugh.

&gt;  He continued by mentioning that he's ridden in a lot of cabs, and that he wouldn't trust a car that drives itself up to the curb to pick him up. Again, the crowd laughed along with him.

There are a lot of reasons why some people don't trust cars that drive themselves or think they're still superior to computers.

- Computers still fail. Not as often as they used to, but they are prone to viruses and hacking due to their ease of use. We haven't yet created perfectly safe computers, so to many, it seems too dangerous to trust them with our lives just yet.

- Overestimation of one's abilities. Contrary to what this and other AV-friendly subs may suggest, most people successfully navigate the world's roads without dying. Thus, they think they're masterful drivers who don't need to be replaced in the first place. Those who do get into accidents? That's just typical human error among those who don't pay attention when they most should, and coddling them by having their cars drive themselves would just enable worse driving habits. Yes, this is an actual argument I came across.

- Distrust of computers. Closely related to my first point, a lot of people (especially from the Baby Boomers all the way up to Millennials) *seriously* distrust computers. Even though over a million people die annually in car accidentals around the world, many people simply will ***not*** trust a computer to drive them if it isn't *absolutely perfect*. You can partially blame cultural Luddism for this. Remember ""Use the force, Luke""? The Death Star didn't blow up due to a computer, but Luke's natural abilities. To so many people, the idea that we should we start relying on computers with our lives sounds perfectly dystopian. Again, /r/Futurology and several other AV-friendly subs don't quite get this because we tend to believe people will always eventually come around to new technology (and they do!).

- Finally and probably involving the most unfounded speculation on my part, people don't just see autonomous cars as a dystopian surrendering of humanity— they also see them as *creepy*. [I even made a blog post about this](https://radiomonkeys.net/2016/12/25/paratechnology/), that if you were to go back to the 1970s, the idea of a car driving itself would make most people want to grab the holy water instead of get inside. The same idea applies today, even with AVs still in the news. It's a sort of uncanny valley feeling seeing a non-human act intelligently or in a human manner. If we could make animals that could talk and understand human speech (which is perfectly possible with near-future technology), yeah, some people *would* be the first in line to get their dog or cat upgraded. But many people would nevertheless regard talking animals as something evil and unnatural. Same thing applies to driverless cars.

I'll try and reframe it.  Our current economic model operates under the base assumption you need buys and sellers.  And human labour be it physical or mental is needed.  So there always a flow of money / capital and the system is self-driving. 


Automation that we are talking about here is closed loop production.  I.e. Mining, smelting, resource refinement, production, and transportation being completely a 100% human free.  With little to no human input.   And we are damn close to this.. arguably this could be done with creative uses of off the shelf technology. 

But what this effectively means is that it would be possible for the top 5% of the population to effectively have total self-reliance from the rest of the population.   They wouldn't need the economic engine of the modern world to have the same standard of living they have now.  Since they would own enough of the automation to bootstrap whatever they like.  

It's post-scarcity but in the hands of select few.

If a small company is using quickbooks now, and doesn't need to hire 3 accountants they would have needed in the 30's, should they get taxed for it?

about semi trucks i may differ a little with you.  I think they will become self-driving trucks.

Considering a semi truck is a much larger vehicle with a trailer designed for cargo only where are you going to put enough batteries to haul 50 tons 500 miles? Not to mention a lot of the US is pretty remote with a much less developed electrical grid in places than the UK or most European countries.

&gt;There seems to be this idea that people in the tech world feel they can solve any problem, and many of them don't see the big picture. 

Indeed. It's fundamentally worse than just ""not seeing the big picture"" it's a profound degree of fundamental IGNORANCE about just about everything, and then combined with a degree of ARROGANCE regarding their ability to ""solve"" whatever ""problems"" might crop up.

You see this kind of combination in just about everything that ""hi tech"" people enter -- whether its the ridiculous claims regarding 3D printing (right in this  thread {and even moreso elsewhere in this subreddit}, there are fools who not only *think* but openly state that *""Wait until we can 3D print a whole car!""* -- I mean we're talking some SERIOUS levels of ignorance+arrogance there); to other things like the whole ""autonomous/self-driving car"" stuff.

It tends to be a pervasive problem with not just ""tech"" people, but most especially with *software* people -- you see the same thing operating in the fact that the vast majority of software projects are 1) failures; 2) even if ""successful"" are never delivered on time, much less on-budget -- it's the mistaking of the idea that some ""proof of concept"" demo-hack is the equivalent of (or at least 90% completion of) some final production product.

76,acog,"I can't speak to the other guy but I've been assuming we're talking about level 5 because anything less isn't *really* self-driving IMO. I am not at all a big believer in systems like Tesla's current autopilot where you're expected to take control at a moment's notice. That'll only happen when you have to make a fast decision, and my bet is that people can't snap to attention fast enough after they've been texting or watching a movie or whatnot. 

From what I've read, more than one manufacturer is saying that they expect to be ready with full level 5 systems by 2021. That's why I was saying I think 5 years is feasible for the first units. 

But of course keep in mind that it's hard to estimate if a big software project will be on time if it's scheduled for 6 months from now, let alone multiple years. So I wouldn't be surprised if 5 years turns into 6+. Plus there's a difference between the tech being ready in a $80K Mercedes vs. a $20K Nissan -- early low volume technology is always more expensive and it might not be feasible for inexpensive cars at first. 

I also realize that ""ready for production"" doesn't mean ""ready for any possible conditions"". Like, the challenge of self-driving in LA with well-marked lanes is very different than self-driving in the Northeast where snow may have covered all the lane markers.

For the latter, I know more than one manufacturer is doing extremely high-res scanning, with the idea being that the car will have a map that actually has all the lanes internally (a level of detail that's not possible with civilian GPS) -- but initially they're only doing high traffic areas like airport-to-city core, for self-driving ride services.

1) the politics of destroying what's arguably the largest employer in the US (trucking).

Just as an aside, it turns out the whole ""truckers are the largest job"" was the result of lots of statistical interpretation errors. It's not even close to being the number one job category. It all goes to [this NPR story](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/02/05/382664837/map-the-most-common-job-in-every-state). Notice the map.

[Here's an article](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/no-truck-driver-isnt-the-most-common-job-in-your-state-2015-02-12) that points out the errors in the NPR story. Here's the TL;DR:

&gt; That’s where NPR was led astray. NPR looked at **a data set that aggregated various kinds of truck drivers into a single category but that didn’t aggregate other occupations in the same way**. The sorting was inconsistent, so the comparison isn’t a legitimate one, and it makes us think that truck driving is the most common occupation in many states.

84,SoylentRox,"&gt; It'll happen but IMO that timeline is way too aggressive. We'll probably see robust self-driving systems ready to hit the road in 5 years but it'll take a long time to diffuse throughout the economy.

The difference is that cars and trucks are replaced quite rapidly.  Average age is 12 years.  And with leasing agreements, you could make money over a human driven taxi or human driven semi _the first month_.  That is, the very first _month_ these systems are available in quantity,  you could pay the lease cost + insurance (which covers your financial risk if it crashes and if you're the owner, but not in it during a crash, there is no risk to your health or life) and it'll be less than what you are spending now for a human driver + lease + insurance.  

Another perspective is that when you talk about factory or warehouse automation, you are talking about expensive systems that only serve a niche.  Different factories have different processes and thus need custom systems, and warehouse workers are very cheap to pay and the items they handle can be very hard for robotics to handle every case.

Self driving is a very large niche - the cost of developing the automation gets split between tens of millions of vehicles that will be purchased (or leased) as soon as the tech is available and legal to use most places.  So it reduces the per vehicle cost and thus raises the ROI.

I think there will be a very, very rapid adoption.  About how fast smartphones were adopted.  And it'll be accelerating.  First year or 2 of wide release, I predict a shortage of available vehicles and elevated prices, and probably some bugs and a few well publicized crashes.  After the first couple years, the crash rate will be dropping with the major bugs ironed out, it will be statistically proven that they are far safer, and the actual vehicles should be widely available for purchase.",1488765620,dek3o7f,t1_dejt61p,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2017

Bingo.

The only way the masses will have bargaining power is if they have automation in their possession as well. I actually believe that with the rapidly decreasing cost of technology, this may be realistic.

111,ponieslovekittens,"&gt;What has changed? Nothing I'm sure, but I don't recall automation being a trending topic a few years back.

I think it's the impending arrival of self-driving vehicles that's prompted a fair portion of the rising concerns. Back when the interstate highways were built, entire towns fell apart because traffic simply drove _past_ them rather than through them.

Trucking jobs altogether are about 5 million out of 152 million jobs in the US. Which is a significant number, but there are far more jobs that are _dependent_ on the existence of those trucking jobs, that might go away too. 5 million fewer truckers means fewer truck stops. Fewer waitressing jobs at truck stops. Fewer insurance sales jobs because those self driving trucks will be insured by their manufacturer in single, mass packages rather than millions of individual contracts. Fewer commercial class driving schools, instructors, marketers, etc. Fewer auto maintenance techs because they'll be controlled by cheap, disposable microprocessors rather than  hundreds of mechanical moving parts like steering wheels and gas pedals. Fewer tow truck drives because there will be fewer accidents, and fewer emergency room hospital staff because even when there are accidents there won't be as many humans on the road being injured.

And this all of the top of my head. How many other jobs are there that aren't trucking but exist because of trucking? How many jobs are there that maybe only 20% of the job exists because of the trucking industry, but if you have a million people working jobs for which 20% of the work is now irrelevant, that means you need 200,000 fewer people?

When you add up all those other jobs together with the 5 million or so trucking jobs...we're potentially talking about a rather _large_ percent of total employment. And this transition might take place over the next merely ten years. Given the way vehicles are depreciated for tax purposes, it's plausible to think that fleet conversions would happen in less than a 5-7 year time frame, and this process is likely to begin somewhere in the 2017-2020 range. By somewhere in the 2022-2027 range, we might be seeing a _lot_ of jobs simply vanishing, just like so many towns vanished when the interstates were built.

WARNING: THIS IS A WALL OF TEXT WITH NO TLDR AND NO FILTER YOU LIKELY WONT LEARN ANYTHING FROM THIS,
probably better to not even try to read it
 just some research and some of my thoughts.

note my bias in all this: I am studying to become an engineer, so I would most likely be one of those not affected by all this. (except if taxes go crazy to pay everyone (bias incoming) to sit around and not do or add anything to society.

So, taking a look at OP's article, there isn't much too it. It explains that %35 of the workforce of America is currently at risk of being automated. What it fails to do is look at what and where these people go, it does say that the potential loss for our government could be catastrophic monetarily because of the lost tax money, and wonders why no legislation 'fixing' this is put in place (heavily implying it's lobbying, but not really connecting the two).

This article:
http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21700758-will-smarter-machines-cause-mass-unemployment-automation-and-anxiety

Estimates higher, 47% of the population is at risk. Then says this creates some of the polarization talked about above. The comparison is then made to the industrial revolution. It even explains that the arguments that are now being made for the revolutionary changes that robotics and machines will cause are parallel to the arguments made during the industrial revolution. Economists also notice this: ""in the past technology has always ended up creating more jobs than it destroys. That is because of the way automation works in practice, explains David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."" 

 * ATM's. They thought the teller would become obsolete, however the actual number of branches increased, and so employment from the banks increased as well. 
 * self driving cars have a response very similar to the response of cars themselves. They had thought the switch would cause too much disruption. 
 * Kodak, which once employed 145,000 people making photographic products, went into bankruptcy at around the same time [instgram was bought by facebook]. But such comparisons are misleading, says Marc Andreessen. It was smartphones, not Instagram, that undermined Kodak, and far more people are employed by the smartphone industry and its surrounding ecosystems than ever worked for Kodak or the traditional photography industry.

The article then addresses that technology tends to create jobs where people expect there are none, we can not predict where the jobs are created, just they they are. This was explained by Joel Mokyr, an economic historian at Northwestern University. The impact today is more broad, computers affect nearly every aspect of society today.

This study supports the notion of robots displacing workers

https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/21/how-robots-will-reshape-the-us-economy/
In here they actually talk about automation increasing the demand of labor in the US. not because they displace workers, but because the increased automation lowers costs for company's, which will eventually offset the factors that drove the away such as taxes and a higher minimum wage than other nations. 

https://www.interest.co.nz/opinion/86292/matt-nolan-presents-his-top-10-links-economics-automation
Matt Nolan claims that the correlation between automation and unemployment is not actually causation. He says that there are outside factors that are driving the unemployment, automation is merely changing the nature of the labor. 
He later says the the industrial revolution did stagnate wages for a while, as long as 40 years, before the net increase was fully realized. (as an aside, he also attributes the welfare state to this stagnation). The middle skilled workers during this time had the choice of re training and maintain or receiving a higher pay, or returning to a lower skilled job. ""There is a key point here. The automation of manufacturing work does not mean there are no jobs – and the areas in the US that experienced this have low unemployment rates and have had employment creation. "" This article supports a universal basic income.

https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-05-12/robots-versus-the-middle-class
In here they acknowledge the risks of automation, however say that in order to smooth the translation, we should be focusing on building new businesses, not on lower class people. These new businesses will create new capital and demand for labor, rather than redistributing wealth.


So what does this all say?
Automation will be disruptive. That much is agreed upon. The response seems muddied and unclear. Some people strongly suggest universal basic income or some other form of wealth redistribution, others say that this will be no different than previous revolutions, and more labor will be demanded, and so offset those that have lost their job. This transition will take years, if not decades, depending upon the pace of technology and other factors, however in either case, the wealth and standard of living for our nation will be increased.

Personally, even after reading all of this, I am still unconcerned. I feel as if access to creating business and education is increased, these will smooth this transition. Surely there will be people that are lost in this system, and people that lower their standard of living, but overall I believe the net will be positive. I think the way to do this is deregulation and removing taxes for this kind of thing. 

The way to actually increase the availability of these things is up to much debate, subsidies or lassie fare or any other system.

128,ponieslovekittens,"&gt; Why do you think that? 

Because the ""we transferred to new jobs"" model misses a crucial point.

The vast majority of ""new' jobs aren't actually new. The vast majority of jobs we have today are _thousands of years old_, except they use new tools.

The [three sectors of economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-sector_theory) model has described employment over the past several thousand year fairly well. You basically have three different ""categories"" of employment:

1) People who collect resources. Historically that's mostly comprised of agriculture, though it does include mining also. 

2) People who do something with those resources. Manufacturing, basically.

3) People who provide human services. People who move the resources around, people who move the finished goods around, people who sell the goods, people who clean and maintain the goods, prostitution, lawyers, accounting, etc.

Agriculture, manufacturing and services, pretty much all of employment throughout history has fallen into one of these three categories. These categories are _not new_, and most jobs aren't really new. Sure, we didn't have Walmart cashiers 2000 years ago, but we _did_ have merchants and money-changers at the local bazaar. We didn't have Starbucks baristas 2000 years ago, but we _did_ have tavern wenches and serving girls. These jobs aren't really new. 

And even the jobs that _are_ new, still fall into these three basic categories. We didn't have computer programmers 1000 years ago, but ""programmer"" is a service profession, and we've had the service sector of employment for thousands of years. We didn't have people making computer circuit boards 1000 years ago, but circuit board manufacture is...manufacturing. And we've had manufacturing for thousands of years. The _tools_ we use have changed, and ""new"" jobs created in the sense of using those new tools, but the general three-sector classification has been pretty constant for thousands of years.

If you look at the historical transition from old jobs replaced by automation to ""new"" jobs, the transition is a very simple one. At one time, most people were involved in agriculture. When agriculture was automated, ""new"" jobs were created in manufacturing. And far a time, most people were employed in manufacturing. Then when manufacturing was automated, ""new"" jobs were created in the service sector.

And that's where we are today.

If the service sector becomes mostly automated...where are these new jobs going to be created? Because agriculture, manufacturing and services are _thousands of year old_ employment categories, and if all three become automated, there isn't really any ""new' place for those new jobs to be created.

&gt;I have no problem imagining jobs that we need filled...even in my own company let alone our entire economy!

Ok. And how many of those jobs can you think of that don't fall into the three sector model? List for me some jobs please, that don't involve 1) gathering resources 2) producing goods 3) providing human services.

If the service industry is automated next, what new jobs can possibly exist?

Think of it this way: if you ""invented"" a new type of fruit, would that create a whole bunch of jobs? Probably not. because the _types_ of tools that we use to automate agriculture are flexible enough that they can accommodate a variety of specific products. When Apple or Microsoft or HTC or an other company crates a ""new"" hardware device, does that result in a massive new influx of dozens of millions of ""new economy"" jobs? No, the new product is typically  produced at existing plants via similar
methods. Sure, maybe there's some retooling involved, sure there are still some humans involved, but ""new product"" doesn't result in massive amounts new jobs and new employment, as it did when we transitioned from agriculture to manufacturing, and again when we transitioned from manufacturing to service economy. So once services become mostly automated, ""new services"" are unlikely to produce large numbers of new jobs either.

Today, most people are employed in service industry jobs. If you open a new brick and mortor store, you need lots of people to physically run the place, to restock shelves, to help customers, to operate cash registers, etc. That might not be true for very much longer. Take a look at amazon go, for example.  Consider Fedex shipping. Google tells me they employ 400,000 people. Right now if you wanted to create a new shipping company to compete with them, presumably you'd also need hundreds of thousands of humans to ship the kind of volume they do. That might not be true for very much longer. Consider self driving vehicles and autonomous delivery drones. Those will probably be on the market within the next several years.

If the service sector becomes mostly automated, like agriculture and manufacturing have become mostly automated, where are these new jobs going to appear? Doing what? Providing what _category_ of job function? 

&gt;There is absolutely no shortage of demand for smart people to do that which only humans can do and robots cannot.

Like what? What are these things robots will still be unable to do in 20 years for which there's enough demand that you can run a wage-based economy off of?

You say ""no shortage"" but even right now, ""smart people"" jobs are by far the _minority_ of jobs that exist. There are only about 1.4 million ([328,000](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-programmers.htm) plus [1.1 million](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm) programming jobs in the US, for example. But [4.8 million](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/sales/retail-sales-workers.htm) retail sales workers. Only [72,000](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/aerospace-engineers.htm) aerosapce engineers, but [4.7 million](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/food-preparation-and-serving/food-and-beverage-serving-and-related-workers.htm) food and beverage servers. Typically by their nature, these ""smart people jobs"" don't employ very many people because knowledge work is easily mass-produced. If you want to install 1000 machines at a 1000 different locations, you have to send people out to all of those 1000 places to phsyically install them. If you want to deploy software to a million people, one guy can put it on a website. It doesn't take 1000 engineers to design 1000 planes. You can have a small team of people design _one_ plane and then build a thousand of them. It's difficult to come up with a scenario where knowledge-based work becomes abundant enough to run an entire economy off of it. 

At one time for example, [one sixth of all american workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_automobile_industry_in_the_1950s) were employed by the auto manufacturing industry. We replaced most of them with machines. But we don't have one sixth of employment today involved in designing, programming and maintaining robots. if you're thinking that we'll need programmers and engineers to maintain all these robots we're going to have, history has shown that's not what happens when you automate industries.

Horse farmers did not represent a significant portion of total employment, and in addition, the advancement wasn't in the actual labor, it was in the method of travel.  A new industry was being created that would have vastly increased demand from consumers, necessitating redirection of labor to meet the productivity demands.

Much simpler examples of methods of productivity being advanced would be the replacement of elevator operators or telephone operators by similar technology.  Thankfully, these were very small portions of the total labor force.

What we're seeing now is a rapid advancement in the capacity of machines to complete all types of labor.  Furthermore, rather than just being ""unskilled"" labor being replaced, even some skilled labor is being replaced by computers.  The sheer amount of work that can now be automated and is in the process of it being done is staggering.

Software to replace various type of clerks and assistants could replace 4 million jobs.  Self-driving vehicles could replace 2.5 million.    Automated legal document analysis threaten up to a half million paralegals and entry-level lawyers.  The list goes on and on.  It does not take the same amount of labor to create this software as it replaces... not even close.  And once developed, the only continued work needed for these systems are either further productivity advancement to eliminate more positions, and limited maintenance.  This doesn't even approach the potential loss if actual AI is developed.

There will be no burgeoning demand for these fields;  there is no new product, and the only new service is the one replacing the employees themselves, which requires massively less labor than the millions of jobs replaced, hence the cost savings.

164,drakenot,"&gt; Computers are already much more highly efficient than our brains at numerous tasks, I do think it's more or less settled that consciousness requires more than a ""very powerful"" computer.

I never made the claim that we would have emergent consciousness from raw horsepower alone.  Just that it may be a prerequisite, much like how our current success with neural networks didn't happen until we had the power and data to train and run them.  

&gt; I don't think it was ever assumed that ""intelligence"" in a certain form and ""consciousness"" had to be linked. If it was, that was certainly a long time ago because weak AI has been around in some form for a while now.

People have been doing this very thing since the inception of the AI field.  Every time AI conquers a new domain, from Chess to Go, from self driving cars to cancer detection, people move the goal posts of what is considered ""intelligence"". Things that skeptics originally claimed could only be done by humans, once proved that they could be done by machines, suddenly say, ""Well, of course a computer could do that.  But *that* isn't intelligence.""

&gt; I mean, maybe? I can't say it's an impossibility, but it seems highly unlikely to me.

Let me give a recent example.  David Cope is a musicology professor.  He spent 7 years writing a program to generate music in the style of Bach called EMI.  Critics of EMI program said that while the pieces it composed were ""technically"" excellent, they lacked depth that a human composer could give the music.  

Another musicology professor, Professor Larson, challenged Cope:  he would play his own compositions, the compositions of EMI, and genuine Bach pieces to his music students.  They would then vote on which pieces were from which source.  

The students, after listening to the pieces in a blind listening test, concluded that the EMI's music was genuine Bach, the Bach pieces were Larson's and that Larson's compositions were that of EMI's.    The program managed to fool a room full of musicology college students.

I would not at all be surprised to see a lot of future music being composed by AI, and that much of it would be indistinguishable from human composed music in blind studies.  This is just one small example of narrow weak ai challenge human creativity.  There are other examples as well.

&gt; I agree with this, and so ok with the assumption that we can and will eventually replicate consciousness at some future date I would then agree that you are correct. I mean, on a near-infinite time scale if humanity survives then all manner of weird shit is going to be created ...

Ok, good.  So, if we are on the same page that this is *technically* possible, now we are just quibbling about timeline.  

Nick Bostrom, of the Future of Humanity Institute, created a poll where he asked numerous AI researchers what the chances of achieving strong AI are in the near future.  

*The median response in Bostrom’s poll gives a fifty-fifty chance that human-level A.I. would be attained by 2050. Richard Sutton, a Canadian computer scientist whose work has earned tens of thousands of scholarly citations, gives a range of outcomes: there is a ten-per-cent chance that A.I. will never be achieved, but a twenty-five-per-cent chance that it will arrive by 2030.  These surveys are unscientific, but he is confident enough to offer an interpretive assumption: “It is not a ridiculous prospect to take seriously the possibility that it can happen in the lifetime of people alive today.”*",1489017919,deoqazb,t1_deomn9q,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2017

Things that skeptics originally claimed could only be done by humans, once proved that they could be done by machines, suddenly say, ""Well, of course a computer could do that. But that isn't intelligence.""

I guess I'm just not aware of these skeptics. I can't imagine anyone ever seriously saying that a computer couldn't possibly be programmed to drive a car, hypothetically. Even in the 50's. 

But it depends on what definition of intelligence you're using. If it's just the ability to draw more and more complex conclusions from more and more data inputs, then sure - and I don't know why anyone at any point familiar with computers would ever say that intelligence of that kind cannot continue to grow. 

&gt;The students, after listening to the pieces in a blind listening test, concluded that the EMI's music was genuine Bach, the Bach pieces were Larson's and that Larson's compositions were that of EMI's. The program managed to fool a room full of musicology college students.

Yes, it successfully fooled them by doing a great imitation of established human art. That is programmable, yes. 

&gt;I would not at all be surprised to see a lot of future music being composed by AI, and that much of it would be indistinguishable from human composed music in blind studies.

It could be, it's not that complicated. Music has quantifiable rules. Combine that with programming describing various techniques of music that are successful at drawing out human emotion and you'll have a very nice little AI pop artist that imitates human music just great. I don't deny this is possible. I would just point out that it's entirely dependent on parameters set by human programmers. 

What I would deny is possible is that such an AI program would ever be able to ""experiment"" and try alternative approaches to music without being programmed to. Imitation, sure. Variation within set parameters, sure. Innovation? No. Context? No.

I have no doubt that you could probably program a 30 year old computer to make a wonderful Jackson Pollock style painting. Whoop de do. Does that make it art? Well it looks like art. It will serve the purpose of art. But you'll notice that in any art gallery, especially abstract ones, there's lots of context provided about the artist's intentions and influences and the meaning of the project/exhibit. Because that's what people connect with on an artistic level. Looking at something that happens to look pretty or cool is just decorative aesthetics, art is aesthetics + cultural context.


&gt;Ok, good. So, if we are on the same page that this is technically possible

Well I say that because it sure would be silly of me to say that something is technically impossible, forever. I think that currently it appears ""impossible"" in the sense that all our work on the subject has not generated any progress. We haven't developed a computer that is ""1% conscious"". It's all stuck at 0. I am obliged to throw in a ""for now"" just because its irrational to assume that that could never change under any circumstances.

In my opinion the majority of forecast opinions always seem to *overestimate* what a computer will be capable of doing in the near future. We've been hearing about self driving cars for decades. 

&gt; What seems obvious to you today, was not always so. It only becomes ""obvious"" once it is achieved. You saying that a machine can't beat humans at painting or music is the equivalent of what Dreyfus said in his time.

No it isn't. Painting or music is not a game that you can win or lose. Winning at a game is a quantifiable thing with a definable set of circumstances. Creating actual art requires you to have some sort of reference to the real world. I agree that computers can make art that looks just like human art. They just won't be able to do it with the same intentions, which makes it imitation, not genuine creation.

&gt;If we had AI that could compose music in all genres that was indistinguishable by humans from that of another artist, that is an insane achievement! If we had that, then the vast majority of music listened to by humans would be written by machines. You would have a veritable pop hit machine producing music as fast as we could consume.

Assuming they actually *produce* the music themselves as well, which is possible but quite a ways away. Then you would have a great system of delivering music for consumers, like McDonalds is a great system of delivering certain types of food. But you aren't going to see it delivering anything unique unless a human programs it to do something like that. That would require a level of subjective reasoning which in turn requires the self-aware ability to actually hear the music and respond to it as a listener does. 

&gt;Just like DeepMind playing Atari, or AlphaGo beating Lee Sedol in Go. They didn't teach AlphaGo all of the advanced techniques that a professional Go player might play. Instead, they taught what the allowed moves were, and let it play millions of games against itself. These games helped form the ultimate weights of the neural network that defeated the world champion.

Did they teach it what the end state of winning was supposed to look like? Because if they did then that sounds like basically the same thing. What you're describing sounds like having an AI determine the most efficient way to achieve an defined outcome. As impressive as the actual means by which it may do so, it still sounds like a generic function of a computer to me. Not that there isn't a ton of stuff to be done with that, but creative idea generation or subjective intention doesn't seem like it's on the menu.",1489034325,dep2b9x,t1_deos5b7,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2017

I think it's going to start in earnest at the tail end of my lifetime, assuming I life to 80s. (In my 30s now.) That's not much time at all to get the massive shift in mentality that will need to happen. People lose their shit about welfare programs now, and many think UBI would be welfare. There's going to be a lot of work to overcome the ""don't be lazy"" mentality, even if laziness isn't the issue and there actually aren't many jobs.

&gt;You guys really think every truck driving company has the cash to buy self driving vehicles? 

Not at the moment, but they will. Especially as non self-driving ones become scarcer over time. 

&gt;Every production plant has tens of millions laying around to build specialized robotics? 

This sounds like, ""Do you think every American has $50,000 to buy a personal computer? PAH!"" Robotics are coming down in price, like VCRs and personal computers did. 

Over time, some of the big companies that do have the money invent and/or license their tech to smaller companies. (See: Amazon.) 

Additionally, there are things like Trump's Carrier deal, which required Carrier to make a US investment of X dollars in its company. Carrier announced that it would use its required investment to speed up automation, and admitted that many of the jobs that had been ""saved"" would be replaced by automation.

183,sanem48,"1) modern aircraft are already computer flown. the pilot tells it what to do, but the computer actually does it. meaning you could in theory just as easily hack them today. the other day Wikileaks said the CIA was thinking about hacking self driving cars, but you can be sure they've been hacking airplanes for decades (the Pentagon suggested in the 60's to Kennedy to swap an airliner with a remote controller aircraft and crash it, so they could blame it on Castro and invade Cuba)

2) automating aircraft further would greatly increase their safety record, regardless of the presence of pilots, because they can things humans cannot, such as superhuman awareness (360 degree night/day/clouds vision), reflexes (allowing it to dodge birds for example), and nerves of steel

3) pilots are only human, are known to fall asleep (both of them) while flying, can have suicidal tendencies (Germanwings Flight 9525), hijack the plane completely (malaysia airlines flight 370), drink, have a heart attack, food poisoning, get taken over by passengers, have poor vision on landing (Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash)...

4) a flight supervisor probably isn't a bad idea, although sitting alone in the cockpit they WILL fall asleep, I'll guarantee you that much

187,worff,"There's no sugarcoating it.  In the 2020's we'll see massive automation and disruption of markets just because of the self driving car.  Not just the people who make their living behind the wheel -- but the multitude of businesses that support cars -- like the insurance industry.

Some lawyers can be replaced -- there's that chat bot that fights parking tickets.  Doctors too -- Watson will help it so health care providers -- urgent cares, doctors offices, hospitals -- don't need as many human employees.

Chefs, cooks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNy6fEuPWbc

When every restaurant can have a robot in the back loaded with Gordon Ramsay's recipes AND Gordon Ramsay's human motions programmed into the bionics -- chefs won't be needed.  Most restaurants will probably still have a human head chef to decide the menu and do the shopping, but sous chefs?  Gone.  Any restaurant with a simple enough menu?  Probably going to be entirely automated.  Oh and self checkouts?  Everything in grocery stores can be automated.  All the stocking can be.  The cleaning can be.  Let me dive into it a bit more.

With the right software and additional sensors and programming, it can do anything a human can do.  This will be how heavier things are delivered - groceries, beds, whatever.  So no more UPS or FedEx or USPS carriers.  Construction, landscaping, a multitude of military uses.  Elevator technicians, plumbers, electricians - in some capacity.  It won't fully displace humans entirely, but people will buy them to avoid hiring as many people.

He can replace all sorts of miscellaneous jobs.  Bellboys, porters, production assistants on movie sets, tour guides, security guards, maids and custodial workers, possibly even childcare one day.  Dog walkers, traffic cops, waiters.  Then any specialized profession will eventually have a robot created to replace it.  Yoga teachers or fitness instructors.  Background dancers (if they aren't just generated with VFX).  Military uses.  Patrol cops.  Delivery that doesn't need to be as fast -- like room service.  Lighter things, companies will deliver with drones.  Camera operators in sports events and news settings -- predictable and routine settings that don't require creative choices - they'll be replaced by drones or remote cameras on tripods with face tracking and autofocus.

**Another thing about automation and technological advances is it's not just robots.** It's smartphone apps, it's consumer products that make things easier and make it so people don't need a professional, it's any kind of software. It's digital assistants like Alexa and Cortana.  They'll replace phone systems, tech support, receptionists.  And be integrated with the above two robots and really anything else that moves from A to B.  

**Nobody is safe unless you're doing something innately human.**  I'd say anyone managing other humans is safe.  Creatives, although the market will diminish.  Those who work in conflict resolution will still have a lot of work.  Psychiatrists and psychologists and talk therapists and life coaches -- their business will BOOM.  Religion will boom.  Cottage industry will boom.  Anyone who creates objects of value -- tangible objects of value.  Art, sculpture, pottery, tools, weapons,.  Camera operators who DO have to make creative decisions.  Really anyone creative -- film industry, theater, music -- they'll be pretty much untouched.  The arts will blossom.  Content creators will be some of the few who can make money.  But they'll have to be good enough to be able to build an audience.  Fashion world design world, they're pretty safe as well.  Anyone who makes T-shirts in their garage will probably still be just fine, too.  

**Although**....do consider that all of the above people exempt from automation displacement will have to face a greatly diminished market of potential consumers.  So *read the previous paragraph again* thinking about what people will find unnecessary when they're unemployable and what little money they have saved and can barely earn by other means is all they have for housing and food and warmth or AC.

**If you want to give your student some kind of hope** tell her that it's going to be family and friends -- or just people working and living together, sharing the burden -- to weather this coming storm.

There's going to be a rough transition period and the financial elite will continue to grow in power, influence, and the burden of responsibility will be on them ultimately.

It will come down to a choice between two things:

What we've known for a long time is that we can build assessments which are far better at classifying people. Meaning things like setting bail, sentencing, and rehabilitation needs can be administered far more efficiently by a test/assessment than a judge or probate officer. 

But people hate it. Seriously, the public hates the outcome. We know that in cases of spousal murder that both parties likely never committed a crime before, and they will likely never commit a crime again. So an assessment would say minimal services needed. But the public hates that. They want to see the person fry. 

And on the other hand you'll get 18 yr old defendant for minor robbery or car theft with a string of petty crimes before it. The assessments would say immediate high interesity intervention because this is the career path of deviant behavior. But people will cry waste of resources, he only stole a car it's not THAT big of deal. They'll say ""Just give him a year to think about it and it'll be sorted"".

People suck at judging other people.

So we've known for a long time how to dramatically improve the criminal justice system, but the people hate what the answer is. It has become politicized now. If you want to put an assessment into a computer and call it an AI I don't care. As long as it tricks the people into accepting the answers I'm down for anything.

205,ponieslovekittens,"&gt;People built houses

&gt;We had doctors

&gt;We had entertainment and arts

Yes, but I think you missed the point here. When we speak of ""new jobs"" in most case these new jobs aren't performing new tasks. Rather, they're performing old tasks in new ways and using new tools.

Again, I gave the example of transportation already. ""Driving a truck"" is a new job in a sense, but it replaced an old job ""driving a horse drawn cart."" The purpose of both those jobs is to do the same thing: move people and stuff around. Trucks are new tools, but moving people and stuff around is thousands of years old.

Yes, creating new tools changes the manner in which tasks are performed, but if you remove humans from needing to perform that tasks, you tend not to have many new jobs for humans performing that task because it's been automated. For example, agriculture is mostly automated today. So if you were to genetically engineer a new type of fruit that had never existed before, would you expect that to result in millions of new agricultural jobs for humans planting and harvesting the new fruit? No, of course not. It would be harvested using the same automated methods that we harvest all the other fruit.

So, imagine that self driving cars and airborne delivery drones take over the transportation market. The _tasks_ of moving stuff around becomes automated. Just like with fruit, you wouldn't expect many new jobs moving stuff around because there'd be no point. That task would already be automated.

New tools are common, but new _tasks_ happen extremely rarely.

&gt;There are more people working today than ever before.

Not in terms of _percent_ of population. Even setting aside the long term trends and excluding the child labor demographic, the proportion of modern legal working age adults today that is working has been on a leisurely but consistently downward trend since roughly 2000. Here's a labor force participation rate chart from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics:

https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000

Yeah, sure, there's ""more people working"" in absolute terms now than there were a hundred years ago, but the population is a whole lot bigger too. Saying that ""more people are working"" at a time when we have [hundreds of millions](https://www.google.com/#q=us+population&amp;*) of people compared to a time when we only had [a quarter as many people](https://www.google.com/#q=us+population+in+1900&amp;*9), that doesn't mean anything.

&gt;did you take into account the life expectancy in ye olde times?

**YES**, actually. Thank you for bringing up that point! Accounting for life expectancy actually further demonstrates my premise very nicely. Let me copy and paste from my message history, because I've made this exact point a number of times:

During much of the 1800s, a 10 year old [source 1](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2017/article/history-of-child-labor-in-the-united-states-part-1.htm) [source 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaker_boy#Use_of_breaker_boys) [source 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour#The_Industrial_Revolution) child could reasonably be expected to be involved in the production of _economic goods and/or services_.  Maybe working in the field, maybe in a factory, maybe in coal mine...whatever. But they were producing _economic output_ that was consumed by society. That work, in one form or another, would typically continue until the day they died...on average around (adjusting for high infant mortality rates, not the average): about [age 58](https://gcanyon.wordpress.com/2009/06/25/life-expectancy-in-the-1800s-not-as-bad-as-reported/), when they died.

So, 48 out of 58 years spent producing economic output. About 83% of their lifetime.

Today, when does the average person start producing economic goods and services? [65%](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/26/business/fewer-us-high-school-graduates-opt-for-college.html?_r=0) of high schoolers go on to college. But they don't all graduate, so let's say on average it's about age 20 that people enter the workforce. Retirement happens in the [age 62 to 67 range](https://www.nasi.org/learn/socialsecurity/retirement-age), let's say 65. Current life expectancy in the US is about [age 79](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm). 

So, work from 20 to 65, live 79 years...45 out of 79 years spent producing economic output. About 57% of their lifetime.

**A reduction from 83% of a lifetime to 57% of a lifetime spent working.** That's a lot less.

&gt;We're creating more and more jobs all the time

Both of your links shows total employment, not accounting for population growth. If you go from 60 out of 100 people working to 100 out of 200 people working, yes that's ""40 more jobs"" but it's a drop from 60% to 50% who are working. Again, here is current [labor force participation rate  data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000).

The _proportion_ of the adult population that is working has been dropping for about 16 years.

Just for fun, what percent of the total population do you think is employed today? Just take a guess. It's actually less than half.

 * US population is [about 319 million](https://www.google.com/#q=us+population&amp;*)

 * There are [152 million jobs](http://www.deptofnumbers.com/employment/us/)

152 divided by 319 is 47%. Only 47% of the total US population has a job. Do you think that was the case ~150 years ago back when we had [10 year olds working 60 hours a week in coal mines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaker_boy#Use_of_breaker_boys)? No, of course not.

&gt;the widespread introduction of computers in businesses that made everything faster

&gt;yet the jobs keep appearing.

The impact of computers in the 1970-1990s was a significant uptick in average work requirement. We saw the same thing happen during the early gearing up phase of the industrial revolution. More work was required to build those factories get the steel industry going and build those cities and so forth, but once everything was established the work requirement dropped to below pre-industrial levels. The data suggests that the peak for the computer era happened in the 1997-2000 range, and work requirements have been dropping ever since.

&gt;Luddites

I'm sorry, but your facts are wrong. I've cited sources and shown you the math showing that we've gone from 83% to 57% of a lifetime spent working. At the same time, we also work less during the part of our lifetime that we do work.

Here's an encyclopedia entry from the [economic history association](https://eh.net/encyclopedia/hours-of-work-in-u-s-history/). Tables 1 and 2 show the diminishing average work week going back to 1830. Take a look at table 6, comparing total lifetime hours worked. Not only do we spend a smaller fraction of our years working, we spend a smaller total number of hours working over the course of our entire lives. A reduction of 33% from 1880 to 1995, and from the shape of the curve they project a further 38% reduction by 2040. 

Honestly, isn't all this data this exactly what you would expect? If you keep introducing labor saving devices and automating work, wouldn't you expect work to diminish? Sure, not always. Sometimes instead of working less to produce the same amount of stuff, you work the same to produce more stuff. But it doesn't make sense to keep producing more and more stuff all the way to infinity.

If you live in an agrarian society where you have to work a certain amount to not starve to death, yes when you make that auto-cow milker or whatever that allows you to produce twice as much milk, it doesn't make sense to work half as much and stay on the edge of starvation. You use it to produce more milk, and maybe you work just as much. But that doesn't continue forever. You can't drink infinitely many gallons of milk. You can't eat an infinite amount of cheese. At some point instead of making more you use that increased efficiency to work less. And that's exactly what we've seen.

And yes, sometimes you make entirely new things. We didn't have cars and cellphones and computer in the 1800s. These were new things and we wanted those new things so it made sense to work more to produce them. But just like you can't drink an infinite amount of milk or eat infinite cheese, you can't drive an infinite number of cars or use an infinite number of cellphones. You could probably work more hours right now and buy cellphones more often, but you don't. You would rather work less and only replace your cellphone once every year or two rather than work an extra 5 hours a week and replace your cellphone every few months. At _some_ point, eventually increases in production efficiency result in less work rather than more stuff.

And that's exactly what we've seen. The trend going back 200 years is one of both increased productivity and reduced work requirement.

206,SnowyDuck,"Okay so excellent question. The assessments are usually built by universities and non-profit NGO's for the purpose of reducing recidivism. So these work by utilizing specific crimes and they don't really care what specific crime is committed. I can only give rough examples since it's been a few years since I worked on one.

So specific crimes will be weighted differently. Shoplifting has a different score then burglary, and these are all effected by use of weapons, violence, if they're property only, etc. Imagine a super complex RPG and you're trying to figure out how to min/max a boss. Same concept here. 

If marijuana use doesn't have a reliable indicator into any other crime then it's a useless metric and won't be used. If marijuana use does have a good correlation for further substance abuse then it'll be used in the substance abuse category. And so on for whatever factors you feel are important: employment, social relationships, sexual deviance, etc., etc.

Generally these assessments will give a couple different scores often based on needs. So your teenage delinquent might get a 1/10 for drug abuse (low need), but score a 9/10 on relationships (high need), and a 8/10 on employment and stability. In the past a judge would probably sentence him to AA and 3 years probation. Now you now know you need to spend money on getting him into a good home and get him either into school or job training. And you'll know which people that employment/foster care won't help.

226,boytjie,"&gt;There's going to be a huge market for retirees (and free spirits) buying RVs with auto-drive and living a semi-nomadic life.

I think the scale of economic dislocation is being underestimated with rapidly advancing tech and the joblessness prospects on the horizon. With self driving, electric EV’s and sleeping overnight to be in a new place in the morning, people can move from RV park to RV park with the weather, economic opportunity, and their whimsy. What’s stopping them? No fuel. Recharge electricity is included in the camping costs (**that** you can’t evade). It’s not totally free (what is?) but it’s a lot cheaper and an interesting lifestyle. 

Cost of RV’s is a big issue for the younger market. But consider:

A 2nd hand RV market (once the market is mature) will bring costs down. Even with a crap job, a few months salary saved by living, eating and having mom do your laundry at home will enable you to make a substantial down payment. If your girl/boy friend does the same you will have more than enough money to buy your RV and hit the road. Mom won’t be as panicky about road accidents either with the safety records of autonomous RV’s. I suspect that dads might secretly support you, envious that these options weren’t available in their youth. The market will dictate manufacturing quality. I would imagine that a cheap way to remain lightweight would be to improve insulation. This will also be an advantage of the 2nd hand market because previous owners would have improved RV’s for their own comfort. Limited storage and living space? The buyers would know that. It’s an RV. This is the adoption of a different lifestyle – a modicum of research would ensure the buyers are aware of issues when they make decisions to become nomads. RV living constraints won’t come as an unpleasant surprise. Stuff is going to be VERY different in 10 years.

In October 2010, four driverless electric vans successfully concluded a 13,000-kilometer test drive from Italy to China, Nevada has issued the first set of regulations for driverless cars, and WIRED magazine recently ran a cover story anticipating driverless cars in your life in the near future.

Most estimates I see place these things on the road commercially in the 2017 to 2020 range. Once they're available, if they're cheaper and more reliable and have more uptime than a human who needs to sleep,  there will be immediate cost/benefit incentive to replace them.

Now let's say a self-driving truck costs $100,000 instead of $80,000.

Imagine buying a human-driven truck _today_, and self driving trucks becoming commercially available _tomorrow_. Even if you _throw away_ the $80,000 truck you just bought and buy a self-driving truck, it only takes you five years to come out ahead.

 That was kind of my point. Don't say 'robot chauffeurs' exist until they're demonstrably out there chauffeuring people around at a level of capability reasonably approximate to what you would expect a from human chauffeur.

Chris Urmson, who was there for Darpa and went on to lead Google's Driverless car program said last March:

306,deftware,"Kurzweil's just another dreamer with fantastical ideas. He has more wrong predictions than he does correct ones as time goes by. We're coming up on his 2019 predictions from Age of Spiritual Machines, and it's not even that we're still a long ways off from certain technologies he proposes, it's that the trends just aren't even there.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_made_by_Ray_Kurzweil

Just look at everything on there, it's like reading a list made by a technology-naive teenager who watches too much Star Trek instead of understanding why things are even the way they are at the machine level. ""Oh, neural networks are a thing? We'll have brains as soon as computers are fast enough then!"" They're the same baseless extrapolations lacking a nuanced grasp on the reality of such technologies.

Some of the things he claims should be happening or are just about to in a year or two:

 - Most text will be generated from speech. Sorry, still wonky, a decade after he predicted it should be in vogue.
 - Intelligent roads and vehicles. Well, cars are getting there, a little, but definitely not back in 2009.
 - Nano robot/machines in 2009, hahaha. I doubt we'll see nanobots in our lifetime, considering that we are struggling just to get 10nm CPU fab down.
 - Retinal projection, when VR is going the way of Sony Move and Kinect: not going anywhere as-is and augmented reality, well, we know how Google Glass turned out.
 - We're supposed to use our computers via speech instead of keyboards, because we apparently also want them to be like interacting with people with virtual assistants, when Clippy is remembered fondly by all.
 - 3D nanotubes are the mainstream processor substrate. Lol, sounds cyberpunk.
 - Neural nets are in wide use. Sure, maybe in large server farms mining your data for targeted advertising, and Siri/Alexa, text-to-speech and image/face recognition, but they aren't in my house or day-to-day life.
 - DNA responsible for the brain is supposed to be used to develop brain-like neural networks. We still have little understanding as to how DNA actually makes what it makes, we've only deduced (the hard way) what genes are responsible for certain traits, but not how.
 - Nanotech is supposed to be like the movies.
 - Spinal coord injurees are not robotically ambulatory, or controlling their limbs with computers.
 - 'Haptic technology' is hardly a thing. Some people have explored various tech for achieving it but it's a long ways from mainstream, let alone desirability.
 - Household robots are *not* ubiquitous, or reliable.
 - Self-driving cars are coming into vogue, but we're a decade or two before human-driving is obsolete.
 - Roads do not have automated systems. There's automated RFID tolls, but 99.999999999999% of roads are still just roads.
 - Personal flying vehicles (hover cars! how quaint!) are non-existent, half a century later.
 - Interacting with virtual personalities is corny, and will not happen until machines learn like people do, from scratch.
 - A ""clean house"" is a far cry from being within the realm of automation/robotics.

The things he has gotten correct, for the most part, regardless of the timing, are obvious and derivative. Even then he has the wrong idea about what people want or need.

The data comparing it to the safety of current drivers is compiled over the last few years, not the entire history of driving. You can certainly make an argument that it should be marketed differently and I'd probably actually be inclined to agree with you if I had control over the marketing for it.

Arguing that they shouldn't release the software to the public yet is not something I can get behind. What is the line that we release that software at and when does it become more irresponsible to not release it than to release it. The current system seems to be about 2x better than your average driver and requires constant human monitoring to the best of Tesla's ability to require that. Should we wait until it is 5x better, I know their goal for level 4 and 5 autonomy is 10x better but that is a whole other level of control you are handing over to the car. At that point it is going to need to be so much better that it doesn't matter that we are no longer requiring human intervention to be available. As for now though do we wait 5 years to release the current 'autopilot' knowing that it will cost X number of lives if we do? 

You can see where the moral dilemma arises. I'm not going to try and defend marketing the system as self driving, even though I do think they make it pretty clear in car the limitations of the software. It's a hard choice to make however knowing that you can save lives today if you release this software and yet knowing that it is still not perfect and there may be some people who would have driven better without it.

&gt;1
&gt;:  a branch of computer science dealing with the &gt;simulation of intelligent behavior in computers
&gt;2
&gt;:  the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent &gt;human behavior

&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artificial%20intelligence

&gt;Gee, sounds pretty sentient to me. 

Spare me the sarcasm and pay attention. Definition 1 is what recent technological advances have used, and even definition 2 is not clear. Back in the 90s I was already studying neural networks (which are a form of AI) which one could train with input data to obtain desired results. I also knew about expert systems (a more primitive, logic based form of AI).

Just because the technology has started to become ubiquitous doesn't mean it's a buzzword. It's just what it is. 

If you want to get technical, you could also use ""machine learning"". Most AI news today are dealing with unsupervised learning, which is one of the most difficult problems in the AI field. 

Edit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence

&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence exhibited by machines. In computer science, the field of AI research defines itself as the study of ""intelligent agents"": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal.[1] Colloquially, the term ""artificial intelligence"" is applied when a machine mimics ""cognitive"" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as ""learning"" and ""problem solving"" (known as Machine Learning).[2] As machines become increasingly capable, mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition. For example, optical character recognition is no longer perceived as an exemplar of ""artificial intelligence"", having become a routine technology.[3]

&gt; Capabilities currently classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech,[4]competing at a high level in strategic game systems (such as Chess and Go[5]), self-driving cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and interpreting complex data.",1489768171,df21wnm,t1_df21745,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2017

But now that Uber has gotten past the legal challenges preventing it from operating in most cities, it has become the default for many people.

Have they though?  I'm not saying you're wrong but I think they still have lots of pushback and lots of cities that could still potentially obstruct, plus a taxi industry that remains unsatisfied. You could prove me wrong, but my impression is they still have hurdles ahead, don't they?


 &gt; Even if taxis clean up their game, I still have no incentive to switch. 

Well,let's consider that. If a taxi and Uber were equal service and price, but the taxi supports your local community while Uber provides a brash CEO and a culture of workplace discrimination, isn't that an incentive to choose one over the other?


&gt; What can taxis provide that is a step above? 

Well speaking for myself, I appreciate the fact that taxi companies obey local laws, they are forced to provide a certain number of handicapped cabs, they can't discriminate against riders, they have to operate video security cameras, they contribute to local tax revenues. Uber does none of that, instead redirecting that money resource to the personal wealth of their billionaire owners.

These attributes may not be direct benefits to me as a sole rider, but they are benefits to my community and mankind.

near the end of my ride today, we both stopped at an intersection with 4-way stop signs.

it apparently detected my presence (it's covered in Go-Pros) and stayed stationary for several seconds. it finally began to proceed, but as it did, I rolled forward an inch while still standing. the car immediately stopped...
I continued to stand, it continued to stay stopped. then as it began to move again, I had to rock the bike to maintain balance. it stopped abruptly.
we repeated this little dance for about 2 full minutes and the car never made it past the middle of the intersection. the two guys inside were laughing and punching stuff into a laptop, I guess trying to modify some code to 'teach' the car something about how to deal with the situation.

 I misquoted, it actually said ""Intelligent roads and *driverless* cars"", and this was meant to be back in 2009. We're just now scratching the surface.

    ""3D nanotubes are the mainstream processor substrate. Lol, sounds cyberpunk.""
    3D NAND has been a mainstay in consumer electronics since 2014 actually. Samsung is especially famous for being among the first to use it in thier tech.

 ""3D NAND"" just means the NAND logic-gates in silicon are stacked vertically for more capacity, and has *nothing* to do with nanotubes. Kurzweil was referring to microprocessors no longer being made out of photoetched silicon anymore, like this: http://www.kurzweilai.net/carbon-nanotubes-to-replace-silicon-ibm  But that is still years off and is *not* in widespread use yet like he 'predicts' it was going to be by now.

I predict that tall buildings referred to as 'skyscrapers' will exist in 20 years, and will be widespread in densely populated metropolitan areas. He was clearly referring to something along the line of a hover car, not a Cessna, because between the two the only one that didn't already exist at the time he made the prediction was the hover car. There's been all kinds of prototypes developed but they never seem to 'take off' and enter the mainstream. Take the Moller Skycar for instance, that thing has been around for 50 years. It's been on pre-order since 1990, and has yet to turn into anything. There's been others along the way, but they are always just novelties, another clip to add to ""the future is near"" videos.

408,pixl_graphix,"&gt;how far are we from cost parity between LARGE scale urban greenhouses and ""traditional"" farming?

Probably never. Property will always be cheaper in the country, and transportation will only be a small part of food costs. If there are large greenhouses, they'll be built on cheap land in the middle of nowhere with access to cheap water. 

&gt;Wouldn't we all be better off if we had a food system that was not dependent on good weather and a labor force in a given place?

We already have things, somewhat. There are enormous greenhouse complexes that exist already. A decent portion of our food already comes from them. They still require a lot of labor. But then we also have the majority of our food come from low labor sources. Grains like corn and wheat are mostly farmed by huge machines that only require one driver to plow, then plant, then harvest the crop. This part of it is being quickly automated by self driving tractors. This is why you can get a cheap loaf of bread for a dollar. 

&gt; If everyone was guarantied a healthy diet and housing provided by their local government

We kind of have this already. Just look at the last 60 years of farming in the US and the agricultural subsidies around it. Of course you have to look at the lobbying and any number of bad things that have happened too. Risk of starvation in the US is 'almost' non-existent. There are a lot of government programs to feed people, especially children of school age. These programs provide a lot of food security. At the same time these programs produce tons of grain which gets turned in to meat and high fructose corn syrup. Since the late '70s obesity has exploded in the US.

Look.  If one person can do it then the majority can as well.  The minority who legitimately can’t will be carried by the rest of us.  That is the point I am making.  I have no issue with those who can’t.  I have enormous issue with those who chose not to try at all.

&lt;The fact that some people manage to overcome the oppression of their surroundings does not mean that the oppression is not real, or that real tangible policy change isn't required to improve the situation&gt;

I was never told I was a victim from birth.  I was brought up with the logic that if you want something you work toward that goal.  I am a huge fan of The Wire.  After watching it several times I became sympathetic to the “poor disadvantaged” people of this country.  Then I watch the news and youtube and I see a lot of “disadvantaged” looking to tax the rich because the rich guy is steeling from them.  Blaming the rich is a cop out.  My opinions are migrating back to my old self.  

As far as robots taking over the labor force, I don’t see it happening.  My father owns a trucking company.  What he hauls could never be done by auto pilot.  Plus when the product gets to the customer, somebody needs to unload the truck.  The cost of 7 robot trucks would consume decades of gross income.  Not going to happen.  

I have been predicting the demise of the carburetor since 1987.  Fuel injection was going to take over as it was standard issue on most domestic cars back then.  It is 2017 and racers and hobbyists are still buying carburetors.  Racing will die before the carburetor does.  

If the robot apocalypse has any legitimacy what so ever, it will be decades before the population is affected in a meaningful way.  The generation of humans will have grown up in that world and as nature tends to do, will have adapted to that world.  Nobody is waking up tomorrow and finding out UPS fired the workforce and switched to self driving trucks and robot delivery men.  

Until then, if I were a young human, I would learn the history of employment in my area and choose a career of the future, not a career of the past.  I recommend battery technology and other power storage systems.  Aerospace usually pays well.  Of course there will always be a need for plumbers and electricians.

450,Hypothesis_Null,"Very true. If they differentiate it (ie, don't assume everyone does both), driving manual will cost more than driving automatic.

But I doubt that will make people refuse to drive.  Actually for legal and safety reasons, I assume that all people will drive manual *some* of the time.  

So my guess is insurance will look the same, but people *with* autonomous cars will receive a flat discount under the assumption that they will use it.

As a general point, I don't think it will be likely that self-driving cars will be cheaper than having your own.

Gas costs being equal, you still have to take into account wear and tear and maintenance.  Cars tend to have 10 year, 100,000 mi warranties these days.

If we assume that to be the lifetime of the car, then a $10,000 car costs $0.10 a mile to drive (and replace if it's part of a fleet).  Now, taking care of the car can help it extend its life to double that. But on-call cars are going to do a lot of extra driving to first go and pick you up.  And they won't be treated as nice by people who don't own it. And especially if they're autonomous, you're going to be running them all day every day, which is probably worse for the car, being hot all the time.

I can certainly see people living in dense cities forgoing owning a car. Many do already. But not in the suburbs and definitely not in the rural areas.

People will still own their own cars.  People will still drive their own cars.  Automation will be nice to have once you get on to main roads and set routes, and will likely pull down crash rates and insurance rates significantly.  But it's not going to make manual driving obsolete.

459,BlinksTale,"Hey! I learned a bunch of interesting things, but I've spent way too long researching and know I won't have time for a proper reply. But you got me to learn some stuff, so ty!

1) I wanted to reference cord cutting as a [similar shakeup](http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/22/8466845/cable-tv-unbundling-verizon-espn-apple), but while it's incredibly bad, it's not even a majority yet. People spend more time on apps than watching TV, but they still spend more time watching TV than watching streaming. Americans watch [5hrs of TV a day](http://www.recode.net/2016/6/27/12041028/tv-hours-per-week-nielsen). Younger folks are at 2hrs/day, but [Netflix is 90min still](http://time.com/4186137/netflix-hours-per-day/). That's a huge chunk, but that war is far from over. Like the smartphone comment, this was just to reply to your ""I don't see how you expect all of these self driving cars to appear out of thin air to meet the demands of consumers in 20 years"" comment.

2) I should have said 95% in 25 years! The [USA Today article](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/07/29/new-car-sales-soaring-but-cars-getting-older-too/30821191/) on those numbers you posted tell a very different story - out of 250ish mil cars on the road, only 14mil are 25+yrs old. The 16-24yr range is 44mil, so my numbers for 20yr old cars are likely wrong (it's probably closer to 10%).

3) Rural folks as individuals drive more than suburb or urban folks, shows a [AAA study](http://newsroom.aaa.com/2015/04/new-study-reveals-much-motorists-drive/), but I could find what percentage of driving was urban vs rural (which is what matters more for total impact). I was looking for this to show how ride sharing's investment in SDCs would impact its presence, and also how how many miles ridesharing driving went each year, but I couldn't find any of that! So I can't do much to predict the future that way.

I hope you found that interesting or useful, I'm glad you pushed me to back up my numbers since they were gut initially, and faltered a bit. I still think most cars will be self driving in 2042 by a huge majority given the numbers on how old most cars are, but the television market numbers make it seem like everything is slower to change than I thought.

1.more frequent upgrades. Obviously most people can't justify getting a new car every year, but I think that those that can will be more likely to do so with self driving cars, because they'll become more than just a means of locomotion. If all you want is a dependable car, then there is little difference between getting a 2017 model and say a 2015 model. But on the entertainment/vehicle as a place to hang side, there may be a large difference between the 2022 model with 3D audio, the 2023 model with a 4k entertainment system, and the 2024 version with total VR. Similarly, cars could act as mobile offices, so there could be incentive to upgrade more frequently as mobile Internet, audio quality, computer power, and usability as an office and maybe even bed for long business trips improve.   
2. Government pressure. From a government point of view, there is not a lot to gain from getting people to upgrade from 2000 car to a 2017 car.

I admit that they have come a long way, but as it is there are still a lot of challenges to overcome. Enough that in the 20 year timeline they won't be the only cars on the road. We'll see them adopted slowly over time like any new technology. First by the wealthy and industries, and then over a much more gradual timescale they will be widely available. Even so there are conditions and applications which a completely SDC will never be able to handle. How do you get a SDC to park just *there* or drive through a muddy field? What if you want to park it under your car port but it's not mapped? How does it handle a private drive, or roads that are hardly even on Google maps? (if correct at all) There are just some things to consider before everyone jumps up and screams for human drivers to be illegal. If anything SDC's should *always* have human steering as a backup, and sleeping behind the wheel should result in a loss of your ability to operate a motor vehicle under any circumstances. Really, they should be sold with a ""dead mans switch"" that must be pressed every x seconds to ensure the driver is aware.

That's in an open field where you just have to go back and forth in a straight line. It doesn't give me much confidence in a car going way faster under much more dangerous conditions. Google it if you'd like, you'll find all sorts of forums filled with self driving tractor issues.

It's just a simple, unarguable statistical fact that younger drivers are not as safe as older drivers. Ask any insurance company - and they absolutely care. Same as women being safer than men.

To the point where you have to be around 80 before your risk goes back to being equal to that of a young driver.

481,8168343523,"&gt; Why would the insurance go up though?

Same reason it goes up and up for young drivers because you'd become a massive and unnecessary risk compared with the main.

Not the least, of course, because as automated cars get more and more prevalent the volume of data showing just how bad humans are at driving will be there. Imagine every dick move you've ever made in a vehicle being displayed on a screen at your insurance company.

With automated car manufacturers, clearly, having a massive interest and investment in proving their vehicle was not at fault - you'd better drive safely because they will throw a ton of money and resources at proving their vehicles, especially earlier on when the spotlight is on them.

These days only relatively few car collisions are reported widely. Self-driving cars though have every incident, close pass of a cyclist or foobar in the press. Clearly SDC have to prove themselves - and as the OP suggests their main goal is proving they are better than you.

Many drivers currently avoid much more than tit-for-tat accounting after an accident, because of a lack of data and reliable eye witnesses and so on and because insurance companies aren't going to spend a ton of resources investigating every last claim. It's not cost effective.

Imagine a future where your insurance company insists that, even if you drive, your car must be equipped with the same equipment as a SDC to measure and record - if you don't have that, expect a huge premium - tens of thousands of dollars or more. Eventually imagine where 20%, then 30%, maybe 50% and higher of the cars around you are measuring every thing your vehicle does anyway. Every risky overtake. Every guy you cut up. Every stop sign you didn't stop at, some car recorded it and reported back.

Right now, if you drive like most people, you're probably driven by 2 factors ""selfishness and impatience"" - anyone that assumes other road users are selfish and impatient can typically predict behavior.

That is risky though, that leads to a ton of collisions including many seriously injured or killed.

If the roads are full of cars where that, more or less, doesn't happen, you'll be paying for nearly all the risk and they'll either have a ton of data to tell them or to opt not to collect data they'll make it so expensive that only the richest could possibly afford it.

They already do this with young drivers now in the UK - collect data as they drive which, if they drive badly enough, can lead to them losing their insurance cover.

i.e, you won't even have to be in a collision in the future, just driving like a dick will cost you more and more.

And let's face it, most people that profess they ""like driving"" typically like things that all this scrutiny will make very, very expensive or stamp it out completely. i.e if your attitude to driving channels a Jeremy Clarkson stereotype then you really won't enjoy driving in the future. You may as well sit in the back and let the car drive - because if you channel your inner JC in the future the insurance company will say ""Nope""",1490357403,dfchwo3,t1_dfbeqni,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2017

I don't think self-driving cars will ever be mandatory, but manual cars will be simply priced out of the market for 90% of everyone.  And the remaining 10% won't find it fun to drive anymore for their daily commute, so their'll only drive on car parks/private roads.  Maybe we'll see self-driving only highways, like we do right now with motor powered only highways.

There are a bunch of examples of where a self-driving car would pay for itself almost immediately, but the one I'm most excited about is traveling.  A self-driving car basically eliminates road trips that are under 12 hours long.  Get off of work on Friday, go home, eat dinner, have a drink and then get in your self-driving car, set the destination for 12 hours away, watch a movie, maybe have another drink, fall asleep for 8 hours, wake up the next day, drink some coffee, have some breakfast, maybe get a little work done and then arrival at your destination that's 700 miles away, along with your car, early on Saturday.  Spend the entire weekend doing whatever, and then do the whole thing again Sunday night.

Depending on what a self-driving car cost (the Tesla model 3 is only $35k), the value added of having a personal, robot chauffeur is going to push manual cars out of the market much faster than simply their life span.  I have a couple of old flip phones in drawers that still work, but once smart phones came to market, the value they added to my quality of life was worth the extra cost immediately.

Insurance premiums don't exist in a vacuum.  High relative risk does not mean increased premium.  The entire business of insurance exists to cover risk.  If there's no risk, there's no business case for insurance.

&gt; decreased volume of policies to pool your risk

You don't need a giant pool for insurance to work.  You just need it to be large enough for statistical tools to work.  And that number is smaller than you think.

&gt; rising costs of repairs

Already happened due to complexity of modern cars.  But premiums are still alright.

The main reason insurers hike premiums is to cover potential payout from much higher risk of crashing and still make some profit. For example a pool of 1000 similar cars with similar drivers over a 1yr period statistically causes $1 million in claims. To make a 20% gross profit you'd want to charge them each $1,200/yr in premiums which is a pretty typical rate today. Now many claim after introduction of self-driving cars that premiums will become ""prohibitively expensive"" due to ""high risk"". Let's assume that is tripled to $3,600/yr. Still not prohibitive but whatever.  That implies the same pool is now expected to cause 3x the damage, simply because self-driving cars are here.

&gt;More people working means more is produced and supply increases to match demand negating inflationary pressures. 

Alright, but when service jobs start disappearing, leaving only the higher skilled jobs, which aren't ever in demand as much as lower skill by virtue of specialization in need and production (everyone needs food, ergo you're gonna have a very diluted food worker pool, but not everyone needs an aerospace engineer, as a comparative example), how do you think heightened production will be achieved? Because, let's face, our productivity levels have fucking *skyrocketed* in the last few decades, even though the workforce has remained relatively constant with employment levels. Hmm, I wonder what the difference is between the production tendencies of the postwar boom and today... /s

So basically, you assert this without qualifying it. 

&gt;A UBI doesn't increase supply as a UBI has no effect on productivity, only working labor does. Perhaps one could solve this by eliminating the minimum wage in conjunction with the UBI to counteract inflationary pressures by decreasing the cost of labor. You can imagine the political nightmare that would pose though. 

No one suggested it increases supply, since its stated purpose revolves around quality of life and consumption, not production. It will affect supply in that people will purchase goods, having a positive economic ripple effect, but no one is even remotely insinuating that a UBI helps with production. So your entire point is misplaced. 

&gt;People have been bemoaning automation putting masses of people out of work for longer then we've been alive and the same percentage of people are still in the labor pool. We don't know what comes after the service sector yet because it hasn't emerged, to say there will be nothing following the service sector migration would be ignorant. 

Well, yeah, because it has had pretty damaging effects. The same people are employed, roughly, but now they have shittier jobs with shittier benefits and shittier pay doing something outside of the realm of manufacturing they were trained for (because it's manufacturing that has felt this shift first). But what happens when retail is largely automated? When restaraunts can prepare, cook, and serve with minimal human interaction? When truck drivers are replaced by self driving semis? Every job in every industry is at risk. When automation first began decades ago, the systems used are hilariously simple by comparison. I'm not saying I know what the future holds, but to reiterate: *suggesting that the evolution of robotics and AI will not have a negative effect on people's ability to find work in the future is as asinine as it is ignorant*. 

&gt;The amount of influx of money for immediate consumption would dwarf welfare and other direct aid provided currently. And that aid is currently within the velocity we are experiencing, a UBI would be purely additive without providing additional production to curb demand increases to stem inflation. 

Welfare costs the U.S. approximately [close to $700 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/01/12/no-we-dont-spend-1-trillion-on-welfare-each-year/?utm_term=.881102f195fe) annually, and while yes, this program would dwarf current welfare efforts, it could come in the form if negative income tax credits for the middle class and poor, or even be tied to some kind of community service or research program. The benefits could be far-reaching, it depends on how it's implemented. A straight check would be nice, but hard to politically justify without significant cuts to programs other than what it's replacing (which is welfare, writ large). And production changes occur with changes in demand, that's is it a weird point to make. ",1490388211,dfd7mt3,t1_dfd5wlo,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2017

-- LCD, LED, and OLED screens of increasingly large screen sizes, increasingly thin, and increasing pixel densities

-- E-ink

-- Modern Lithiom-Ion batteries. (battery tech has advanced A LOT in the last 20 years but it tends to get overlooked because it was slow and steady)

-- Drones of all types

-- Voice recognition (it was still a joke even as recently as 2011 or so, has advaced massively thinks to advances in Deep Learning)

-- Personal Digital Assistants

-- Deep Learning and the ongoing AI revolution in general(software defeating the best human players at Jeopardy and Go being a couple of key milestones of this revolution)

-- capacitive touch screens (how quickly we forgot that this was a MASSIVE breakthrough that didn't really enter the mainstream until 2008-ish with the first iphones and the early Androids, etc.)
They had existed earlier but were expensive and crappy

-- smart phones and modern tablets

-- video calling (took longer than expected and no one predicted it would be mobile video phones that would make it go mainstream)

-- Truly reusable rockets 

-- Hybrid and then All-Electric cars

-- Self-Driving Cars (commercial cars available now have up to level 3 and level 4 self-driving capability)

-- mass SSD storage

-- streaming video/audio services

-- google, social media, etc 

-- cheap genetic analysis available at the consumer level (23 and Me, etc.)

-- personalized medical treatments based on genetic analysis 

-- radical new cancer therapies (immune therapy now commercially available, though still VERY expensive)

35,hole_da_door,"Hmm, at the global level, I'd argue that competition is still needed to drive innovation for now. A lot of advancements come from industrializing something that's developed at a lab-scale. Intel, for instance, has been able to develop 7nm transistors (maybe 5 nm, I can't remember exactly), but they haven't yet unveiled a manufacturing process (that I'm aware of) that can output them at a high rate. And it's hard to say that it would or would not develop a manufacturing process had competition been removed from the equation. 

There may be an upper limit to our tech that we are approaching, but it should also be noted that advancement isn't smoothly exponential. It's more like a stair case, where you have a turning point discovery or invention that drives rapid innovation long after the initial discovery. E.g. steam engine, transistors, vaccines, Internet, numerous theoretical discoveries that still have research being conducted to implement them practically. 

If things seem slow now, just remember that 10 years ago smartphones weren't the norm, 3D printing houses didn't have widespread notoriety, the IoT wasn't really thought of (good or bad, it's impressive that we have actual virtual assistants that could run the house accessible to the rank and file), self-driving cars seemed far-off.

56,ForeskinLamp,"It's mostly the echo chamber effect created by advertising. There's a lot of hype around new tech, because research organizations are looking for funding. Tech media wants clicks for advertising money, and so they run with the biggest headline they can manage. It's a symbiotic relationship that benefits everyone except for the casual reader who is interested in tech. In reality, we've reached a point of diminishing returns on investment in research. Every breakthrough now costs more in the way of funding and man hours than previous breakthroughs, and this is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.

As someone who works in AI research, you need to read articles with a critical mindset. I've seen AI papers that are almost 30 years old with results that would blow people away today, which is a good indication that progress isn't as fast as some people might think. I also read articles here on a daily basis that are laughably wrong or misinformed. We've come a long way, but the hype is far beyond the ability of current technology to deliver, which is a problem, and why there's a lot of push back. AI research has already been through two hype cycles that resulted in funding collapses (known as the first and second AI winters), so a lot of researchers are fighting against the current wave of hype. It's actually created a crisis in the field, in the form of compromised peer review standards, lack of reproducibility, code not getting released, etc. 

For all we've been hearing about self-driving cars, it's taken Google a decade to get them out onto the road, and it'll probably be another decade before all of the bugs are ironed out, and they become a common thing. Electric cars are in a similar boat -- they still comprise about 1% of total car sales, and it'll probably take a decade or so for them to filter into the economy (the average car is around 11 years old). Solar? Sure, it's catching on, and it makes a lot of sense in some areas. China is often paraded around these parts as being some champion of solar and wind, when in reality, their renewable energy mix is 20% hydro, 2% wind, and 1% solar.

Don't take everything you read on here at face value.

Most people live in parts of the country where commuting longer than 30 minutes won't help them find a better job or a cheaper house.  There is no point to going further.

In cities with high-paying jobs like New York, people already commute 1 hour each way on average.  And if you're poor and you need affordable housing, 2 hours each way is not uncommon.  In those cities, you can't discount the fact that there are already plenty of trains and bus networks that have been offering commuters a ""driver-free"" experience for decades.

I think you're somewhat naive in thinking you'll be able to find a secluded mountain home within a 2 hour commute of any job that is worth commuting 2 hours for.

That's why I think the real story will be for the people who realize that they don't need a brick-and-mortar home anymore.  They'll be the ones who can actually live affordably within a reasonable commuting distance to any job they want. 

&gt; Mobile homes entire design principle is that it's a mobile home, not that it has a driver... 

No, it's that it has one and only one driver.  That is a serious design constraint.

What you'll see is exactly what OP says. American households already own 2.28 cars on average.  Instead of marketing giant motor homes, you'll see vendors selling more specialized gear such as a towable or self-driving bathroom trailer.  You won't need to outfit your ""bathroom"" or ""kitchen"" with a driver's seat or a passenger's seat.  You'll just stick a couple lightweight trailers on the cars you already own and caravan it out to Yosemite with the vehicles you already own.  You'll have a level of flexibility that was never possible for mobile homes.  Need an extra bedroom because you're taking your kids with you?  Just buy an extra self-driving bedroom instead of having to upgrade a small motorhome to the next larger model.

59,izumi3682,"Over and over I see these ""contrarian"" viewpoints concerning the development of AI and AGI and ""deep learning"" and ""machine learning"" and whatnot.

The arguments sound to me, a complete layman, to be very convincing and causes me at times to wonder if we will *ever* develop this or that technology to include all the many forms of AI.

And yet...

The development goes on. Despite what the naysayers say, fantastic new improvements continue. I was just wondering at what point ""AlphaGoZero"" was at in learning to play ""StarCraft 2"" with the ultimate goal of beating all humans at that game. A game that requires an astronomical increase in the number of variables to be understood and accounted for, compared to something like ""Go"" which has a very limited number of variables to be navigated. 

Then of course a newer form of ""AlphaGo"" came along and blew *it* out of the water within I think they said, 45 days compared to the 2 or 3 years the first ""AlphaGo"" took to be able to function competently.


 But even ""Go"" can't be beaten with sheer brute computation and demands a certain indefinable form of what humans call ""intuition"".     A trait that ""AlphaGo"" demonstrated with frighteningly accurate simulation. I have not seen any recent news concerning this use of ""AlphaGoZero"" to learn ""StarCraft 2"". The latest development I am aware of is that the AI was not yet able to beat the *lowest* level game AI that is used to tutor *humans* to play the game.  And it is going to beat all humans? A lofty goal indeed!



Someone ELI5 *why* the ""experts"" and I mean ""'experts'"" in the sense that they truly *are* the experts in these fields, are continuously being surprised by the achievements of the AI they themselves are developing. How do they so vastly underestimate what the performance of any given form of AI ends up being.  Why did the experts in AI state unequivocally in 2010 that *no* AI will beat a human at the game of ""Go"" until the year 2050, yet by the year 2017 it was all said and done. I almost forgot about the ""black box"" phenomenon. What on earth is *that* about. The narrow AI is doing some inscrutable things to get our results? Is the ""black box"" getting ""bigger""? I need some answers for that too.

Like Ben Goertzal states, I think it might be a better idea to *overestimate* what the AI is going to do, because being forewarned is being forearmed. Shoot, just think about the state that so-called ""self-driving"" cars were at in the year 2012. It was laughable that SDVs were going to be on the roads in less than 50-100 years! Serious, highly educated and knowledgeable experts said as much. The major automotive manufacturers wouldn't touch the concept with a ten foot pole. Well how times have changed in 6 *very* short years. This is not about cars, or batteries or even the massive improvements in mapping and tracking. This is about the exponentially improving intrinsic AI within the vehicles themselves. Don't even get me started on back-flipping robots that can execute biologically indistinguishable micro-corrections in bipedal balance. Imagine *that* in 2012! Narrow AI.

The AI isn't really even ""I"" is the most common sentiment. That's true. I understand how the narrow AI works, but there is something else going on too. That is the again *exponentially* improving processing power and data capacity of our computers. It is also the spread what 7 years ago were the most powerful supercomputers in the world limited to one or two per country to hundreds now, maybe thousands. No not thousands *yet*, but definitely hundreds. These are computers that can operate at between 6-12 petaflops of power. I think this sort of power is trickling down into our mobiles now. My little IPhone X is more powerful than the best supercomputer in the *world* in the year say, 1991. That computer cost about a billion dollars. My IPhone cost about a 1000. And the narrow AI is coming *right* along with it.

Nothing exists in a vacuum of it's own. This cumulative processing power now enables incredible new iterations of narrow AI to exist. This narrow AI makes the development of superior forms of material science to make even better forms of computers like *quantum* computers to come into existence. Could we have made a quantum computer in 2008?

Tell me, is it possible that if you have enough algorithms combined with a fast enough processor and enough data that a ""narrow"" AI could perhaps *simulate* the behavior of AGI. Or would that just be straight AGI then. Or would such a distinction matter? What is it about my mixture of partially informed and blithely naïve exposition makes you think I am a human writing this rather than a ""clever"" AI. A clever AI could do what I do.  A *very* clever AI could make us look like *Archaea""* by comparison. It does not have to be self-aware or conscious to accomplish this. It just needs to compute, like our brains compute. But *better*.

I have one final thought, or prophesy if you like. The time of ""AI winters"" is no longer possible. What took 10 years or longer to figure out, now takes about a *year* to figure out, tops. Ray Kurzweil is correct. Even despite the ending of ""Moore's Law"" in a strict sense, the continuous developments of workarounds and just plain new technologies demonstrates to me that we are probably past the bend of the AI advancement ""knee curve"" and likely moving towards the straight up portion in less than 20 years. That, BTW is why there is all this talk about a so-called ""technological singularity"" in less than 30 years. What is 30 years compared to the previous 3000?

60,djaeveloplyse,"&gt; Most people live in parts of the country where commuting longer than 30 minutes won't help them find a better job or a cheaper house. There is no point to going further.

That is simply not true. You're the one who has the misleading personal experience, not me. Most jobs are in cities, and a 2 hour drive is plenty long enough to escape the high demand pricing hikes of housing within those cities, where 30 minutes is often not enough to even get halfway out of the metropolitan area. There are a few exceptions where you can be stuck in traffic for 2 hours and still not leave the city, like New York and LA, but for the most part a 2 hour drive is enough to get a long way out.

&gt; you can't discount the fact that there are already plenty of trains and bus networks that have been offering commuters a ""driver-free"" experience for decades.

Of course I can. Cars offer far more freedom than public transport, and a self-driving car would be radically superior to public transport.

&gt; I think you're somewhat naive in thinking you'll be able to find a secluded mountain home within a 2 hour commute of any job that is worth commuting 2 hours for.

I wasn't making up numbers, I literally live a 2 hour drive from a whole pile of secluded mountain villages in 3 directions where housing is considerably cheaper than where I currently live. As well, the ""worth"" of making the commute is being changed dramatically by the fact I would not be driving, but doing my own thing, like playing video games, for instance.

&gt; No, it's that it has one and only one driver. That is a serious design constraint.

I think you misunderstand the phrase ""entire design principle."" All road vehicles have one and only one driver, so the ""entire design principle"" of a mobile home cannot possibly be exactly the same as the ""entire design principle"" of all other road vehicles. For a mobile home to be a mobile home, rather than a bus, or a van, or a car, or a truck, all of which have one and only one driver, it must have home-like accommodations. THAT is the ""entire design principle."" If you want to switch to ""design constraint"" fine, but yeah, no shit man, that's my point. Having to drive sucks, so having a computer do the driving makes road transportation radically more enjoyable. Removing the constraint of having to drive makes motorhomes considerably more appealing.

&gt; you'll see vendors selling more specialized gear such as a towable or self-driving bathroom trailer.

That is so impractical I can hardly believe you said it. Self driving bathrooms? Dude. The rest of that paragraph is just as ludicrous. What you're describing would be radically more expensive than just staying at a hotel. You would never bother to rent an extra self driving bedroom to follow your car, you'd just stay at a hotel like we already do- which is renting an extra bedroom that's *already at the destination*.",1520610459,dvfob7b,t1_dvfk71l,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2018
61,OneTaoThree,"I agree with you on the biotech issues but not the rest. AI is close. Frighteningly close. The supercomputer that was just recently created at Stanford https://hypernetwork.io is just one example of the leaps and bounds we’re making in computing power. The iPhone in my pocket is three times more powerful than the one I had before it, and that one was three time more powerful than its predecessor. Self driving cars are happening *now*. Within five years they’ll be as common on the roads as hybrids were in 2005, and you won’t even know which ones are driving themselves.

Here’s the thing: We’re approaching the technological singularity, the point at which AI becomes more intelligent than humans, and we’re approaching it quickly. Once that happens, humans and all other biological life will simply be the pets of the machines. If we wrote our code right on the way up, AI won’t wipe out biological life. If we didn’t, the Skynet scenario from Terminator films is going to look like a Disney cartoon by comparison.

Another thing we are making frightening levels of progress on are robot soldiers that will be able to climb or even jump over buildings, crash through walls and windows without getting hurt, engage a target with split-second speed and pinpoint accuracy, take measurements and make target trajectory calculations in tenths of a second, carry five times the ammunition and heavier weapons than biological soldiers can carry, and not have that pesky need to eat or sleep.

If we were to put the policy in place, in the short term employment would likely not be affected too much at all.  People would keep working and use the extra money to pay down debts, buy things they have been putting off, visit doctors, and fix up things around their houses.

In the medium term though, yes, those places would indeed lose workers.  And they would be replaced either by automation or by offering better wages to do shitty jobs.  Right now the entirety of the economy is controlled by the rich.  They will make you scrub human waste out of toilets for 8 hours straight for pennies and if you complain about it for one second, they'll fire you and hire someone else.

Soon as you can just walk out of a job that's mistreating you and not have to worry about starving while you find another one, suddenly the employee starts having that power.  Businesses still need labor to continue to function, but now that labor doesn't need the business to avoid their family starving.  Now the employee can afford to value itself and the companies will have to start adding wage hikes or benefits to attract staff.

Some industries who are cemented in place with virtual monopolies might be able to pass some of those extra costs off, but for the most part the price of goods and services are set and if someone tries to price hike they will be shut out through competition from other businesses willing to simply take a smaller piece of the profits.

Of course that's very simplified.  It's a radical change and will require a lot of planning by a lot of people to be implemented with any chance of success.  But it is also necessary I think to progress past this point in our society without creating a lot of needless suffering.

Crowdsourcing.  If it costs $50,000 to buy a robot that plants, tends, and harvests enough food to feed 1000 people, then those 1000 people can drop $50 to go in on it together and have free food delivered free to their doorstop for decades without paying a dime.

Localization is where the future is going.  You'll see communities banding together and buying buildings in their areas to make farms/labs to grow food/meat in and crowdsourcing the robots and self-driving vehicles to distribute it.

It will cost the citizens very little compared to what they're spending already on that stuff and they will have even more money to crowdsource the next thing (say, automating the water plant with robots so that no one has to pay a water bill, or buying solar panels to get rid of their power bill, which again gives them more money to spend on even more community improvements).

This automation race will continue until everyone in a community has their basic needs taken care of free of cost across the board.

https://www.rethinkx.com/
video presentation of research paper https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b3ttqYDwF0&amp;t=694s

1.) as mentioned previously the economics and amenities of self-driving cars is going to be very compelling.  a single person ride in a car will be only 10 cents per mile, but shared rides will be much cheaper.  there will be shared rides in cars, shuttles, and buses that will cost 3-5 cents per mile.  self-driving shuttles and buses are going to be so much faster than they are today.  essentially buses will be closer to quality metro lines we have today.  They will run more frequently and faster.  Additionally, their schedules will be reliable and easy to understand.  you will just give a verbal command to your smart device(phone, watch, glasses, maybe an implant in your body), and your device will give you step by step directions.  Transportation will become so advanced, simple, enjoyable, affordable, etc that many businesses will offer it for free.  Stores, restaurants, and all types of businesses will essentially validate transportation similar to how parking is validated.  This cost to businesses will be so much less than the current costs of building and maintaining parking lots.  Cities will give incentives to businesses to do this in exchange for drastically reducing parking requirements.

2.) gasoline cars are going to become progressively more expensive and difficult to fuel, maintain, repair.  Gas, maintenance and repair stations will start to disappear.  you will not be able to get parts for many cars because demand will fall so that suppliers will not be able to make a profit.  An electric car has only 18 moving parts compared to a gas car which has 2,000.  people may have the option to buy their own EVs, but cities, regions, states, countries will start to ban human-driven cars.

3.)  the safety of self-driving cars is going to become very compelling.

4.) traffic will get much better with self-driving cars.

5.)  any city, state, region, or country that does not move to highly organized automated transition is going to be at a serious economic disadvantage.  by sheer economics, people are continually going to relocate to cities in order to find dwindling work due to automation.  This transition (disruption) will start slow but it will accelerate exponentially.  Essentially, the whole world is going to change around people.

128,izumi3682,"No. Wrong.

Over and over I see these ""contrarian"" viewpoints concerning the development of AI and AGI and ""deep learning"" and ""machine learning"" and whatnot.

The arguments sound to me, a complete layman, to be very convincing and causes me at times to wonder if we will *ever* develop this or that technology to include all the many forms of AI.

And yet...

The development goes on. Despite what the naysayers say, fantastic new improvements continue. I was just wondering at what point ""AlphaGoZero"" was at in learning to play ""StarCraft 2"" with the ultimate goal of beating all humans at that game. A game that requires an astronomical increase in the number of variables to be understood and accounted for, compared to something like ""Go"" which has a very limited number of variables to be navigated. But even ""Go"" can't be beaten with sheer brute computation and demands a certain indefinable form of what humans call ""intuition"". A trait that ""AlphaGo"" demonstrated with frighteningly accurate simulation. 

Then of course a newer form of ""AlphaGo"" came along and blew it out of the water within I think they said, 45 days compared to the 2 or 3 years the first ""AlphaGo"" took to be able to function competently.

I have not seen any recent news concerning this use of ""AlphaGoZero"" to learn ""StarCraft 2"". The latest development I am aware of is that the AI was not yet able to beat the lowest level game AI that is used to tutor *humans* to play the game. And it is going to beat all humans? A lofty goal indeed!

Someone ELI5 why the ""experts"" and I mean ""'experts'"" in the sense that they truly are the experts in these fields, are continuously being surprised by the achievements of the AI they themselves are developing. How do they so vastly underestimate what the performance of any given form of AI ends up being. Why did the experts in AI state unequivocally in 2010 that no AI will beat a human at the game of ""Go"" until the year 2050, yet by the year 2017 it was all said and done. I almost forgot about the ""black box"" phenomenon. What on earth is that about. The narrow AI is doing some inscrutable things to get our results? Is the ""black box"" getting ""bigger""? I need some answers for that too.

Like Ben Goertzal states, I think it might be a better idea to overestimate what the AI is going to do, because being forewarned is being forearmed. Shoot, just think about the state that so-called ""self-driving"" cars were at in the year 2012. It was laughable that SDVs were going to be on the roads in less than 50-100 years! Serious, highly educated and knowledgeable experts said as much. The major automotive manufacturers wouldn't touch the concept with a ten foot pole. Well how times have changed in 6 very short years. This is not about cars, or batteries or even the massive improvements in mapping and tracking. This is about the exponentially improving intrinsic AI within the vehicles themselves. Don't even get me started on back-flipping robots that can execute biologically indistinguishable micro-corrections in bipedal balance. Imagine that in 2012! Narrow AI.

The AI isn't really even ""I"" is the most common sentiment. That's true. I understand how the narrow AI works, but there is something else going on too. That is the again exponentially improving processing power and data capacity of our computers. It is also the spread what 7 years ago were the most powerful supercomputers in the world limited to one or two per country to hundreds now, maybe thousands. No not thousands yet, but definitely hundreds. These are computers that can operate at between 6-12 petaflops of power. I think this sort of power is trickling down into our mobiles now. My little IPhone X is more powerful than the best supercomputer in the world in the year say, 1991. That computer cost about a billion dollars. My IPhone cost about a 1000. And the narrow AI is coming *right* along with it.

Nothing exists in a vacuum of it's own. This cumulative processing power now enables incredible new iterations of narrow AI to exist. This narrow AI makes the development of superior forms of material science to make even better forms of computers like quantum computers to come into existence. Could we have made a quantum computer in 2008?

Tell me, is it possible that if you have enough algorithms combined with a fast enough processor and enough data that a ""narrow"" AI could perhaps simulate the behavior of AGI. Or would that just be straight AGI then. Or would such a distinction matter? What is it about my mixture of partially informed and blithely naïve exposition makes you think I am a human writing this rather than a ""clever"" AI. A clever AI could do what I do. A very clever AI could make us look like *""Archaea""* by comparison. It does not have to be self-aware or conscious to accomplish this. It just needs to compute, like our brains compute. But *better*.

I have one final thought, or prophesy if you like. The time of ""AI winters"" is no longer possible. What took 10 years or longer to figure out, now takes about a year to figure out, tops. Ray Kurzweil is correct. Even despite the ending of ""Moore's Law"" in a strict sense, the continuous developments of workarounds and just plain new technologies demonstrates to me that we are probably past the bend of the AI advancement ""knee curve"" and likely moving towards the straight up portion in less than 20 years. That, BTW is why there is all this talk about a so-called ""technological singularity"" in less than 30 years. What is 30 years compared to the previous 3000?

Example: how well does a self driving car negotiate a terrible B road with changing surface conditions during twilight hours when visibility can be difficult. Can it negotiate driving through a herd of cattle that are grazing the easement of that B road. 

My point there are actually so many situations where judgement calls are made based on principles and 99% of the time we humans probably get it right, but you only hear about the 1% that get it wrong. 

Whilst i understand self driving in the City is a big bonus, out in the country where i live roads aren't so well defined and aren't in great condition.

There is no mentions of General Motors at all in that article. How can you make a claim about General Motors then not even post a source that talks about them? And it's a huge false claim. They will not be mass producing autonomous cars next year. 

If you read the article it talks about the levels of autonomous driving. Most car manufacturers don't plan to get above level 3 in those plans. Every car has level 1 (cruise control) and some cars have level 2 (automatic braking, pilot assist, etc.) to be fully autonomous to the point that you don't need to pay attention you have to reach level 5. Currently Audi is the only manufacturer that offers level 3 and that's basically just autonomous driving in traffic jams. The leap from level 3 to 4 is exponential, as well as the leap from level 4 to 5; which is probably even more exponential.

So to me it still seems iffy, even if the stuff looks like it works well enough while new. And as it is now, none of that stuff beats a certain threshold on the used car market. (At least where the population density isn't high enough to warrant a rental or taxi fleet operator. But even at their rates, they still may not beat the yearly cost of an older used but reliable car.)",1521089811,dvq61xj,t1_dvnirl1,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2018

The machines that offload them -automated. 

Most processing plants require very little human activity that can’t be replaced by a robot arm and a sensor with an AI.  Load those materials with an automated forklift into a self driving truck.  

Arriving at the next factory things will be pretty much the same.  

Amazon already has mostly automated storage warehouses.  

There are machines that are 3D printing buildings.  AIs that are designing buildings.  And you can apply for the permits to do so online.  

Computers and robots are built in mostly automated factories because of the complexity of the tasks.  
Right now the only factors that include people is when the cost to build a machine to do the work is higher then the cost of a human component.  
Machines will soon begin buildings and designing better machines.  Then building them.   Computers and automated production is one of the few industries that won’t need to employ more workers to expand its market.

What many of the people who are predicting the fall of humans and the rise of AI are referring to is Strong AI or General AI.  This is different than what you have mentioned.  Strong AI works just like human intelligence.  It for lack of a better term ""thinks"".  It also has the potential to become exponentially more intelligent.  Imagine every worker being as smart as Einstein or smarter with instant access to any piece of information and the ability to process it all in parallel. That is what the future General AI worker looks like.  Also, they never get sick, never need time off, never forget and have networked institutional knowledge of every worker that has ever done any task.

If it's just robots then that is problematic for humanity, but there will still be some human jobs.  If Strong AI replaces workers there aren't going to be any jobs for humans.  The AI will just be better and faster at everything.  For an analog, think of self driving cars.  If that technology winds up emerging with a near perfect driving record, it will look like any human electing to drive is putting everyone at risk.

Not really. Lots of jobs are very difficult to automate. While something being repetitive makes it a good *candidate* for automation, there's actually more issues than just that.

Look at construction. Highly repetitive work. And yet, it is a pain in the ass to automate. Conversely, assembly line work is often easy to automate - except for random tasks which are actually a pain to deal with.

This is why manufactured goods have gotten way cheaper while houses have actually gotten more expensive.

229,ponieslovekittens,"&gt; What do you think about his US prediction?

The overall feel I get from his predictions is that he has an idea about the first vs third world that he's very attached to, and it's biasing his views. This is somebody who used to work for the state department (foreign relations) but who according to google never did anything especially noteworthy and apparently hasn't done much in the 20 years since. I kind of wonder if he's just bitter that his job in Washington never amounted to anything.

The US predictions...seem implausible to me.

But read them in context. Go [here](http://www.deagel.com/country/forecast.aspx?pag=1&amp;sort=Population&amp;ord=DESC) and scroll to the bottom of the page. and read the section in purple where he explains his reasoning.

A few things of note:

 * His primary source of data appears to be a Chinese report claiming that the US is lying about GDP, and that's it's actually a lot less than what the US government claims. I can believe that a government might lie about that kind of thing, but it seems awfully suspicious that a it's a Chinese agency that's claiming that the US' GDP is...lower than China's. If we accept that organizations might lie about this kind of thing, why are we believing China? I'm not convinced that China is a reliable source for the claim that China's economy is bigger than that of the US. And if that claim isn't true, then this guy's argument falls apart.

 * He says that people in the US will be migrating to Latin America and Asia...but his population numbers for those regions don't reflect that. If the population of A is 10,000,000 and the population of B is 1,000,000 and I tell you that people from A will move to B resulting in A and B having a population of 1,000,000 and 2,000,000...do you see the problem with that? His numbers don't accurately reflect the thing he's saying will happen. 

 * His views on technology and demographics are kind of...typical of an old person who doesn't understand technology or the world we live in. We don't live in the era of factory jobs. If 50-60 year olds outnumber ""young men with strong backs"" I just don't see that being much of a problem. I certainly don't see the economy falling part because of it. Granted, there are legitimate concerns about technology eliminating jobs, but it seems more likely to be that these would be handled with social programs than with 80% of the population moving to Mexico and Thailand for those precious third-world jobs he apparently thinks will be waiting. He mentions that the service economy is probably going to disappear, and he might be right. We see articles in this sub all the time about self driving cars and Amazon Go's cashierless checkout and so forth. A huge portion of jobs might be vanishing over the next ten years. That could happen. But if it does, do you really think the people who lose those jobs are going to move to places like Mexico to get jobs there instead? That seems unlikely to me.

 * A sizable portion of the US is composed of gun-toting self-sufficiency types. I have a very difficult time believing that rural America is going to move to Mexico and get jobs for pesos, when they can hunt for food and drive drunkenly into the sunset screaming ""America, fuck yeah!"" Sure, the average New Yorker isn't going to do that, but he's claiming that 280 million people are going to leave. That seems unrealistic to me. The US has a lot of empty land, and its people tends towards strong sense of individualism and national pride. Even if his premise turns out to be correct, even if the economy does collapse, even so...I don't think 80% of the population would leave.

I question his facts, his conclusions don't quite match his premise, and I don't think his ""let's all move to Mexico"" thing is going to happen.

Well one, it's definitely not that frequent. Waymo alone has 5 million miles and zero deaths. We don't have a single number of miles for the entire industry, but since Google is the biggest tester, I would say the entire industry has less than 50 million miles. Probably closer to 20.

Right now, there is about [1 fatality per 100 million miles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year) in the U.S.

But to say you are 5 times as likely to die in a self driving car than a regular car is just untrue, and bad math.

249,ponieslovekittens,"&gt; First, you are just interjecting a bureaucracy as a middle man between the manufacturer and the consumer.

While simultaneously, the overhead of having employees is eliminated.

&gt;Instead of goods being super-cheap as a result of automation, you are going to tax the manufacturer, who in-turn is going to raise the costs of the goods.

1) Cheap goods don't benefit people with no money to buy them.

2) If your claim is that eliminating the cost of employees and giving people that money without having to pay for hiring, training, payroll, insurance, physical infrastructure to accommodate humans, losses due to human error/calling in sick/smoke breaks, etc. you have failed to justify that claim.

3) Ultimately, so what? Even if costs do increase a little bit, it's better than the alternative of having cheaper goods but a couple dozen million people unable to buy them.

&gt;Second, you are removing labor from the market.

...well, _yeah_?

&gt;Imagine what our country would look like if 30-40% of the working population just decided to stop working.

Those jobs are going away _regardless_. We're having this conversation in /r/futurology. Have you not noticed the constant stream of article about self driving cars and cashierless checkout systems and so forth? Have you not noticed all the billionaires and tech people and economists saying this is going to be a problem? Have you no seen the studies from Oxford University and Pricewaterhosue-Cooper and Mckinsey Resarch? Jobs are going to start disappearing. In the US, the decline probably [already started back in 2000](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000). How does it make sense to worry about people choosing to stop working when job shortages are the problem in the first place? 

Would you rather have 30%-40% of jobs automated and 30%-40% of people sitting around homeless and starving in a country with 200 million guns, or would you rather have those 30%-40% of people twiddling their thumbs tryign to figure out what to do with their lives, but in no danger of starving to death because they're receiving a monthly check?

&gt;Your argument is premised on the notion that there won't be jobs for those people, but that's literally never happened in the history of automation.

Really? How many slaves do you own? What about your kids, do you have any? What ""new job"" are ten year olds working that replaced the old jobs harvesting in the fields and breaking up coal in the coal mines [like they used to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaker_boy#Use_of_breaker_boys) have?

Automation has permanently eliminated work for a _huge_ portion of our population, we just happen to have been fortunate enough to have demographics that we're ok with not working. 100 years ago it was pretty normal for a 10 year old to be working 60 hours a week. Today, it's pretty normal for a guy in his early 20s to still not be working. That's a big change, and if that trend of the past ~150 years continues, try to imagine a world future where instead of 20 year olds still not working, it's 30 year olds still in school, living with parents, not yet part of the labor force and living their lives. We've already seen that shift from 10 year olds working to 20 year olds not yet working. Imagine another ten years on top of that.

&gt; Every hour that's diverted from older jobs can get redirected toward better jobs. We don't make our own shoes by hand -- and the result is that every would-be cobbler can instead pursue thousands of other careers.

[What other jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU)? You mean the ""magic new jobs that we can't even imagine?"" Do people seriously still think that anymore?

262,Fuck_Up_Cunts,"&gt; What doesn't make sense to me about what you are saying is passing laws requiring no driver. Was there ever a law that required a driver? I don't understand that. What is the purpose of passing a law to require no driver if there is no law to require a driver in the first place? Unless federally it is illegal to have a car that doesn't have a driver. In which case, it doesn't matter if you pass local or state legislation allowing it. It will still be federally illegal. As was the case with marijuana. Legal in very many states, but federally illegal, which had serious repercussions.

It doens't make sense to you because you don't know what you're talking about. I told you about the legislation - I'm not going to explain it all too. Look it up

&gt;Also, I do not have a poor understanding of economics and Technology, but instead one founded on research and facts. Fact: against the desires of the American people, Congress authorized a bailout for GM. There is no such bailout for small businesses, of which 99% of American Business consists of. They completely negated the economic principle of the Invisible Hand. The market guides itself. The government should not be playing God and pulling companies out of financial turmoil. That only invites those very same companies to control Congress. If Congress is willing to throw trillions of dollars to these companies regardless if they pay Congress back or not, then Congress will be willing to allow these same companies to control legislation and control production unfairly. GM should no longer be in existence. It would have gone bankrupt and dissolved or at the very least diminished severely.

Governments follow Keynesian economics, not Smith's free-market capitalism. Governments 'guide' the economy all the time with monetary and fiscal policy to lessen the effects of a recession. Yes, the market would fix itself. It might also take a decade rather than a year and you could lose a whole generation of productivity (see: The Great Depression) From that we learned how to guide the economy out of recession. 

Not sure what point you're attempting to make regardless though. self-driving cars are going to get pushed through legislation for the reasons you specified. This is going to make a lot of people very, very rich. The only people hurt are low-skilled drivers. ",1521487057,dvyek63,t1_dvxv2eh,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2018

This is nonsensical.  We are literally in the midst of an automation revolution, dating back to the Industrial Revolution.  This has led to massive amounts of value, a huge upswing in jobs, and a drastic increase in the standard of living.  I think before you can start to scream ""the sky is falling"" you have to point to something concrete that supports the radical argument that people ""won't have money"" thanks to automation.

&gt;Have you not noticed the constant stream of article about self driving cars and cashierless checkout systems and so forth?

Yes, and each of those technical advancements are the result of people working in better, higher-skill jobs.  That's a good thing.  We should be racing for the top, instead of racing for the bottom.

They will have their own problems, different from human drivers, and potentially worse. For instance they might be better with reaction time, but are they better at adapting to new situations? I don't trust human programmers to account for everything that can possibly happen while driving. You're also switching out human error while driving with human errors programming, you're not completely eliminating human error.

1.25 million deaths per year, yet I've been driving for 20 years and never seen an accident occur in front of me. Never been involved in one. Compared to how much driving is done, 1.25 million deaths is low and accidents are relatively rare. SDCs won't be error-free, there will be deaths, and you have no data for how many, so you can't argue that as a reason to change. You shouldn't be fixing something that ""isn't broken"" unless you have solid data that it'll be better. Technical specs on paper (like reaction time) not proven in the real world don't count. We can create a few test markets in cities, switching everyone out to self-driving cars and collect the right data, but YOU can be in one of those cities.

Those numbers get drastically different if you remove illegal driving numbers that wouldn't be reflected in self driving cars. For example, removing drunk drivers from current car deaths reduces the numbers, however you can't remove those numbers from autonomous cars because they aren't in control of the vehicle.

We as humans see a kid playing ball and see him suddenly start running, we react when we see him start running. The self driving car would react when the kid is close to or in the street.

Driving cars is dangerous, but that's the point of developing self-driving cars in the first place.

394,foggy_interrobang,"The title of this article is clickbait – what matters is the data. Projections are nice, but this isn't valid statistical comparison by any stretch of the imagination.

As of December of last year, the company with the most miles driven on _actual roads_ (i.e. not in simulation) was Waymo, with four million miles. Uber had only done two million in that time, and earlier that year (in March) it was [reported](https://www.recode.net/2017/3/16/14938116/uber-travis-kalanick-self-driving-internal-metrics-slow-progress) that their software required human intervention almost every mile. IIHS [reports](http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/general-statistics/fatalityfacts/state-by-state-overview) that, in 2016, only 1.16 vehicular fatalities occurred per **hundred million miles** driven by humans.

I'm a software and electrical engineer working on designing and building safety-critical systems (those which have the potential to cause death or injury). These systems undergo intense and rigorous validation to ensure that their behavior is well-understood in all operating conditions. The nature of driving a vehicle on roads shared with other drivers makes this nearly impossible. As a result, it's important to understand that most self-driving vehicles these days use an approach called ""deep learning,"" in which driving rules are not _hardcoded_, but are instead learned using multi-layer neural networks. When you're driving your Tesla, autopilot is always engaged in the background, watching how you drive, and noting the differences between the actions _you_ take versus the actions it _would_ take. You essentially train a computer to drive, just by driving. This is called _supervised learning_.

Now, this may sound very cool. And if you're a nerd like me, it is. The challenge with deep-learned models is that they are hard to debug, or to even understand. The patterns that deep learning models encode may be difficult or even impossible for humans to understand – imagine looking at a human brain in a jar: the brain is there in front of you, which means that the information is there as well. But that doesn't mean you can look at it and understand it. Practically: this means that fixing a bug with how your car was ""taught"" to drive may be difficult-to-impossible.

To RESPONSIBLY build a safety-critical system for an autonomous vehicle, you need low-level, rigorously-verifiable rules that can supersede deep-learned reactions. Unfortunately, this takes a lot of time to do properly, and from insider scuttlebutt, I've heard that some manufacturers are taking some significant shortcuts. Likely including Uber, whose Silicon Valley attitude of ""move fast and break things"" has finally taken a life.

I build 55 pound things that fly, and that could kill you if they misbehave. At any given moment, there might be two of these in the air in the US. Uber's Volvo weighs 4,394 pounds, and they want to put _thousands_ on the road. Everyone should demand that they take their jobs at least as seriously as I take mine. They are demonstrably lacking the required rigor to develop safe systems.

Human beings get into car accidents all the time. At very high rates. But you can identify a human and revoke them of their driving privileges, and that one car is the only care
 they can potentially drive at that point in time.

If a car driving AI gets into an accident, that AI may be controlling thousands or millions of cars. You can't just take the one driver off the road. If you treat the computer like you treat a human, you now have to take thousands or millions of cars off the road. That one driver controls a shit ton of cars capable of causing a shit ton of havoc.

Yes, AI drivers may be safer. But when they fail, the acts  of failure may be much broader than a single human failing.

Edit: also, let's consider the idea of edge conditions and bugs like what happened today. It's unlikely, but they'll always happen. Now let's consider the idea of hacking.

It is not unusual for joggers, homeless people, students, or drunk people from Mill to be all over the streets at night, especially since the park (which runs parallel to Curry/Washington) is open until midnight.  The light rail also has a station stop a couple hundred yards from that intersection, where people often bike to/from.  

Generally speaking, Tempe is full of pedestrians at night because of the university, Mill, the abundance of sidewalks and bike paths and parks, and because of the culture there.  People like to go out in the evenings in the Phoenix area, especially during the summer.

With that said, it is quite common for people on bikes (or walking) to be hit by cars in Tempe.  I've been hit a few times over the years biking around Tempe, almost got hit jogging a couple summers back near A-Mountain.  I've known people who have been hit.  The Tempe Police Dept. is pretty good with traffic enforcement, they write a lot of tickets, but there are still tons of accidents.

It is unfortunate that this accident happened with the self-driving car, but before anyone speculates I would allow for an investigation to be completed before assuming the car's technology was to blame.  I'm an extremely vigilant driver, and many times I've had idiots on bikes or on foot just walk in front of my car, and they were lucky I was pay attention.

Self driving cars should be held to much higher standards than aircraft because they will transport much more people eventually and they will be facing much more unpredictable ssituations. 

Aircraft should be the first thing we fully automate, it is mostly about the controlling the plane and not much about reacting to the environment. Yes there is weather, other traffic, etc. but not comparable to the complexity of road traffic in any way. I believe we have the technology for that already.

Self driving is not about controlling the car, it is about understanding and reacting to the environment. We do not have the technology to understand the environment so I am surprised we are so quick with the development of self driving cars.

First, there are not hundreds of millions of drivers *on the road* in the US *at any given time*. The population is a little over 300 million and a significant portion of the population is underage, disabled, in prison, or commutes via public transport.

Second, this is 16 people in one day for humans. The self driving car is the first car to kill someone over the entire lifetime of self driving technology. So comparing the two rates isn't honest.

Third, there was a human driver that should have been supervising this technology as it hasn't been perfected yet. This error could easily be contributable to human error as well.

Edit: I've addressed this in other responses, but the point of my post was to refute the fearmongering used in the post by the person above. He/she tried to inflate the number of human drivers with respect to accidents to make it look like humans were comparatively safer drivers then they are. 

We should not be using number of registered cars or number of registered drivers to compare humans to self driving cars. We should be using accidents per time driving or accidents per distance driven. Those rates are the only ones that give a clear picture of which is safer.

 If a person drives 100 miles a day and gets in an accident, and a self driving car drives 1000 miles and gets in one accident, the rate of incident is not the same.  While this figure can be expressed as one accident per day for each, a more meaningful number would be .01 accidents per mile for humans and .001 accidents per mile for the self driving car. This measure makes clear that self driving cars are safer in this example.

If we make the cheap, simple math, that's 1 accident in 180 days or an average of 0.006 accidents per day as opposed to 16 on regular cars.

Still 3.75% of the total accidents by the population of self driving cars seems a bit much but that's not the only thing to be measured.

From here https://www.quora.com/How-many-drivers-are-on-the-road-at-any-given-time-in-the-US it seems there are roughly 14m drivers on the roads in the US at any time, and only averaging 16 deaths a day.

That doesn't even come close to being relevant because the *entire debate* here is whether Uber's self-driving fatality probability is worse or better than a human driver.

Let's try this another away. If, on average, there is a 1 in 100 million chance of killing someone in a mile driven, what's the probability of killing 1 person in 3 million miles? This is testing against a ""binomial distribution"". I thought you might want to know what it's called since you seem to like throwing out terms like ""small sample size"" without actually thinking about how they apply.

The answer is that, the chance of killing someone in 3 million miles is about .04%.

When I said they are likely more than an order of magnitude worse, I was referring to the same test but with a 1/10M chance instead of 1/100M. The probability that Uber's self driving cars have a fatality per mile rate greater than 1/10M, given 1 fatality after 3M miles driven, is about 96%.

Obviously this test isn't *exactly* applicable. Miles driven aren't independent. And self driving Ubers don't have the same type of driving as the average US driver (notably, less highways probably). But the overall point is that if you actually know anything about statistics, it's unreasonable to think that self driving Ubers could be comparable or better than human drivers after this accident.",1521527048,dvzdu9u,t1_dvzd19a,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2018

A self driving car has to compete with the drivers who have never been in an accident, who always make sure to leave adequate room, who predict potential obstacles before they've even reached them, and have already slowed down just in case. 

That's just the tip of the iceberg, they require preset routes, which means roadworks, nonstandard obstacles, and weather are all going to mess it up. This technology isn't close to ready, it's being rushed out, and this is going to be just the first death.

March of 2013, the technology of CRISPR-Cas9 had not yet been released as a viable form of genetic editing, but by this point humans already knew it was possible to edit human genes in a much more effective way than zinc finger nuleases or TALEN.

Less than one year later more than 1000 scientific papers had been published describing manners that CRISPR could be used for any kind of biology you wished.

In March of 2013 Google's little known special division to explore the possibility of self-driving cars was as yet unknown to the public. The big automakers smiled indulgently at Google like a parent would smile at your living room fort, just before they rolled their eyes.

Today all automotive manufacturers in the *world* are making and preparing to sell electric, level 5 autonomy vehicles within the next year.

This was computer processing power in the year 2013.

5.63 x 10 to the 14th power.

This is computer processing today.

9.01 x 10 to the 15th power.

In the year 2013, Deepmind was a small start-up in London. It would not be acquired by Google for one more year yet.

In 2017 Deepminds narrow AI, ""AlphaGo"" beat all human comers in the game called ""Go"". In Jan of this year a form of AlphaGoZero called ""AlphaStar"" beat some of the better, but not yet the best human players at StarCraft II. 

AI itself in 2013 was only just starting to be associated with game-changing technology of using GPUs for AI dedicated architectures. As you can see already, the world is a *very* different place than the year 2013. We can clearly see now that AI/machine learning is going to change the entire concept of human employment.

In March of 2013, bipedal humanoid robots were still the stuff of science fiction.

&gt;In 2013, DARPA program manager Gill Pratt compared the prototype version of Atlas to a small child, saying that ""a 1-year-old child can barely walk, a 1-year-old child falls down a lot ... this is where we are right now""[1]. 

We know what Atlas can do now.

By March of 2013 I had been aware, courtesy of a Wired magazine article about a fantastic new technology that would enable a form of VR undreamed of prior to the year 2012.

In about 2 more years I prophesy that VR will begin to turn into an addiction issue within society. Yes, it will be that good.

In Mar of 2013. Nobody had ever *heard* of 4K OLED screens. Little less *8K*.

Quantum computers in March of 2013 were the D-wave 2. A subtype called an adiabatic quantum annealing computer was available for sale. Several were purchased. But it was not even certain in Mar of 2013 that quantum entanglement was even occurring. (It was)

Today we have honest to gosh logic-gate quantum computers and they are going to follow a Moore's Law kind of effect their ownselves as described by this post from just *today* (4 Mar 19)

https://www.cnet.com/news/ibms-quantum-computing-ambitions-get-exponential-like-moores-law/?utm_source=reddit.com

So this is just the changes that have occurred in the last 6 years. And there is another element in all of this. I call it ""synergy"". Nothing happens in a vacuum any longer. All advances in all fields of science and technology are now driven by the multiplier of post 2015 computing speed, big data and computer architectures that did not exist in 2013. Things are already going faster, and we are only one year into the next 6 years.

Then there is the phenomenon of exponential thinking that makes it super difficult to apprehend how fast things can change. I put together a few for some insight.

How many different computing/AI, biotech, materials science and electronics are under wraps today but will be revealed to us this year. What might ""Atlas"" do this year to make our jaws drop in staggered astonishment. That bar is pretty high already if you ask me.

But my craziness is not yet done. Yes, it will be nearly inconceivable magick in 6 years time. But five years after that? The technological singularity. Hopefully ""human friendly"". After that? All bets are off. Raymond Kurzweil had it pegged at 2045 in the year 2009, but we all know now that 2030 is probably a lot closer to the mark.

24,sanem48,"&gt; especially with the crappy version of ""AI"" that exists today

I would argue that this is the entire mistake with your logic: you look at the AI we have today (that you know about), and you assume that's what will be doing the coding. how can the AI on your phone that can't do the simplest of complex task today, take over some of the most complex jobs known to man, in less than 2 years?

but in doing so you're ignoring the obvious: you are using a freaking computer, the most technologically advanced piece of equipment created on earth ever, and it only took about 50 years to get what you're holding right now. and you think that's normal

if you take a step back and look at the big picture, you'll see two things: our technology is evolving at rocket speeds, and it does so as an exponential S-curve. that means that to us on the ground AI for example seems to have been flat for the last 20 years, ever since it defeated a pro human player at Chess, and it's now reaching the limits of that potential (doing little more than beating more advanced versions of Chess)

but sooner or later, the S-curve is going to start its move up, and when that happens, AI will go from playing silly games to putting entire industries out of a job overnight. that's already coming for self driving cars, but that is a very risky and complex industry that requires huge investments and overcoming huge legal, social and economic hurdles

with coding it's different, because there's little to stop anyone of creating the world's next Whatsapp/Facebook/Instagram/Airbnb/Google/Bitcoin with little more than some AI coding, where even a marginal improvement over human abilities can produce superhuman godlike results. or it will allow traditional companies to finally get rid of these expensive nerds, and those that don't won't last long. if anything those that rely on legacy systems and legacy human coders might go bankrupt because the AI can't fix their issues, and they end up with an obsolete system and hugely expensive human support basis that can't possibly compete with AI driven systems that do a much better job at a fraction of the cost

you say AI can't do the coding because it won't understand the old systems, but what if the AI makes those old systems obsolete? we're not talking Windows 7 vs Windows 10 here, but Windows 1.0 (human coding) vs Windows 1000 (AI coding). computer technology gave us Microsoft and Apple, the internet gave us Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Tencent and Facebook, which are 7 out of the 8 biggest companies in the world. imagine what companies an AI revolution will give us?

of course there will be problems and challenges, and I can't say for sure how long it'll take, maybe 50 years, maybe 5 years, maybe 5 months, I'm open to any possibility. but the big difference between me and you is that you exclude the possibility that AI will surprise us, when I know for a fact that it has done so again and again, and probably will do again. so if the average person like you considers 2 years to be impossible, then that sounds about right",1551760786,ehtja9i,t1_ehrrhjh,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2019

36,dnesteruk,"There are a few aspects to this.

First, as you may already realize, most governments are characterized by one thing: woeful inefficiency. Robots reduce this inefficiency. This would then suggest that the government has to get into the robots game also.

Only there's one problem. Government still buys its toys from private businesses. Like, when government (including defense institutions) want computers, they buy them from private businesses. I can see it going like this:

Govt: Hey can I buy this robot please?
Bsns: No.
Govt: What do you mean no?
Bsns: Well, we don't have any. Try asking the Russians.

Nationalization... that's an interesting one. You can nationalize a business, but then this business will not innovate. Soviet Union nationalized the means of production of food, which led to mismanagement and starvation and lots of misery. Nationalization does not work in the tech space because people would not innovate if they don't own the result of their work.

I see a different scenario: the scaling down of government. Automation means employing fewer people. Electronic services obviate government bureaucracy (look at Estonia, they are leading in this). The printing of money doesn't look so good once the economy starts scaling down instead of scaling up. Entire industries just dissappear. For example, the auto insurance industry goes away after self-driving cars reduce the number of accidents to almost zero. Policing becomes easier once we have cameras everywhere (see China) and drones flying and shooting at suspects and whatnot.

You'd have to have cars located in safe locations (avoiding crime) but also accessible within 5 minutes.  It seems like for this to work in the US it would be significantly limited to certain locations and not necessarily on a grand scale.

Now, this is not to say it isn't possible but it would come with some many other issues as u/insertcoinforcredit already mentioned like being clean. You'd have to have people checking the cars constantly to make sure they are sufficiently serviced.  If they relied on people rating the car's well being it could be an issue too.

The thing about job evolution is that not knowing what jobs are around the corner swings both ways. Look at Twitch streamers. There’s many forms of “labor” today which consist of getting donations for being funny or popping off a headshot. 

To me, this clearly shows how the economy is becoming more and more detached from the expectation of value being produced by human labor. The first stage of this transition was the service based economy that arose after industrialization. 

My point here is that we’re increasingly unable to make good decisions about where to develop our skills. 

Automating fieldwork with a plow gave a natural transition to building plows in factories. 

Automating call center workers with a single Machine Learning algorithm developed by 1 team of engineers at google doesn’t provide a clear path to the “next” job. 

It’s not like an automated call center worker needs to go work on the algorithm that replaced it. It literally gets better with every interaction. 

It’s not like an automated truck driver needs to go and build the new self driving trucks. These manufacturing processes already exist and are already largely automated themselves.

Memberships will start high. $600/month for unlimited rides anywhere, anytime. Gradually things will get cheaper. Public transportation will probably still cost less than self-driving ride-sharing. 

 

But the first big swing won't be with the poor, it will be with the middle class. People who current own multiple cars because they want the luxury and convenience they provide. They will see the same benefits or better from self-driving ride-sharing memberships at a lower cost. So they'll make the switch. 

 

The benefit's won't be held by those who struggle to get around. But with major consumer pools who hold multiple cars and will see savings of $500-$1000/month. And where will this money go? Right back into the economy.

My thinking has shifted from self driving cars to small, human operated, public busses that are still running in a rideshare program that delivers travelers door-to-door, departure to destination, with rides pooled by a central intelligence. 

The goal in tackling traffic has to be in directly upgrading the current system, which means travelers must be able to travel the roads uninhibited and this must be made even more convenient; which to me means giving up the act of driving for the luxury of riding. We're fighting against one of the greatest pieces of technology in history, which elevates regional mobility far above any other mode of transportation yet. The only way out is through.

Self driving taxi bots can be used to replace traffic with 10% of the vehicles, ideally. I think the transition would result differently. 

And what I really think now is that the best implementation would be to stop seeing taxis as cars, but as a method. If taxis can be shared intelligently, by combining requested rides through a central agency (as Uber and Lyft already do), then it can be done in the same way with higher-capacity vehicles, which would further reduce the number of vehicles needed, while making trips more comfortable for riders. I think that small busses are easier to board (especially for handicapped) and give more space between strangers on the trip, as well as providing more luggage space. With less vehicles, relying on human drivers is more viable as well—payroll. Self driving technology is ultimately questionable, I think. Especially in regions that go through seasons with white out snow. Plus this:

* Climate change (and how does a world look like with a +3° Celsius Climate) and all the nice things that come with it. A new refugee crisis, maybe a war, food shortage...
   * 50 years from now, we're either kinda boned or we're not. If you want to represent a ""bad ending"" scenario, you could represent a floating/submersible city, or perhaps an underground one.
* Hyperloop
* Are Airplanes obsolete if a Hyperloop exists? (The city we are supposed to plan is going to be on an airport, if not are E-planes becoming a thing? How does an airport look if planes are able to start vertically)
   * Electric airplanes will definitely happen in the next 50 years. We're basically a few battery advancements away already, and 50 years is enough time that those advancements should be solved for. Runways could essentially be helipads, so your airport may be a series of concentric circles wrapping around those helipads rather than needing to have an open side of tarmac dedicated to takeoff.
* Since we are imagining a future in 50 years, how did the world look 50 years ago and how imagined the people from back then our present?
   * People 50 years ago expected us to have flying cars and moon bases and jetpacks. There was some expectation of elevated or flying cities as well. Oh and robots, anywhere from sentient robot assistants to houses packed with over-the-top robot everything.
* Our energy system. How could a system look like which relies solely on renewable energy sources. Could it be possible right now? What about our increasing Energy Usage? What are “new” energy concepts like fusion power?
   * Definitely possible, but difficult due to storage issues. Fusion \*might\* be achieved in 50 years, but unless it gets a lot more funding I wouldn't expect a whole city to be powered by it already. If you wanted a really cool futuristic energy source, you could have carbon-eating bacteria that produces electricity as a bi product used as bio-luminescence to light the streets and as a power source.
* How are we going to move in 50 years? Are privately owned cars still going to be a thing? Or are they going to be extinct with the rise of a Hyperloop or sideways moving elevators. Or will there be a transport system, using your phone for example: you type in were you want to go and some algorithm assigns a bus or a car to you to pick you up.
   * The way the market is moving I wouldn't expect private ownership to be a huge thing, but likely more of a niche or rich person market. Self-driving vehicles of all kinds would likely be deployed at this point, so whatever you're in will be driving itself. Could be anything from flying transportation pods to underground transportation, over-ground rail, but I think streetcars would not be a thing - I mean think how great a city would be if the only traffic you had to deal with was foot traffic. If it's a brand new city being made 50 years from now, I would expect them to avoid ground transportation.
* Could we build a city in which every Building is connected via an underground “ant-like” elevator system.
   * Sure. We could do that now, in fact a lot of northern cities have something like this minus the elevator.
* Could we build a City underground? How deep can we dig? How big could a man-made cave underground be?
   * Sure. Volume becomes an issue at scale currently, as our digging solutions are rather slow. So making long tunnels is very doable but making big open cavernous environments is less so. Maybe they could use a fleet of robots that can cling to walls and convert minerals/dirt into electricity to bore out a cave to whatever specifications are desired.
* How will our food production look like? Could it be possible to feed whole cities with food grown in vertical farms in or below the city?
   * In 50 years I hope we've found some way to generate food matter from either electricity or by stripping and re-configuring atoms, so maybe we'll have Star Trek-like matter replicators? If not, yes I would expect some sort of vertical farming would be absolutely necessary in a self-sufficient city.
* How are we going to live in 50 years? Apparently 75% of the world population are going to live in big cities. How will those cities change? Or is our live going to change even more with the possibility of traveling at the speed of sound. Will I be able to live in, let’s say Berlin and work in Barcelona because i can be there in about an hour or so.
   * Telepresence. doesn't matter where you live because you'll show up to work virtually through AR or VR. The average person will probably leave their house a lot less with automatic deliveries and virtual entertainment, fitness and socialization.
* I’d like to make a presentation about how long 50 years really are in technological advances, for example 70% or so of the Jobs people are working in right now didn’t even exist 50 years ago.
   * Good subject. The last 50 years was a huge series of technological advancements, and the next 50 years is probably going to be a much larger leap in technology due to exponential growth.
* Since the airport where we will plan our cities is owned by a private organisation i want to look into mega corporations and their influence in the world which will probably grow even more.
   * Assuming this is an American city I would expect corporations to have basically perfect control of government as it pertains to its business dealings, and due to the power of social regard they would probably exert a lot of pressure on governments to make faster progressive moves towards social equality. Mixed bag really, though all of that probably depends on how well we fight monopolies in 50 years.

91,coke_and_coffee,"&gt;Most technology you use today was once science fiction...

Missing the point...

&gt; we are already seeing AI replacing a lot of aspects of our work.

Yeah, in **network engineering.** 9/10 jobs aren't even close to a risk of automation replacement.

&gt;I'd like to hear what jobs you're talking about. Not interested in government jobs, as those don't count.

Most office workers regularly complain about how their job is useless. And why wouldn't government jobs count?

Anyway, just step outside your field for a second and explain to me how a machine is going to take over for nurses, doctors, design engineers, construction workers, mechanics, programmers, graphic designers, marketing, business. It won't. These jobs are not at risk. Automation will take over manual and repetitive labor and release people from that drudgery, just like it has for the last several hundred years. And they will move into other fields. Programming didn't even exist as a job just half a century ago, not there are millions of programmers.

Look, I'm a scientist, I believe in technology. I believe humans are just machines, the world is deterministic. We can eventually build machines just as capable of intelligent thought as human beings. But that is a *looooong* way off. Literally centuries. What you call ""AI"" is just programmable logic at this point. Very niche and narrowly applied. Self-driving cars have been in the pipelines for at least 20 years now, and still nobody has released one. The nearest plans for self-driving vehicles will be in specific small easily navigable cities where all possible routes have essentially been pre-programmed in the vehicles.

Safer - This is proven tech. [Cabin lifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrocable_(Medell%C3%ADn)) have been around for decades and enclosed lifts like the ones in the video have already a far better safety record than any UNPROVEN autonomous car ever will. The example above is a modern advanced version of old tech. 

Convenient - autonomous cars are likely to increase traffic as reported [here](https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/611557/self-driving-cars-could-make-urban-traffic-jams-worse/). I don't know what's convenient about that. Also cars are 2 dimensional (unless you dig comparatively expensive tunnels) so that means you will always be stopping or slowing at intersections or getting hit by moose or deer etc running in the way.

"" not limited by needing infrastructure."" What do you call roads &amp; highways. They are highly resource intensive wasteful forms of infrastructure.  Of course we will always need some roads but not anywhere near as big or overly engineered as the roads we have today designed to carry the wear and weight of millions of cars.

Cheaper - Wind resistance, rolling resistance, weight, complexity, land use, quantity and rarity of materials, workforce needed, insurance risks, maintenance are all vastly reduced with a system like this. As Elon Musk is famously quoted as saying ""Go back to first principles"". Autonomous cars are portrayed as the best answer but again they require vast labour, computing, engineering, infrastructure and land resources and even after all those bills are paid will still have the potential to crash, will weigh 10 times more then the weight of their average payload, will have worse wind resistance and will require vast computing capability which is highly resource intense.",1552653105,eil01ns,t1_eikni4k,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2019

Take truck driving, if the vast majority of those companies replace with self-driving trucks say 3/3.5 million those jobs are gone. There will be an increased demand for repair and maintenance on these machines but mechanics already exist and say, Tesla doesn't need 3 million guys in their repair department to help troubleshoot. So let's say they hire 10,000 new educated people to assist companies with a service providing remote diagnostic assistance for the trucks, that is still a net loss of over 2.9 million jobs and those drivers now have a skill that has no value whatsoever apart from the remaining 500k or so jobs that are going to see a big decrease in wages as there are 3 million people desperate to fill those positions.

We have already seen this massive reduction in industry jobs first in agriculture then in industrialization. Car factories today have a fraction of the total number of employees that they once did thanks to robotic assembly, those job numbers from that industry never came back. We are running out of low skill industries for people without higher education which has caused the price and demand of college to explode to unreachable levels for a lot of people as it is and why we have people with a BS working as baristas because there are only so many bachelor's jobs available to our population.

In the long term the fear is that people will be made obsolete when automation provides self-diagnostic and repair.

If we put the social element, the resistance to change plus the social impact we would need to add 5 years more probably?, the impact to jobs related to driving a vehicle is enormous so we should expect a great resistance from there.

149,Surfitall,"Without any context at all...no, although evidence shows that quality of life goes up significantly for recipients.  However, with a little context about why this is needed now vs. any time in history...it’s an idea that makes sense.

Context:  We are still in the early innings of the greatest technological shift the world has ever seen.  If the smartest people in the world are right, a third of all working Americans will lose their jobs to automation in the next 12 years, then it starts making more sense to help us through this transition.  In the next 12 years!

Since 2000, technology has displaced over 4M manufacturing workers and decimated communities in the Midwest. In my opinion the politicians inability to recognize the beginnings of this shift is why Trump was elected primarily in those states where this has already begun.

If Americans have no source of income—no ability to pay for groceries, buy homes, save for education, or start families with confidence—then the future could be very dark. Our labor participation rate now is only 62.7% – lower than it has been in decades, with 1 out of 5 working-age men currently out of the workforce (this despite our continued very high official unemployment rates). This will get much worse as self-driving cars and other technologies come online.

Automation is something that can transform the world for the better, its something to be excited about. No more boring repetitive jobs. But during the transition there will be a lot of suffering if we don’t step up to help each other.  Truck driving alone is the most common job in 29 states with 3.5 million drivers, with an additional 12 million people supporting them in truck stops and other related industries across the country.  Automated trucks are already making deliveries in Colorado.

1 out of 10 American workers currently work in retail.  How many more malls are closing around the country because people are buying things through their computer? Clerical workers, imaging technicians, paralegals, you can keep going down this list of job titles that are going away sooner than people realize.

Without Universal Basic Income, we will see opportunities shrink as more and more work gets performed by software, AI, and robots. Markets don’t work well when people don’t have any money to spend. Universal Basic Income is a vital step to helping society transform through the greatest automation wave in human history.

One of the biggest problems in fact is improperly zoned ""truck routes"". There are hundreds if not thousands of towns across the country, big and small that have designated truck routes (you can be ticketed for straying from them if you are a ""thru truck"") that have inadequate space for turning at specific intersections. There's times where trucks must drive on the shoulder, oncoming lane and make cars in the left turn lane back up or move out of their lane in order to make a turn.

Granted autonomous trucks will first be restricted to highways. But that means interstate-only in most cases.

158,TheOnlyPoem,"&gt;  that UBI has to come from somewhere.

Exactly; and I will come through in the forms of catching some of the money many large multi-billion dollar companies (Some in the trillions)  that pay 0$ taxes currently.

The first argument people make on this is something along the lines of : ""Then the price of their goods go up.""

Lets take Amazon for example.

First lets look at the sorts of jobs likely to be replaced in 10-20 years- 
-Truckers replaced by self-driving trucks (3.5million at 50,000$ = 175B $ in savings

-Retail works replaced (4.3million people at 25,000$ = 107.5B$ in savings)

That is not considering others involved in these strings of businesses - like accountants.

Just these two things looks like our local market traders are looking to save nearly 300B$ in expenses to sell you goods locally (Like a Walmart for example.)

Meanwhile Amazon, and other tech giants, will be getting hit with the VAT - a tax proposal that would raise about 800$billion for the U.S to assist in paying for the UBI.

Here is where logic is flawed by many; they see increase in taxes means it will come directly from their pockets but:

Local retails prices go down due to savings = Amazon is not going to raise prices due to VAT.

Why?  Because they need to stay competitive to the local market.  If you need to spend an extra 20-30$ to buy everything from Amazon that shows up tomorrow- or save that money and go to your local retailer.  Most people would shift back to shopping locally for goods again.

That's not going to happen.  What will happen; is that Amazon is going to take the VAT hit and pay taxes without raising your prices on goods.

And UBI money doesn't disappear.  Its paid out to the American people; only for much of it circulate back into the government to help pay for UBI as well.  The 12,000/year would mean roughly 400B$ in taxes collected from things like sales tax.

Those two points; along with the initial cannibalism of our current social welfare programs (a staggering 1.5T$ current price tag on it itself) is where the money comes from.  So no; you will not be paying for it yourself - or 'across the board.'

Existing truck fleets have costs remember? The op was focusing only on driver costs and was being quite generous with how low they placed those wages, there are a lot of incidentals in employing staff. 
  
As for the self drive truck fleet, we will see considerable savings there too. Most being developed are electric, esp for short and medium range where the vast amount of trucking occurs. Diesel costs are a major component and reducing this by using electric is a decent saving. 
  
Other costs are wear and tear whi also will be significantly reduced by having systems that can measure forces precisely and apply breaking or acceleration to cause minimal wear. Ultimately, timed intersections will reduce the majority of breaking as vehicles communicate with each other and time their passage through an intersection so neither has to stop.
  
Self driving tricks do not have to stop for the driver to get some sleep  so will be used more. Their lower wear and tear will mean less time off the road being repaired. 
  
There will be initial savings on switching but as the tech develops, there will be much more. A 95% reduction in accidents will probably not be available in the first generation but it will ultimately be achieved and the savings from that will also help with transportation costs.

182,DisruptiveCourage,"But self-driving could not have been done a long time ago, as you said in your previous few posts. The tech didn't really exist.

Sharing systems like Uber Carpool are not substitutes for cars for the same reason that buses aren't substitutes - you don't own them. This means that for long drives with luggage (pretty common to bring stuff with you if you're going far...), a ridesharing service would not be feasible. It also means you have to share the vehicle with randoms, which people generally choose not to do if they can avoid it. Shuttles have the same problem.

I highly doubt we will get to 100% self-driving in most places within my lifetime. It's not that the tech won't be ready, but the legislation. There are millions of non-self-driving cars that will still want to use the road network; they won't disappear overnight, and any government policy putting a sunshine date on their legality would be *massively* unpopular. If it's illegal, or *soon to be* illegal, to drive non-self-driving cars on the road, the resale value of them will go through the floor - cars are the second most expensive things people own (other than their house), who's gonna support having all that value thrown away?

Your arguments about traffic improvements aren't all that much of a selling point on long trips, either. Traffic generally is pretty rare on freeway driving. There aren't really traffic jams on roads in the middle of nowhere... it's mostly a city/dense area problem. Your 45mph max speed limit would definitely slow things down more than the occasional traffic jam as you enter the city.

Generally, massive improvements can be made with just proper road design and planning, something that many places lack in. ",1553708000,ejibadq,t1_eji9nnx,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2019

184,DisruptiveCourage,"I'm not from the US; my view is regarding western society as a whole.

Most of the western world is woefully unprepared for such a shift. Even Europe will have big implementation issues imo; even simple infrastructure (like charging systems for EV's) is lacking across the continent to a worse degree than lots of the US (thanks to the Supercharger network). Peak self-driving efficiency (and safety) cannot be reached until all other cars are eliminated, and such efficiency will require radical reimagining of our signaling systems, removal of the concept of ""lanes"", peer-to-peer communication infrastructure so that cars can communicate intents with each other, etc. None of this comes quickly - or cheap.

There is also the cultural shift that is required for the public to support such regulation. Public transit doesn't exactly have the best of reputations in many places (poor safety, inconsistency/unreliability, slow, etc), and self-driving rideshares are pretty much just a fancy word for public transit. How many people are going to want to give up their car because ""we promise this public car will be better""?

To be quite honest, I think you're gonna have to wait for the people that are alive right now to just die in order to force that through. Even the older millenials will probably oppose your plan (the ones that are old enough to own nicer cars/see it as more than a means to an end). Driving is an important part of our cultural psyche in western countries; a person's car is probably the second-most expensive thing they will ever own (after their home), not only is it valuable financially but it is also valuable psychologically because of the freedom that it represents (can go anywhere, anytime - no schedules, no sharing, etc), so taking away this will probably be much more opposed than you think, even if the new system that you replace it with is more efficient. In order to go 100% self driving, you'll need the population to be filled with people that have never owned a car in the first place - thus they don't feel like they're losing anything by giving up the freedom to do so.

In Asia, sure, I can see the implementation of self-driving cars being popular. Asian cities are not only very dense, but driving is not culturally viewed in the same way as it is in the west. Not much use for a car in Hong Kong or Shenzhen.

63% of americans dont even have $1,000 in the bank.  So, I just don't see many of them being able to pass up the opportunity to save.  most people have a car problem and they have to get help from a family member.  What happens now when the family member can buy them a card self-driving taxis.

the thing is there will be plenty of early adopters to get this going.  

if technology continues to fall at a similar rate.  we could have single taxi rides that could be only 10 cents a mile.  that is about the same cost as these e-scooters are now.

191,hack-man,"I was looking for anything interesting from futurist Hans Moravec, and stumbled upon this 1995 article in WIRED. Hans is now 70 years old, and while he was a bit optimistic in a few of his predictions for the future of robotics, he was pretty damn close on others.

I'll include a few excerpts of the (very long) article for people who don't like to click:

&gt; Today, Moravec is a professor at Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute, the largest robot research lab in the country and one he helped establish in 1980.

&gt; His office is next door to the ""high bay,"" a big lab displaying the results of previous Robotics Institute projects, including a huge, multilegged ""walker"" that was sent down into the cone of an active volcano, and a Pontiac minivan that can drive itself at speeds up to 60 mph. The van has already found its way from Pittsburgh to Washington, DC, with minimal human supervision, under the legal fiction that its four onboard Sparcstations and their mechanical interface are ""an advanced form of cruise control.""

I didn't realize that ""self-driving cars"" had advanced that much by 1995

&gt; ""I spent most of the 1970s,"" he recalls, ""trying to teach a robot to find its way across a room. After 10 years, in 1979, I finally had one that could get where it was going three times out of four - but it took five hours to travel 90 feet.""

That sounds about right from what I remember of the 1970s :-) 

&gt; By 2000, he foresees that this type of machine will find its own way around complex, cluttered places without using markers and without needing to be installed by experts. At first these robots will be expensive and specialized, but Moravec predicts they will become smaller, cheaper, and more user-friendly in just the same way that microcomputers evolved from mainframes. 

I don't think that quite happened by 2000, but the Boston Dynamics robots were starting to do that type of thing with ""Big Dog"" in 2005

&gt; Add more memory and computing power and enhance the software, and by 2020 we have a second generation that can learn from its own performance. ""It will tackle tasks in various ways,"" says Moravec, ""keep statistics on how well each alternative has succeeded, and choose the approach that worked best.

2020 is still a year away, but I'm not sure I'd say that robots are really learning from their past mistakes (but maybe my definition of that is different than those actually in the robotics field)

&gt; By 2030, according to Moravec, we should have a third-generation universal robot that emulates higher-level thought processes such as planning and foresight. ""It will maintain an internal model not only of its own past actions, but of the outside world,"" he explains.

I don't think 2030 is out of the realm of possibility for this. And this prediction is from an article from 24 years ago

&gt; By around 2040, there will be no job that people can do better than robots.

I can't wait for this; it can't get here soon enough

&gt; Today, he points out, people who retire are supported via wealth that is ultimately created by industry. As industry becomes more efficient, there will be more wealth, allowing people to retire earlier. When industry is totally automated and hyper-efficient, it will create so much wealth that retirement can begin at birth

And here he is describing Universal Basic Income about 15 years before I ever heard of it. Yes, I know UBI ""almost passed"" (bipartisan, even) when Nixon was president, but I was too young to care about such things back then

* Reading books online was pretty much a given, and again they missed by having some super awkward idea of physically seeing the pages. Video calling a physical book :P 
* Paying a toll without slowing down was something a lot of people wanted (and in a lot of places people still want it). The technology they propose is nothing like the technology we use for toll collection without stopping

199,NillaThunda,"""In the past, the long-term effects of technological advancement on employment have been positive. Technology has allowed workers to do their jobs better and faster, which in turn, increased output and raised living standards. ""

Yes, in the past tech advances have been good.  This tech advance though is directly taking the job out of the hands of humans.  This is not like anything humanity has seen before.  Robots like this are an exponential degree more efficient than humans.  They are not an automatic drill or an IC Engine, compared to hand tools and horses.

People will be free to do what they love, yes.  Unfortunately for a lot of people, doing what you love does not put food on the table, unless you love farming.  

Will new jobs be created, absolutely.  Will 55 year old truckers or middle career factory workers, who get ousted by self driving trucks and robots like this, be a part of these new jobs, we can agree to disagree.  

""They can learn to code."" Good luck with that.

This paper is looking for full employment, revised IP laws, reduced work hours, and free higher ed education to create a society which will better adapt to technological advances.  With the fact none of these are actual things in America and that robot is, what say you internet stranger?

""When machine replaces humans, the result, faster growth, and in time rising employment.""  I 100% agree with this since based on the past it is a factual statement.  The issue I have with it, is **in time**.  In time employment rises, is great for the future, but the number of jobs certain advances in the past took over was not anywhere near close to the number of human jobs which are about to become machine jobs.  

Multiple entire industries are going to be lost at or around the same time. 

13 million people make their living in the transportation industry in the US.  Self driving tech and robots like this take those jobs.  Granted all those jobs will not disappear overnight, but you are talking about almost 10% of the people employed in the US.  This does not even touch all the other jobs lost to automation.

You can believe whatever part of this you want to I will take this from your reading.

The traditional story of androids overthrowing human labor does highlight that not everyone will be affected equally by the supposed impending mass technological unemployment. Futurists and economists have claimed that the rise of the robots will likely displace “low-skilled” workers in far greater numbers than “high-skilled” workers, thus further exacerbating our already deeply unequal labor market and society.1
 Further, these technologies can be used to discipline labor, as workers who demand higher wages or better benefits can simply be replaced by R2D2000. If large disruptions in the labor market occurred, they may lead to large-scale unemployment, suppressed wages, and declining labor force participation rates. At the same time, the winners from the robot revolution, those who own the intellectual property (IP) and the workers who are essential to run such technologies, will likely see massive windfalls. In the end, “technological progress is going to leave behind some people, perhaps even a lot of people, as it races ahead” (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014).2",1553828983,ejmqz64,t1_ejly7l9,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2019

So why the rush?

Because safe self-driving cars are the future for economic and ecological (shared EV, public transport) reasons but they are not created over night. Obviously.

This story is about Norway, and I can give you some first-hand experience that highlights a few issues that are unique to Norway:

1: Norway has over 90% of its electricity made with hydro-power dams. So the issue of energy expenditure is limited compared to other places.

2: People in Norway live spread over large areas. Having everyone commute by bus, would still mean having just one or two people in each bus.

3: The climate in Norway is nasty. If you want to experience climate change - move to Norway! The difference is noticeable over just a few years. It's not a lot warmer, but it is a lot wetter! This does not make for a very comfortable cycling trip.

For Norway, a good mid- to long-term solution for personal transport would be self-driving cars that are communally owned for daily commutes.

2.  They are being deceptive about just the computer going into production but the software and sensors and everything else to ensure it works isn’t ready.

3.  They are lying about going into production and they are actually just making another prototype

Should they simply try to protect their passengers? What if that leads them to swerve onto the footpath and into soft, squishy pedestrians instead of the massive SUV on the other side of the road.

So we should already have laws in place that dictate what to do in such situations. After all they can happen. And sometimes do happen. It doesn't even have to be a car. E.g. there was a case when someone crash landed a plane on a beach full of people and killed someone. He could landed in water (worse chances for him). But he didn't. Is it good? Bad? Idk.

&gt;In regards to the 33% sales drop in Q1 2019, it just shows how little you understand the nature of the auto industry. Q1 is historically always the worst quarter in auto industries. In regards to Tesla, that 33% Q1 drop is in comparison to Q4 2018, a quarter in which Tesla sold 33% MORE CARS IN THAT QUARTER ALONE THAN IN THE ENTIRE PREVIOUS YEAR OF 2017. 

It's not complicated. Tesla had a backlog of pre-orders and they ran through them. It is now very obvious that their less demand. That is why they dropped prices. Do other auto companies routinely see decreases in sales by 33% in Q1? No, they do not.

&gt;Tesla spent the majority of Q1 efforts setting up shipping and delivery for vehicles in China and the E.U., which made them under deliver by roughly 12,000 units, or 17.6% of purchased vehicles. But I'm sure you know Tesla doesn't declare a car sold until after delivery, which is why ""sales"" were down 33%.

How conservative of Tesla to use the definition of sale that everyone else uses. Very unusual for a company that routinely deceives and lies (see: swappable battery)

I've had an argument with a trucker regarding an article about self-driving trucks potentially taking over most of freight in 20 years.  I said it would be great to ""free up a human"" to do something less menial than just driving.  I think he didn't like my implication that his livelihood was meaningless, so I followed it up with ""but it likely won't be for another generation"", so he would still be driving for the rest of his career, yet he still insisted that his family-owned trucking company would be taken over by his son(s).  At my mere suggestion that maybe his sons might consider doing something else less replaceable, he took offense.  Excuse me for giving some actual advice?

I found this, quite frankly, just stupid - in 11-15 years from now, when he is in the workforce, there would probably be even more environmental concerns than even today, so how likely would he even be working in the oil industry?  Of course, he's just a kid, he doesn't know any better, of course he wants to be like his dad.

If there are indeed more jobs in solar, etc., hopefully that kid (and in general, others in the same generation) would at least consider them.

there are almost a dozen different types of energy storage.  some regions have great hyrdro, wind, and solar.  some regions have great solar and okay wind.  so the storage needs for each region are different.

france had the best nuclear program in the world.  even they are gradually replacing nuclear with renewables.  

if 20 years ago all the governments, companies, universities, institutions had really done the research to bring the cost down of nuclear down and developed a great cookie cutter method for churning nuclear plants out nuclear would be far different.  unfortunately that never happened.

now the only nuclear plants that get built are insured by governments.  They have delays that last several years.  their cost over runs are massive.  

its a race to see if nuclear will play much of a role or not.  

our capacity factors for wind keep increasing too.  in europe offshore wind is anticipate to get to 70%.  solar and batteries are dropping so fast we dont even know what the mix will be between solar and wind.

then we have self-driving EV taxis.  we have no clue at what speed those will grow, and how smartly they will be charged.  most people think they will be charged once at night when wind is churning.  then topped off here and there througout the day while solar is producing.  

i study it as a hobby several hours a day for five years now.  I am not anti nuclear.  its just every year solar, wind, and batteries get cheaper faster than anyone predicted

then everyone thought solar themal plus storage was going to die out.  but then chile, morocco, and middle east all came up with 24-7 power for solar thermal plus storage for 6 to 8 cents per kilowatt hour.  then they get solar pv at an average capacity factor of 26% at 2-4 cents per kilowatt hours.  of course, during the summer the capacity factor of solar increases and most of the power is needed during the day for ac.

meanwhile northern europe tends to have access wind power in the winter so they have district heating.  the store energy thermally underground.

any large buildings can also get really cheap ice storage.  they can also use geothermal for heating and cooling.

this video shows you know with a variety of technologies you dont really need that much storage.  texas is kind of ideal though because we have good solar.  wind in west texas is really strong at night.  wind on east gulf coast is consistently strong in the afternoon and evening.  in texas we need hardly any storage.

we have lots of desert so we could do solar thermal plus storage.  

it is interesting Texas a red state will probably go 100% renewable before most blue states.  it will export a ton of power.  

Texas I think is going to explode because it will have wind and solar for 1-2 cents per kilowatt.  also a lot of areas dont even have for profit utilities.  any smart companies especially in manufacturing will produce their own power or purchase it directly.

I didn't, everything is a matter of time. But in this case, a matter of time means the age of post scarcity which at the current rate is not coming. One of the biggest factors in why robots cost so much right now is manufacturing like I said, they take a long time to make, a lot of power to make, and expensive materials to make. The machines that make these parts can only make so many, lest you build more of the machines which are also not cheap, that limit makes them valuable. Think GPUs, there is a shortage because there are only so many they can make without risk of making too many, crypto is not a safe bet to rent out 2x the fabricators. People need to decide there is a need for mover bots before they get time on these machines.

&gt;Which rare metals are robots using that cost so much money

Gold and platinum are used in electronics. Titanium for structure, steel will likely be too heavy, aluminum wears out.

&gt;Someone needs to tell all the robot manufacturing companies that robots will always be way to expensive for anyone to use.

Atlas is funded by DARPA, the US military is one of the few entities that can afford tech like this.

Driving a truck offroad, like in a mine, is very different from trucking things into NYC, Beijing, or London. That is far more comparable to driving passengers from A - B, with far more variables, rules, regulations, and safety concerns.

Google for example has over a million miles of self-driving in relatively consistent conditions while they've trained their system in an attempt to expose it to as many events as possible. The more unique the situation the more likely it becomes that the AI fails to handle it correctly.

No they don't. That's just as dumb as claiming Tesla have self driving autonomous vehicles in use.

Level 1 &amp; 2 self driving are not autonomous at all. What Scania are testing is literally driving straight on a road.

Unless they massively changed their plans from 2017, they're testing tech extremely similar to Tesla's highway ""autopilot"" feature - literally driving straight on a highway and breaking/accelerating or swirving, when needed.

That's something Tesla started putting on roads in 2014, and the more autonomous version was on roads (in over 200k vehicles) in 2016.

Scania aren't some market leader, they are just another player in the game. Their latest ""big innovation"" was the idea of self driving trucks in a convoy - literally the equivalent of a train. Great idea to reduce fuel usage, but not a super novel idea, and it was being tested only in Singapore - not globally, like for example Tesla are doing.

It seems to me that the issues with self-driving technology are not inherent to AI. Humans can program decision trees that meet or surpass the quality of their own decision-making in real time.

As it stands, people can stand by for several minutes at a time, with no input, while their cars drive themselves. Maybe in five years, this will be thirty minutes?

352,upvotesthenrages,"&gt;There’s a BIG difference between what researchers say is “possible” and what is actually practical in the real world.

Yeah there is, but it's often far smaller than you think.

The amount of times I've heard people be extremely pessimistic about tech, software, or somebodies vision, and then be proven wrong to a ridiculous degree is extreme.

The reason Elon Musk is as popular as he is, is because he proved so many nay-sayers wrong. If Tesla failed in 2014, and SpaceX too, then he'd fall into obscurity and be used as an example of not to aim higher than what's ""realistic"".

Instead he practically dragged our species into the EV revolution, and he's almost singlehandedly made space exploration cool, viable, and actually have a real goal - something no other entity or person has managed to do since the 60s.

But if it were just him then I'd probably agree with you, but it's not. Every major car producer is saying the same thing: level 5 autonomous driving between 2029-2034.

That's Japan, EU, US, and Chinese companies. Are they all lying? Or is the field just moving way faster than you perhaps think?

&gt;AI just isn’t good at exception handling and humans are way better, ultimately cheaper, and more efficient at it.

Right now. Like you just said, it requires data, but also processing power. Both of those things have been growing exponentially for decades, and it's still growing.

And while exceptions are exceptions right now, once you've taught the AI what an exception is, then it's no longer unknown. Seeing as we have trillions and trillions of data points the ""exceptions"" will stop being exceptions ... they will just be rarer occurances.

&gt;Also AI is creating massive numbers of jobs - not just in the field of AI but data science, analytics, infrastructure, platforms, new apps, etc. To do AI accurately you need a huge amount of data, which typically requires cloud platforms. Depending on what it is there’s also a lot of IoT involved, etc etc. We are seeing large amounts of industries and resources being created as a result of AI. My job didn’t exist 5-10 years ago.

Definitely! I completely agree, but like you said: we are in the *extremely* early stages of automation.

We are literally pouring the foundation and figuring stuff out. But once things have been done they no longer require as much input.

Facial recognition is a good example. The amount of research, development, and resources that went into that field is astounding (for such a seemingly small task) - but as you can see today: the resources are now being invested elsewhere, because facial recognition is maturing.

There simply isn't a need to spend billions on it ... because we already figured out so much of it. The same thing is happening with cars.

In 2013 self driving vehicles were limited to planes, trains, and trucks in off-road environments.

Fast forward to 2019 and we have passenger vehicles avoiding collisions with driver interference. We have vehicles that change lanes and follow GPS on highway without any human input.

We have trucks that drive in a convoy and communicate while also handling obstacles and speed limitations.

That's just 6 years. Imagine what'll happen in 15 years.

Hell ... just look 15 years back in time. We barely even had digital cameras, and we most definitely didn't have any speech recognition that actually worked.",1555329160,ekxmyev,t1_ekxed1i,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2019

But in general someone still has to maintain the equipment. That’s at the most basic level. Now with the automobile industry as a whole I actually have quite a bit of information on that. So there’s a slow moving process called legislation that automation has to get last first. With department of transportation and OSHA regulations it would be difficult to ever take a driver from behind the wheel of a vehicle. Look at Tesla they are coming out with “self driving electric semi trucks”. They are very cool but there still has to be a licensed truck driver behind the wheel that can take over at any time. Also with current DOT regulations they have to have X number of hours of rest between driving times with a maximum of x number of drive hours in a week. Team driving is huge in the trucking industry so in reality there’s going to be 2 truck drivers in most interstate trucks unless they are a solo operation. 

There essentially always has to be a human hand involved somewhere even if all it is is someone to push the emergency stop button.

In typical American suburbia, roads are planned in a way that makes it almost impossible to service them effectively with any kind of public transit, since crucial connecting roads are missing, and everyone is forced to go the long way around. This means that the number of lines that are needed grows to be truly staggering, and if they are to be operated at any meaningful interval (30 minutes), then it would become prohibitively expensive. In European suburbia, all that is needed is usually a bus line to the nearest station, and even that is not always necessary since you're rarely more than 2 km from the nearest station, unless you're in a rural area.

If the car can evade, then another 1 or two cars would be needed to flank it so it can't escape. If law makers desire, they could make it mandatory to vehicle manufacturers to enable a system that would allow law enforcement to request certain cars to be disabled on demand. Here it gets more complicated as people will also oppose such laws as they could consider them too intrusive and could be used to harass dissidents or political rivals, the public would maybe view it close to warrantless searches.",1555612082,el7eze6,t3_bekwdy,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2019

Readers react to the news by thinking ‘Well, *I* would never make that mistake while driving. If an autonomous vehicle can mess up something as simple as that, what else can it mess up?’ Which is partially a valid complaint.

With human drivers, we tend to know where the edge-cases that cause accidents lie: bad weather, alcohol, distraction, etc. And while autonomous vehicles aren’t prone to as many ‘human’ errors, they’re so complex that we *don’t know* where their edge-cases are.

&amp;#x200B;

AI is not going to suddenly burst onto the scene like in *Terminator*, an intelligent, reasoning lifeform capable of high-level goal formation and implementing strategy. Also, there's an enormous difference between ""general artificial intelligence"" and the kinds of AI that researchers are currently experimenting with. It's probably extremely inaccurate to imagine that ""AI"" is a new kind of lifeform that we're growing in a lab, and that once we ""get it right,"" it will blossom into a sentient entity with a lifecycle that develops in unimaginable ways, free to choose its own goals and possibly decide to eradicate humanity.

&amp;#x200B;

Most modern AIs are extremely purpose-built. I think most are built on neural nets -- a blend of software and sometimes special hardware that is capable of ""learning"" in a very narrow definition of the term.

&amp;#x200B;

Researchers train each AI to be able to perform a specific task. A task is something like ""be able to identify crosswalks in photos"" or ""keep a mechanical robot upright."" None of them have the kind of general learning capability that biological animals have. Regardless of our opinions about the nature of sentience, there is absolutely zero chance that any of these systems could gain knowledge about the world or form their own goals. The truth is that ""raising"" these AIs is an extremely labor-intensive task. We have to feed them enormous amounts of training data before they can make even the most rudimentary ""decisions.""

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a true story. A while back, the US Army wanted to create a computer that could spot enemy soldiers armed with anti-tank rockets hiding in bushes. So, they hired a crew to stage scenarios and take 10,000 photos. In some of the photos, an actor was hiding in a bush with a rocket. In other photos, there was no actor. They showed a photo to the computer and asked it to decide if there was a soldier with a rocket. The first time, it basically chose randomly. Then, the humans told it whether it was right or wrong, which resulted in tiny adjustments to the weights of the neural nodes that contributed to the decision. They repeated this with all 10,000 photos. At the end, the system had gotten pretty good at ""predicting"" the correct answer. So, then they tested it against real footage from actual warzones -- scenes it had never seen before. It failed miserably. Why? It turns out that the film crew that created the training photos had taken all the ""combatant"" photos on a cloudy day, and all the ""no combatant"" photos on a sunny day. The Army thought it had trained a computer to identify soldiers with rockets, but they'd actually trained a computer to identify cloudy days. Hopefully, this illustrates that there is no reason to believe an AI has the same understanding of the world that we have. So, I tend to call these things ""expert systems"" rather than AIs, because their capabilities are so laser-focused.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a greater danger that you will accidentally construct a life-size replica of the Eiffel Tower in your backyard than there is that any of these systems will spontaneously undergo self-directed cognitive development and become hostile. It is never going to happen that all the self-driving cars suddenly become self-aware and form political goals.

&amp;#x200B;

What is more likely is that humans will design a neural expert system to do something like trade commodities on the stock exchange, and when they hook it up, it'll make decisions they don't like because its understanding of reality is so unmoored from objective reality that it causes havoc by optimizing for the wrong things, or reacts poorly when it encounters a scenario that it doesn't recognize from its training.

&amp;#x200B;

The ""next stage"" of evolution -- a fanciful phrase, to be sure -- is probably going to come out of genetic research. Technologies like CRISPR might lead to a world in which the elite hand-edit the genes of their offspring to improve their basic physical and mental capacity. Those changes will be passed on to *their* children, and unless they somehow flunk out of the upper class, they'll presumably hand-edit the genes of their own children.

&amp;#x200B;

Because humans are very bad at paying attention to things. Our minds wander on their own, ergo the less a human brain has to pay attention to accomplish a given task, the more likely it is that they'll stop paying attention in any given moment.

Is about as far as I'm comfortable with, but at the same time I don't use cruise control because I actually like driving. Cruise control also doesn't override user commands; the moment you touch the brakes (or the clutch, in my car), it disengages instantly.

&gt;Also what if you need to take control of the self-driving car for any reason?

Chances are, if it's fully-self driving, people won't be able to react in time entirely because they won't be paying attention. It would be better for the car to handle everything.

So how much safer do you think they're going to get when you take away safety responsibilities from them?

If the human brain doesn't get enough stimulus, it wanders to something else. As it turns out, driving manually engages enough of the human brain such that it doesn't wander. But if you start taking away responsibilities, and the brain is needed less and less, the brain wanders more and more, and thus the entire system becomes **less** safe.

Again; fully autonomous is fine, no autonomy is fine, but the middle zone is dangerous.",1555960056,elikns0,t1_elijfwz,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2019

490,yakri,"Yeah absolutely. However let's not sell short how fucking cool that actually is, nor the practical applications (*provided you achieve a minimum level of accuracy).

Aside from the fact that typing with your mind is pretty dope, what is considerably more badass is being able to map an arbitrarily large number of functions into a single ""keypress."" So instead of having to press something like ctrl+alt+s you potentially just learn a lot more actions than there are available keyboard buttons in theory.

Now if the technology is good enough, you can also do it faster than you could type physically.

So really just easier hotkey presses, easier macro activation, and easier general typing. Sped up both by the technology and lack of awkward potential finger positioning (hopefully).

So yeah, it's just mind-typing, but there's a hope here that maybe you could increase the speed you do things by maybe 20-30%, that's pretty insane if it ever becomes possible.


The applications of just ""better typing but without a keyboard"" become considerably more awesome when you add in a VR headset and maybe a cramped space where a laptop would suck to us.

My dream is being able to have a triple monitor desktop setup with better typing than my fancy mechanical keyboard in the size of a moderately clunky VR headset, maybe a hardware and battery pack (or smartphone) and something else the size of a wrist or headband. Not exactly the sleek vision of the future you expect from sci-fi, but it would be pretty awesome to be able to code with high efficiency or write a book from the discomfort of some manner of long distance public transit, or a self driving car.


From a more entertainment perspective, you can turn two simple tracking devices plus this into a better VR control system than anything currently on the market for video games as well.


Whether or not neural link will actually live up to the input fidelity required to actually make this all happen remains to be seen though.",1555965505,elitcyr,t1_eli5f0i,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2019

494,Diskiplos,"Eh, the problem is we're really comparing apples and hummingbirds here. Sure, the human brain is unparalleled insofar as any invented computer system. We don't even have sight of when we'll land on a full artificial intelligence rivaling the human brain. But a self driving car isn't being judged on its ability to write poems and guess what birthday present Joe really wants. At no point is the human brain fully optimized or even fully dedicated to the activity of driving. And even though it can perform tons of calculations really fast, most of those are completely unhelpful to driving.

And for all it's great at, the human brain hits limits very fast. We have at most two eyes. We accentuate that with mirrors to move that vision quickly, but a self driving car can be made to see in all directions at once. The human brain has a certain level of reaction time that just can't compare to a purpose-built computer. And most brains don't have the learned software to accurately estimate speed, distance, and mass the way that a self driving car could. And that's a brain at peak capacity failing to measure up. Throw teenage hormones, alcohol, tiredness, old age, or even just low blood sugar at a brain and watch it lose effectiveness. A computer *can't* have those problems. The truth is that a computer can be much dumber than the human brain and still be an equal match when it comes to driving, because all that mental hardware humans have is designed to control our entire lives, not just our driving, and it has inherent disadvantages when compared to a driving computer.",1555988660,eljodwf,t1_eljhls3,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2019

* Full self driving by the end of this year
* Robotaxi car sharing service so your car can go work while you're not using it. Half the price of Uber and 70% profit share to owner of the car. 
* Building the cars with 1 million mile lifespans, including the batteries
* Promising to ""delete"" the steering wheel in a few years since it'll be obsolete. [Here's the official render](https://i.imgur.com/mQPpKY0.png)
* Oh yeah Elon *hates* LIDAR, unless it's on a spaceship

I hope they can do all that (besides deleting the steering wheel, I like my manual controls lol) though I still remain skeptical they'll hit all those points next year like they're promising. Regulators are going to be going bananas. 

But it sure looks like they'll be able to do it at any rate. They showed off their scratch built computer with some impressive neural performance, talked about their neural training techniques, and also took people for test rides where the cars automatically did what they did in this video. Impressive stuff, looking forward to seeing what happens next.",1555995016,eljvdyy,t3_bgaucr,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2019
499,ZombieAlpacaLips,"Gridlock is mostly due to humans. You can fit way more cars on the road if they're all self-driving. Also, you can make cities denser since cars can drive away to park themselves, eliminating the need for parking lots/garages and street parking. Denser cities means that walking and public transit are better options too, further reducing the need for cars. If taxis are all self-driving, you eliminate the need to pay a driver, so taxi fares fall and usage increases; fewer people then need to own a car. Self-driving taxis may then be replaced by vans or mini-buses; you hail one with your phone and dispatch finds one that's already headed your way, and you hop in with a few other passengers.",1555995277,eljvmtx,t1_eljuina,Futurology,t5_2t7no,2019
