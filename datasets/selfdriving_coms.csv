21,sdcsighted,"I still feel like you are criticizing the SAE levels because you don’t understand them and you don’t understand their purpose. They are very simple, but I feel like people criticize them when they look to apply them in additional situations for which they are not intended (eg performance/utility/etc.) and end up disappointed.

If you disagree, then can you please elaborate on why you think they are a “flawed system” when considering them only in the context of the application for which they were intended?

One reason for them is liability when these features are deployed. It has been theorized (not yet proven AFAIK) that L0-2 means the human is liable, whereas L3-5 means the manufacturer is liable (technically the manufacturer of the feature, not of the car, if they are different).

Another is to have a clear taxonomy for regulators. In CA, for example, you need a permit to test L3-5 features, but you don’t need a permit to test/deploy L0-2 features.

I do agree that they are simple and vague; for example, knowing that a given feature is L4 doesn’t tell you much about it. But some people see L4 and think that it means it’s “better” than a L2 feature, and that’s not the case at all. If you think there should be an additional classification system that deals with performance or utility, then sure, I think it would be useful. But the fact that the current SAE levels are completely independent of that is not a reason why they should be retracted, IMHO. They are good at what they do; they specify the different roles and responsibilities of the feature vs the human.

&gt; He did say that and when pressed, he uttered the word ""L5""....I'll try to find the reference in the video.

Sure, if you can find it, then please share it. What I heard was a journalist asking him if he meant L5 and he said yes (this was in the Q&amp;A at Autonomy Day). And it was always supposed to be “feature complete” by the end of the year, not released. If you have a quote from Elon that says released by the end of the year, please share it. 

&gt; Because I thought you were saying it's manufacture intent and not features.  I'm fine with it being L2, just trying to understand who gets to say what it is.

I said that the manufacturer decides the level, because the level depends on the design intention of a given feature. 

[Note: When I say “feature” I mean a “driving automation system feature” as defined by SAE J3016, not the colloquial definition of features, which are attributes of something.]

Tesla’s NoA feature is L2. It doesn’t matter that Tesla’s future roadmap moonshot goal as a company is to deploy a L5 feature; each feature has a unique design intention, and therefore has a corresponding level. 

Tesla has done L3-5 testing in the past. And they may be doing so with prototype features currently as well.",1571169975,f3v0l6q,t1_f3urpkc,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw
22,WeldAE,"&gt; It’s a taxonomy that everyone can use and understand. 

I think this isn't true and is the thrust of my point.  I think there is ample evidence that almost no one understands it so I think the burden of proof would be on your side.  I suspect you will find maybe two tech oriented news sites and a bunch of engineering organizations that truly understand it.

&gt; The alternative is having each manufacturer use their own meaningless buzzwords

This is a false choice.  Today we have SAE + buzzwords.  I'm suggesting that SAE is losing badly to the buzzwords because it's useless for most purposes and no one even understands it.  Even authors that understand it on the new side sped 50% of their article talking about it and the reader thinks they have received information but really nothing was said because the SAE doesn't describe anything of use.

&gt; then what would you propose that it look like?

That would be up to an organization to figure out.  I can point out a flawed system without fixing it and still make a valid point.  I think you covered some good tests idea further down in your response where you said what the SAE didn't cover; Performance, utility, etc.

&gt; ll that matters is the feature controls lateral and longitudinal motion but the human has to be in charge of OEDR in both your Infiniti and your Tesla.

I get that this is what SAE does, what I don't get is why this is useful.  It's like classifying cars by how many seats and types of restraints they have but not talking about the rest of the car.  Nothing wrong with that exactly, but it isn't something anyone should be using on a regular basis.  It would be like reading a car review where they painstakingly explain the seat standards and then finish with a few paragraphs about the rest of the car.

&gt; No, Elon said that they will be feature complete by the end of the year. Release date sometime next year.

He did say that and when pressed, he uttered the word ""L5""....I'll try to find the reference in the video.

&gt; Then why would you think that means that their current features are L0?

 1. Use a message-passing API that only supports a small set of requests ( go(location), wait(time), set_current_customer(ID), something like that). Then give the communication system unprivileged access only.
 2. Process all communications first via hardware into valid API requests.

And you also can't prove that it's not possible to accomplish, either.

All I know for sure is that Waymo have a self driving car with lidar that they have currently started using in production without human safety drivers. Tesla are a bit behind that, and I've not seen any actual working evidence that they have something approaching level 4 self driving. Tesla has made promises a few times about when they will have full self driving which have not materialised on their timescale. And this is such a difficult and complex problem that you really can't confidently state that you will be able to achieve something specific until you've pretty much already achieved it.

I think these are just the current facts of the matter.

But we basically know at this point that lidar is a current working solution to the level 4 self driving problem. And at the same time we don't know of anyone that has solved the problem without it.

The difference between my L2 Infinity and my L2 Tesla might as well be the difference between shoes and a car for getting you around.

Consumers sure don't care.  There is cruise, dynamic cruise and a bunch of gimic features that don't work....with the exception being the Tesla.  People still think the Tesla just has dynamic cruise until I explain what it can actually do.

Why not?  They are causing active harm and confusion.  They can put it in the manual or release notes in fine print, but build something else that makes sense for marketing purposes.  Retract them as a publicly used standard.

It's clear you need a map of the parking lot. Not necessarily a stored map, but at least one you are creating on the fly.

Honestly, I've always wanted to solve this problem in a different way. You need to understand the environment beyond the vehicles sensors, so raise the sensors. Use a small drone that gets launched to see the lot from an overhead view. Drone, isn't needed for most driving, but from overhead you can probably understand a parking lot, and predict movement of people and cars very easily. You launch it in parking lots or around construction or an accident.

On the other hand maybe you can do a grid to vehicle thing where there are cameras everywhere and any vehicle can tap into the video of feed. Processing is still all done on board, but you can always grab a camera feeds from around the lot or from around the corner, to add an additional sensor.

Right now car ownership is a major expense for Americans.  And for low to middle income Americans it can be a major source of anxiety as repair bills, car payments, and other transportation issues can cause them employment issues.   TAAS can replace the economic model of car ownership, and insurances, maintenance,  and other expenses of ownership.  A transmission going out can very quickly a struggling person and increase their debt by thousands of dollars.    TAAS has the potential to save the average American family several thousand dollars per year.  Tony Seba's figures are $5000 in savings per year per household in the US.   That $5000 will get either saved or spent elsewhere.   If the vast majority of people give up car ownership for TAAS that would result in trillions of dollars being spent elsewhere in the economy.    


Trillions of dollars in spending creates jobs.   In my city that would be $500M of spending elsewhere in the economy.   The people who lose their jobs due to this automation will need to be retrained for a new line of work, however they will be looking or a new line of work in an expanding economy.   If the safety results are as optimistic about the projections it will result in huge amounts of money that are currently being spent on dealing with injuries and deaths (40,000 deaths per year x $1M per death = $40B in savings).    


When we transitioned from horses to cars, a lot of people went out of work, but the economic gains were far larger, we created entire new industries at a far faster rate than jobs were lost.  The big quality of life increase that Americans received in the 1950s would not have been possible in a horse drawn economy.   People often hold up the 1950s as peak economic prosperity for the US and don't realize that those years came right after a major technological shift which made a lot of people lose their job.    


  
Politically people will come up with solutions.  I predict the long term will be a UBI.

150,Ambiwlans,"I mean, we did radically change economic systems though. Unions, welfare, workers' rights, minimum wage, overtime ... ending slavery, child labour. Mandatory education, nowadays this is extending through the 20s.

The agricultural revolution killed a huge percentage of jobs, call it 80%. We adapted with ease! Keep in mind, that worldwide, this revolution took maybe 1500 years.

The industrial revolution killed lots of jobs too! Took maybe 75~200 years depending on the scope. We adapted.... sort of. The job market became an issue. But there were greater socialist tendencies then, unions were created, social nets were formed. The revolution without worker protections could have been pretty devastating. People had to retrain, and the change took a few years but there was space for low skilled workers to move to respectably.

Now, we are part way through the computer/electronic revolution, entering the internet revolution. We are having things like 'jobless recoveries' from a relatively benign depression (It took 10 full years for the employment rate to recover to the pre-2008 levels). The value of labor as a share of income is the lowest it has been since we started tracking this (in the 40s). And new jobs from the electronic revolution have already been killed by the computer revolution, some jobs lasting less than a couple decades. The class divide is rapidly growing, the US GINI ranking amongst mediocre African nations. Long term *frictional* unemployment is now commonplace where this had never existed in past. People are training for jobs that exist for a decade. But I mean, we are muddling through.

The coming revolution(s?) is a different thing altogether. The internet/network revolution is still coming in to full swing. But we are about to come into an AI revolution. And a genetics/medication revolution, a nanotech revolution. And possibly a space revolution and a power revolution. The rate of change is increasing so quickly that modern historians aren't even sure what to call this period. Future jobs may be automated faster than people can be trained. 1 year to train an industry, 8 months to code one? Easy decision. Has this ever happened before? People are now talking about half of jobs over the next *10~20 years*! And that is very mainstream economic estimates.

So, while generally, jobs vanishing is something that has happened before, it has been over time-frames many magnitudes larger.

The thinking that ""this too shall pass, there is nothing new under the sun"" is similar to the following line of thinking:

 - I got hit by a tennis ball and lived

 - I got hit by a cyclist and lived

 - I got hit by a car and maybe had to be hospitalized but lived

Therefor I have no need to worry about this 16 wheeler doing 120. Clearly, I've demonstrated my ability to survive being hit by stuff.

- It is based on a common economic fallacy that money is zero-sum, and if we stop rich people from getting it, it'll just redirect elsewhere. 

- It will lead to capital flight. People will move their business activities to countries that do not do this 

- Even if you solve the capital flight problem, it will actually reduce the taxation you collect from these people. Memes about ""the rich are not taxed"" aside, the top 1% of earners actually pay about 40% of income tax receipts in the US, or as much as the bottom 90% combined. People are not going to engage in unprofitable behaviour, so you're not going to have people busting their asses and taling risks to make more money just to see 90% of it evaporate.

&gt;At first, most of Waymo's driverless cars will have an employee in the back observing the vehicle's behavior. If something goes really wrong, they'll be able to push the ""pull over"" button to stop the car. In the coming months, participants in Waymo's early rider program will start getting the option to ride in fully driverless vehicles.

&gt;Some time after that, Waymo will launch a commercial driverless taxi service that's open to members of the general public in the Phoenix metropolitan area and beyond.

However by going autonomous and electric they can drastically reduce the cost of a ride compared to Uber/Lyft and even car ownership.   People have the option of ride sharing today, but they are paying for driver labor and gasoline expenses.  The fare can be drastically cheaper when you remove the driver pay.    


At scale, this service can be cheaper than driving your existing car and drastically cheaper than buying a new one.   Money talks.  The Average American household doesn't have $1000 in savings and typically expects to go into major debt to afford a car.  This system would allow people to get around cheap, especially in cities where parking is a major expense, and thus would not need to own cars.

I agree that it is a bit confusing having a safety driver in a L4 prototype. I had a back-and-forth discussion/debate about this here a while ago that lasted for weeks.

Ultimately the feature is still designed to perform the full DDT + fallback. But they are not yet confident in its performance, so they put in a safety driver as a backup/failsafe (often for backup OEDR). 

The best analogy I came up with was one of those drivers training cars with the pedals or even steering wheels on the passenger side. The kid in the drivers seat is still the “driver” and is the one responsible if the car gets into an accident, even though the instructor in the passenger seat is watching for dangerous situations and can even slam on the brakes if necessary.

The person I was debating with was saying the same thing that you’re saying, basically that the safety driver in a L4 prototype is performing part of the DDT, so it’s L2.

It wasn’t in there at the time, but SAE addressed this explicitly in the latest rev of J3016.

&gt; (throwaway account to protect friends at Waymo) data points of 2: 1. took a ride, at one point a sudden violent sewering and breaking for no apparent reason - explanation from the backup driver - the truck in the next lane was too close. Then it couldn't take a left turn into the parking lot in front of Waymo HQ and was just stuck even though the maneuver was simplest to anyone. remote driver couldn't do it anything and backup driver had to do the 'normal driving'. 2: spoke to someone (again a waymo employee and her friend) just after the ride and the friend was visibly shaken and verbatim expression ""worst ride of my life"".

384,borisst,"&gt; It’s just a way for the manufacturer to convey the design intention of a feature to others, and to specify the responsibilities of the feature vs the human. That’s it. 

But it doesn't (with the design intent section). DRIVEN development cars are supposedly L4, so the humans should have no responsibilities, but in reality, they have a safety driver or two to keep it moving, and to keep it safe.

&gt; That’s it. You can’t look at the SAE level and get an accurate idea of the performance of a given feature, and that’s not the purpose of the SAE levels.

Without taking performance into account, every system can be at any level at the say so of the manufacturer.

&gt; L4 is not definitively “better” than L2; they are just different. But some people see L4 and think that it means something very specific.

My point is that with the design intent section, it has no meaning.

&gt; I’ve mentioned this before, but there could be a hypothetical released/deployed L4 feature that works only on a straight one-mile stretch of one road, under 25 mph, and only between the hours of noon and 1pm on sunny days.

We already have that with Daimler and Bosch [announcing](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/23/daimler-and-boschs-driverless-parking-feature-can-legally-operate-without-human-supervision/) L4 in a single parking lot. 

It's kinda stupid, but at least it has a clear meaning.

&gt; Hypothetically, there could also be Navigate on Autopilot that is able to be used on any public road, but still requiring the human for partial OEDR.

That would still require a human in the loop to be safe so it's L2. That's a clear description of the responsibilities of the human and the system.

&gt; The fact that it’s L4 just means the human doesn’t have to perform any of the DDT nor DDT Fallback while the feature is engaged.

But in a DRIVEN development car, an alert human has to monitor the system at all times. In other words, the human performs the actual DDT, not the DDT fallback, because the human has to monitor it in real-time, not just wait for a request to intervene. 

It's completely meaningless to call it L4.",1570693835,f35w2tg,t1_f34pt8b,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

387,TomasTTEngin,"Happy to make bets. I'm a big fan of statistics and of gambling. 

Let me clarify what I mean by ""ready"". I'm using the term in a sense where I mean it meets their risk preferences. I believe every company will have different risk preferences and i expect waymo to be among the more risk averse.

I'd guess they are ""ready"" because they have got the risk per trip down to a level where if they do a limited number of trips, the chance of a crash manifesting among that small fleet is extremely low. 

e.g. risk of a single car crashing on a single trip is one in one hundred million.

Continuing that hypothetica example, if they run ten cars on driverless for five trips a day for a month, (1500 trips) they can be 99.9985% sure of not having a crash. [As 0.999985 = (1-(1/100,000,000))^1500]

Obviously, the larger the fleet hey run, the higher the chance of a crash manifesting. There are two ways of reducing your total risk - one is reducing the crash risk of the technology and the other is limiting the size of your fleet.

I think the ""I told you so's"" belong to the naysayer nation so far. Two years ago people told me I was naive and foolish to think that Waymo wasn't really sending out empty cars to get passengers in Chandler. Major publications believed that Waymo would launch a driverless robotaxi service open to anyone in Chandler during 2018. No one seemed to question Elon Musk when he said Teslas would be able to drive themselves empty across the USA by the beginning of 2018 ""charging themselves along the way"".

I'm truly excited and happy if Waymo is finally going to start sending out empty cars routinely in Chandler.

You can’t look at the SAE level and get an accurate idea of the performance of a given feature, and that’s not the purpose of the SAE levels. 

L4 is not definitively “better” than L2; they are just different. But some people see L4 and think that it means something very specific.

I’ve mentioned this before, but there could be a hypothetical released/deployed L4 feature that works only on a straight one-mile stretch of one road, under 25 mph, and only between the hours of noon and 1pm on sunny days. 

The fact that it’s L4 just means the human doesn’t have to perform any of the DDT nor DDT Fallback while the feature is engaged. 

Hypothetically, there could also be Navigate on Autopilot that is able to be used on any public road, but still requiring the human for partial OEDR.

You say it's a prototype. That you **hope** it will be capable of operating without human intervention, or **wish** it will. 

&gt; Even Waymo still has people in the driver's seat to take over when absolutely necessary.

Waymo are one the worst offenders with their PR.

&gt; Honest question. Are all those we see today a level 3? a level 3.5? They're intended to be level 4 systems. But they're in development and not fully deployed. Do we call them ""In development level 4 service?"" Seems wordy.

No.

Level 3 means the car drives itself (in some Operational Design Domain, ODD), but it can request the driver to intervene. The car must be able to drive itself safely for at least a few seconds. That basically means that a level 3 car must be able to handle a pedestrian walking into the road (as described int the article) without human intervention.

Level 4 means that car drives it self in some ODD. It cannot rely on the user to intervene even if requested.

&gt; BTW, does that mean Tesla is L5 since that is what they are aiming to deploy?

First of all, the levels apply to features, not vehicles or manufacturers. So your question does not really make sense. A given company, or even a given vehicle can have different features with different SAE levels.

They also only apply to features in use on public roadways. So a hypothetical feature being tested on a private test track technically has no SAE level.

Capability or performance or reliability etc. has nothing to do with the SAE levels according to J3016.

A L4 prototype is actually still considered L4. The design intention of the feature is the only thing that defines the level. Thus, the manufacturer defines the level.

But since it is still being tested, they may not have confidence in its performance. So they put a safety driver in as a failsafe.

A released/deployed L4 feature, however, would likely mean that they have full confidence in its performance within the ODD.

This means self-driving vehicles will still stop at the 4-way stop intersection where a drunk human driver mowed down a stop sign.

This means self-driving vehicles can also have planned updates for planned changes to roads.

City decides to update the speed limit from 4th Ave to 7th Ave on Thursday? The required notice is released, the change is made, the signs for humans are put up, and the self-driving vehicles should already have the update in place queued and ready.

I really can't say I believe in map-less self-driving vehicles.

There are too many vulnerabilities and issues that would arise ranging anywhere from the aforementioned issue of missing signs, illegible signs, snow covered signs, vandalized signs, kids printing stop signs and waving them around on the side of the road, etc.",1570575885,f31hzqj,t1_f2xsj9k,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

559,WeldAE,"&gt; This matters for inter-metro transport, but not intra-metro. 

Not really.  Where there are geographic limitations like the East River or a bay or sound then sure.  However, most US cities are not so limited and the fact that there is open land open beyond a metro draws people to it for costs reasons.  Remember, less than 50% of adults work and don't need daily access to the core city.  In large metros, the CBD working population is below 1M people.

&gt; The law bans denser forms in most residential land in the US, even in major cities.

This was certainly true in the past but is becoming less so.  I can only speak for Atlanta since I live here and keep up with it.  The city of Atlanta now allows out building apartments with no zone review.  There is no minimum parking requirement for any building.  In the suburbs, the cities fight against commercial development and encourage residential development.  There appears to be no limit on density allowed.  

All recent developments have been high density house of 50% apartments, 30% town homes and 20% SFH with no lot line.  This is obliviously just the common.  We had one development with 60 SFH on 4 acres that didn't make it because it required a $2m bridge be built.   That development had no streets, just one way alleys.  The city has basically no say in what can be built as GA is highly a property rights state.

No one hand coded or hand labeled what curbs are, or what the edge of the road looks like. You can use GAN to match the output of the perception system to the real world ground truth image.

This model isn't classifying anything in the scene. It's just a 1024 dimensional vector. Hopefully that makes sense. It's an exciting way to tackle self driving!",1570471223,f2wx4vp,t1_f2wtq86,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

The full context:

on top of that, the average cost of car ownership in England is nearly 4000 quid, but that goes up even more if you're living 2-3 hours away. meanwhile, everyone in the city is taking an Uber-pool to anywhere the tube doesn't run and will have a fraction of the transportation cost.  


so, maybe the people who only live in the city because commuting is too boring will move farther away, but others might be drawn into the greener, or serene city.

I believe autonomous shared shuttles should be the priority of cities once self driving tech takes off. even just having 3 passengers per vehicles would make a huge difference to pollution and traffic chaos (occupancy is currently 1.2-1.5, typically).

the problem with doing those kinds of tolls now is that our public transportation sucks, so taking 1 kid to daycare, another to school, then going to work is just not possible for most people on public transit; it's a necessity, not a luxury. once you have autonomous vehicles, you can subsidize/toll based on occupancy without creating a hardship for the poor. using my above example, you start with an occupancy of 3 on the way to the daycare, then 2 on the way to school, then the individual adult can choose to either pay extra to go directly to work as a single occupant, or do some shared arrangement, either pooling or taking a mini-bus. if a city raises single-occupant tolls and subsidize pooled ridership, then pooling or shuttle buses should become MUCH more efficient because the ease of matching two requested routes goes up exponentially with the number of people using such a system.",1570139833,f2cmbk4,t1_f25hk8q,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

Step 2: Have the millions of shippers rush to your door to be 1st in line to lower distribution cost and increase safety.

A self driving truck never gets tired and never needs to stop.  Right there is a massive value proposition for a shipping company.  Even if the SDT costs the same as a human driven truck per mile its a win.  But given that driver wage is a very significant portion of the trucking cost per mile SDTs it should also (eventually) cost less than a human driven truck.

Having customers at this stage is really about trying to make some income instead of driving the trucks around empty.  Google has enough stuff moving around the country they dont need to take on customers, they also have enough money that the revenue from a few trucks probably isnt worth the hassle.

Basically it's basing path and position on the road off of millions of miles of driving data gathered and trained into a model. Taking the image it sees from the camera and generating a new image based on the model training and then using that output as a guide for path prediction in the real world. 

So it's kinda like asking what you as a human rely on when driving on a road with no markings.

If EVs become widespread before SDC fleets hit scale, this will further delay their appeal.  It won't stop them but it will slow down adoption as EVs are super cheap to operate per mile.  I have an expensive one and I estimate it will cost me $0.18/mile to operate over 10 years for example.

&gt; Now, figuring out what it costs to own and operate a private vehicle has too many variables for me to figure out any kind of average for the US,

It's $0.55/mile on the low end.  This is a widely accepted average. If you own a luxury car it will be higher and if you buy used and run it into the ground it will be lower.

Transit engineers only talk about max capacity of people a system can move per hour but outside of NYC it's not possible to max out any transit system.

There may be certain times where its cheaper, easier, and/or more convenient to use the service.  Such as places where parking is an issue and the trip may only cost you a few bucks.   You could do the math and figure perhaps you won't be buying a new car as frequent, or your family will just be a single car family.   There could be situations where the SDC ride is $3 to your destination, but parking your own car is $10.  So you take the SDC.   You would also likely delay your next car purchase as the SDC service lets you drive less and almost certainly you will not be able to justify paying full price for a brand new gas powered car a few years from now.    


For people who do not own a car, or own an old gas car, they will have a few options.  If TAAS is 1/5th the cost of an Uber ride, which I see as being totally reasonable after a bit of market saturation.     Does a person without a car decide to take on the responsibility, the debt, and the expense of new car ownership or do they just use TAAS, which may end up being cheaper anyway?  If the monthly expenses of TAAS is 20% cheaper than car ownership, a significant portion of people are going to give up driving, especially if they currently do not own a car.    


In big cities, parking is expensive, I personally know people who have lived in San Francisco and paid $400-$500 per month to park their car.  In NYC I know folks who tell me that a private rental space is $600-$1000 per month.   In suburbia it is not such a problem, but in downtown districts it most certainly is, and if parking is more expensive than the SDC ride, people won't pay to park.  Eventually cities will reclaim parking lots and parking structures into more useful things, such as high density housing, so downtown will become a place with even less parking making car ownership less useful.",1570081751,f295nia,t1_f26izer,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

957,rileyoneill,"While perhaps not publicly owned, TAAS will be mass transit and in the majority of cities in America will not bother building up a massive new mass transit system only to be disrupted by TAAS.  Only already very dense communities may justify operating their existing mass transit, most cities will see their ridership plummet and have to re-invent their system.    


Mass transit moves slowly.  Not just as in the buses are slow, but the political process of expanding, funding, planning, and building something like a new light rail can take a very long time.  Several years.  Realistically, there could be more time that goes by between now, and a new mass transit line going through this process, than between now and TAAS coming online for most cities in America.    


Most city bus systems are going to be disrupted though. In my city, 330,000 people, Southern California, there are a few lines which have regular service, multiple times per hour, and then most lines come by once per hour and the buses are typically 80% empty.  They exist more or less as a public service to help people get around but transport and insignificant portion of the population around.  When those riders can use TAAS they will drop riding these lines even more (to the point where a bus that seats 50 goes from having 10 people on board to 2-3 people).   There has been talks about building light rail to replace the most used line (3x per hour, 4x during rush hour), the conversation seemed to start in 2013 but I don't think there is any plan regarding approval, funding, and everything it actually takes to pull the trigger on construction.",1570032895,f278pf2,t1_f24qw3m,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

990,rileyoneill,"I don't think that 1/5th and Uber ride is too unrealistic, I could even justify 1/10th of an Uber ride.    


First.  If the SDC gets 3 miles per KWH (Tesla Model 3 gets 3.5-4), and a KWH is 10 cents, then its 3 cents per mile.    If the fleet company charges the cars using excess solar/wind power or on site solar/wind power then the price per KWH will drop considerably (many energy analysts are figuring that in many markets solar will be over producing and thus need a sink, charging fleet cars could be that sink.  Solar is growing at 40% per year.)   Its not out of the question that the energy cost for a SDC could be 1 cent per mile.  So even if the fleet company was charging 30 cents per mile + some pickup/service fee + modest monthly membership they would be drastically undercutting lyft/uber.      


If SDC is 20% cheaper than Lyft/Uber they won't immediately replace car ownership, but the will replace a Lyft/Uber ride.   In that particular marketplace Lyft/Uber will be immediately disrupted.   There is no driver to pay, no driver to tip, The  SDC will be electric and not gas powered.   When this hits the market its going to fuck up the Uber model on day 1.   They do not need to focus on replacing car ownership on day 1, just replacing Uber rides as they start to scale.    


The fleet services can lease parking/service stations from both private owners and municipalities.   So all of the costs of parking would be divided up by all the people that one car serves that month (even in a place like NYC where parking spaces are $600-$1000 per month) to where it would be fairly cheap ($30 per day, and in a place like NYC I could imagine these cars are constantly busy so $30 per day would be minor).    


I see this as several different price points.    


Price Point A - Any Price - $500 per ride, but it works.  This replaces nothing and is nothing more than a tech demo.    
Price Point B - Cheaper than a comparable Lyft/Uber ride.  This replaces Lyft and Uber.  But not car ownership. Price Point C - Cheaper than purchasing a new car.  Still cheaper to drive your paid off car but financially buying a new car is too expensive.     
Price Point D - Cheaper than parking in downtown or other congested areas.  You still drive your own car when it works for you but if you have to deal with parking issues you will just opt for the SDC for that particular trip.   
Price Point E -  A family may only need 1 car,  they can sell all the others and use the SDC service most of the time, but still own a car for the trips where that car has an advantage.   
Price Point F - Cheaper than owning any gas powered car.   A car at this point would serve some hobby or recreational purpose.  Such as a Rivian Adventure Vehicle.  90% of consumers in the US aren't interested in spending money on this.  When you pencil all your monthly expenses with owning a gas car, your insurance, maintenance,  parking, gasoline,  and your SDC costs would be substantially less, people will make the switch.    


  
While people may hold on to their cars for a while, they won't be buying new gas powered cars.  If 10% of drivers decide to sell a car and not replace it (which could be a 2 car family going to a 1 car family) that would be a flood of \~30,000,000 used cars on the market.  Prices on used gas cars are going to majorly crash in these conditions.   And with a huge market of used gas cars, very few consumers will justify paying some massive premium for a brand new gasser when they can pick up a fairly new used one for 10 cents on the dollar.  Price point C is where new car sales decline and the car industry goes into a death spiral.   Even if people drive their old cars, and buy one of the cheap used cars on the market, the car companies, which depend on new car sales, will be in serious trouble.  I think people's attitudes towards spending a lot of money on a new car, especially a gasser, will erode when they see that they lose all of their value in a very short period of time.    


As far as American geography, match it with demographics.  10 million people live in Los Angeles County, Nearly 20 million people live in the Greater Los Angeles area.   That is the same population as like the 15 most rural states combined.    50% of the US population lives in just 10 states.

6,WeldAE,"&gt; One thing I like about this article is that it considers the possibility that people will own their own self-driving vehicles.

True, this is rare.  While I don't agree this is how it will be in the future, I enjoy reading about what the logistics would be if such a future existed.

&gt; ...at least in most of the US and Canada, the distances are too far and the parking is too plentiful for a car service to completely take over from private vehicles.

Not sure about Canada, but this is absolutely not true for 95% of the US population.  Only 20% of people live in what is considered ""rural"" areas.  In fact, only 2% live in what would be considered ""Rural Remote"" which is where they live more than 25 miles from a significant town of 2500 or more.

&gt; Where I live, an SDC service would have to be 1/5 of what Uber costs before it even starts to be competitive with a moderately-priced private vehicle.

Again, not sure about Canada but are you saying that Uber costs $0.55 x 5 or $2.75/mile?  Where I am in Atlanta it's about $2/mile and I get told all the time that I'm crazy and Uber is only $1/mile by others on this forum.

There is still a lot of debate on how much an SDC would cost, but there is plenty of good arguments that it would cost significantly less than private vehicle.  There are lots of reasons, but the main point is that EVs are able to have a life cycle of 1m miles which is more than a private individual could ever possibly make use of.  By using all 1m miles, the cost per mile would be substantially lower than anything that could be achieved by individuals.


&gt; And a lot of people will pay a little more if they don't have to wait and don't have to ride in a shared vehicle.

Even private rides would be less than owning your own car.  It would also be much more convenient than dealing with parking and walking once you reach your destination. At scale, wait times should be minimal for most pickups.  The longest wait would be from your house where you can relax in comfort for the few minutes it takes the vehicle to arrive assuming you don't just have it scheduled to always be there at 7:30am every day waiting for you.",1569985970,f25wxcg,t1_f25hbsq,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

As for the atmospheric scattering, what is really happening at 1550nm vs 905nm is more energy absorption, not scattering. Scattering is worse at 905nm than 1550nm as the shorter the wavelength of light, the smaller the particle size is needed to scatter it and generally, the smaller the particle, the more numerous they are. Talking about water effects without also discussing scattering is again showing somewhat of a bias.

As for the testing, I don't think that it will be possible to get away from a test at some level. Lasers are fickle beasts, I would be very surprised if there is not 100% testing of output energy and beam quality already in place somewhere, adding a pump leakage test to this shouldn't be too difficult, and honestly I don't see how you would be able to get FDA approval without it.",1569948006,f24apox,t1_f23z9kp,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

86,NoelRA,"As far as I concern, at the aperture the beam size of the lasers is less than the 7mm (hence all the energy is inside the cornea). You can increase the ""aperture of your eye"" at, for example,  10m, but you will not absorb much power than the power of the laser. Your point (which is taken into account when you classify a laser product) would have a sense if the beam size is higher than the eye pupil (and I think that is not the case in any LiDAR).

The problem with 1550nm is that the energy of the pulses is integrated during 10s. If the LiDAR designers limit the power of the laser taking into account that there is only one LiDAR (and this is what they do), then two 1550nm LiDARS in your field of view will be dangerous. You are integrating during this 10s the energy of different LiDARs in your cornea.

This is why 1550nm has a high risk to be a bad choice for markets like automotive. Surprisingly, the article doesn't speak about that.",1569941862,f240568,t1_f23mtrs,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw
87,WeldAE,"&gt; Anyone who thought that 1550 was a cure all and you could do whatever you wanted has a severe misunderstanding of how these things work.

Are you saying the article wasn't needed and doesn't raise valid points that those that use Lidar were already aware of?


&gt; Atmospheric transmission is an entirely different discussion and talking about water absorption without discussing particle scattering is disingenuous.

I'm unclear who you are refering to as disingenuous.  The article seems to talk about scattering or is there something they are conflating that I don't understand?

&gt; &gt; Velodyne adds that 1550-nm lidars may require higher power for a given range because the longer wavelength suffers more scattering from atmospheric moisture .

&gt; it's a simple test to measure the output, and should be regulated and tested on every device.

That would significantly raise the price of a Lidar unit.  We do 100% QA on our non-lidar electronics when we first start receiving a new factory run.  This is a very simple QA test of does it turn on and it runs through a 15s diagnostic test and dumps the results over WiFi and turns off.  So you just need to pull the unit out of the box, hit the on button and move one.  Once you've done this for ~50 units you go back to the first one and pack it back up.  

This is massively expensive for us.  It isn't so much about the test but the handling of the units. We have to have roughly 2x the warehouse space to keep the units separate and have room to test.  More than that it's all the labor in the handling of the units.  Unpacking and repacking pallets of units.  Opening the boxes and pulling the unit out and putting it back.

90,Z1gg0,"What a username. Maybe an agenda?

Anyone who thought that 1550 was a cure all and you could do whatever you wanted has a severe misunderstanding of how these things work. At 905 the lens focuses the light onto the retnia causing damage at relatively low pulse energy levels. At 1550 there is no focusing and the energy is absorbed by the eyes, but a high enough energy level will burn the cornia. This energy level is significantly higher than the energy level it takes to burn a retnia at 905. Atmospheric transmission is an entirely different discussion and talking about water absorbtion without discussing particle scattering is disingenuous. Allowing pump light to leak out of a 1550nm system is just lazy, there will always be some small amount, no beamsplitter coating is perfect, but it should never be anywhere close to eye damaging levels. That's not to say that some idiot manufacturer might not screw it up, but the FDA regulates these things, it's a simple test to measure the output, and should be regulated and tested on every device. 

The fact (physics) of the matter is that a 1550nm system will operate at a longer range than a 905nm system when both are eyesafe at the aperture.

The real issue with either is what happens with either when any sort of optics is between the eyeball/sensor and the lidar transmitter. Binoculars, or any other device that increases the effective aperture of the eyeball/sensor will decrease the eyesafe range, so while it still is ""eyesafe at the aperture"" it can cause still cause damage. That is the real safety argument against lidar.",1569931524,f23mtrs,t3_dbor00,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

* The NHTSA states that 17250 car accidents are reported per day. [source](https://amaresq.com/blog/auto-accidents/how-many-car-accidents-per-day/)

* Of those accidents, approximately 1 in 5 happen in parking lots. [source](https://www.myparkingsign.com/blog/parking-lot-accidents/) which means there are 3450 parking lot accidents *each day* in the US.

* There are 268.8 million cars in the US. [source](https://www.quora.com/How-many-cars-are-there-in-the-US)

* Of those cars, 250,000 are Teslas. [source](https://www.statista.com/topics/2086/tesla/), which we'll call roughly 0.1% of all US cars.

So we should be able to extrapolate that 3 and a half teslas are involved in an accident in the US each day in a parking lot. Furthermore, I'd wager about 10 to 50% of tesla owners are actually using smart summon. So that 3.5 number drops to .3-1.5 accidents a day using smart summon.

As for EV depreciation, obviously their longevity is much better than a modern ICE equivalent (hell, I wouldn't trust most modern BMWs or Audis to hit 500k KM, let alone the million KM mark that used be the benchmark for German cars). But still, Teslas with as little as 80k KM can be found for under 40k EUR on [mobile.de](https://mobile.de). That's half price off and it's actually a rare car in the EU.Once EVs become more commonplace, they will depreciate faster, even if not nearly as fast as a petrol car.

Then again, I'd be more willing to spend 35k EUR on a 6 year old Tesla Model S than 25k EUR on a 6 year old S-Class (the latter being more luxurious, but definitely less reliable), so if that's how SDC EVs will depreciate, there'll still be a decent used market for them.",1569870514,f21caot,t1_f21a137,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

120,WeldAE,"&gt; It won't catch on.

You then proceed to support this statement by talking about at best 5% of the population.

&gt; For instance how are you going to do a self driving car to go out in the fields for one reason or another.

I grew up in a ""Rural - Remote"" area as defined by the census and I only ever drove in a field 1 time and that was joy riding after a big rain.  For those that actually need to drive in fields there will be work vehicles that can do it.

&gt; or when I go fishing and bring back fish bait and am dirty from the trip.

I don't see why this is an issue.  Bait smells but not that bad and I've never been so dirty from fishing I can ride in a car without issue.  Now after a deer hunting trip that could be an issue.  Again though you are talking about a very very small percentage of the population and they could just keep a manual truck for things like this.  I could even see a special ride option for this with a surcharge for a clean after your trip.

&gt;  It'll be fine for people in the city but people who live 20 miles from Anything it won't be a valid thing.

This is such a vanishingly small number of people.  20% of the population is considered ""Rural"" or any sort but the census breaks that population down even further into these three groups.  ""Rural - Remote"" is 1.7% of the population of the US.  You have to be more than 10 miles from a town of 2,500 people and more than 25 miles from a urban area of more than 50k people.  Even places you think are rural aren't really that remote.

* Rural - Fringe (41): Census-defined rural territory that is less than or equal to 5 miles from an Urbanized Area, as well as rural territory that is less than or equal to 2.5 miles from an Urban Cluster.
* Rural - Distant (42): Census-defined rural territory that is more than 5 miles but less than or equal to 25 miles from an Urbanized Area, as well as rural territory that is more than 2.5 miles but less than or equal to 10 miles from an Urban Cluster.

Depends on how many cars are on the road. The probability to have a fatal accident is a function of speed, and average driven speed depends on traffic density.

The industry likes to claim that this is a consequence of advances in security design, but the role of that factor can be diminished.

&gt;	On a more serious note though, this is definitely a great use case. I park in a gigantic parking lot at work (we're pretty high up on a list of biggest buildings in the US, so you can imagine the parking issues), and if I forget where I park, it could be 20 minutes of wandering around trying to find the car. Last week I parked in an area I don't usually park due to going out for lunch and coming back later than most of the lunch crowd, and I probably spent an extra 10 minutes going up and down rows of cars. Event at 2 MPH this would be amazing to have.

160,IAmDanimal,"Okay cool, so you've found a hole in one of the multiple use cases I described above. But you could still use it if the parking lot is otherwise empty, and generally there aren't babies in my work parking lot because it's a parking lot for a huge company that requires a badge to get into the gated office complex and there's no day care, so probably not too many babies to run over. I also leave work a lot earlier than the majority of people there, so there are rarely more than a couple other people around.

And sure, maybe in other cases there's a chance there could be a baby around. But why is the baby just laying on the ground in a parking lot? Who puts their baby on the ground in a parking lot? And even if they did do that, autopilot at this point is getting pretty good at avoiding obstacles, so there's a pretty low chance it would hit a human, especially when it's going 5 mph at most.

But what about the rain? Or people that have health issues that prevent them from easily getting to their car or getting into their car? What about waiting with heavy items to load into your car that you don't want to just leave on the curb? What about the other use cases I haven't even thought of off the top of my head (like the one about health issues, which was brought up by another poster here)? Why try to downplay the feature's usefulness by saying one scenario may not be a great idea right now, when there are clearly a bunch of other use cases for it?",1569814895,f1yeqhg,t1_f1twhx6,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

&gt; Tesla, Waymo Projected To Lead In Autonomous Vehicles

&gt; The Morgan Stanley analyst said he expects Tesla Motors (TSLA) and Waymo to be market leaders in autonomous vehicles in **2030. He expects Tesla to have 26% share, with Waymo next at 18%.**

&gt; **General Motors (GM) would be third in market share, at 13%, with Uber Technologies (UBER) ranked No. 4 at 6%, according to Novak's market forecast.**

The absurdity of this gets even worse when you apply Waymo's valuation to Tesla. If Tesla will control 8% more of the market then Waymo then Tesla should be worth at least $105 billion according to this analyst.

This means that Tesla is absurdly undervalued at $44 billion today according to this analyst, so naturally if you trust Morgan Stanley you should be buying shares of Tesla all day long right? Nope, Morgan Stanley slashed their Tesla price target to just $220 a share a few months ago, putting them at a valuation below their current $44 billion market share, and they still maintain a neutral buy rating on them. So I guess that means that Morgan Stanley believes the rest of Tesla's business is somehow worth negative $60 billion dollars.",1569705052,f1qqo5i,t1_f1o5guo,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

&gt; *Available now on GitHub to facilitate the creation of groundbreaking autonomous driving innovations*

&gt; Taipei, Taiwan, September 25, 2019 – VIA Technologies, Inc. today announced the availability of VIA-AI source code and documentation on GitHub for the global developer community. The VIA-AI app enables the addition of level 2 driver assistance capabilities by connecting an Android smartphone to the CAN (Control Area Network) bus of a vehicle.

&gt; “Our mission with VIA-AI is to facilitate the development of driver assistance applications by making our technologies accessible to everyone,” commented Richard Brown, Vice-President of International Marketing, VIA Technologies, Inc. “We look forward to working with developers, enthusiasts, and industry partners to accelerate the creation of groundbreaking autonomous driving innovations.”

&gt; **The VIA-AI Driver Assistance App**

&gt; VIA-AI is an open source driver assistance app that supports Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS), and CAN Bus integration functions. It enables the development of driver assistance capabilities for selected vehicles using a modern Android smartphone and hardware connectors.

&gt; VIA-AI is compatible with current generation flagship Android devices, and verified for full functionality with HTC U11 and HTC U12+, and Google Pixel2 smartphones; other smartphone models are currently under evaluation. The VIA-AI app connects to the vehicle’s CAN Bus using a standard onboard diagnostics port (OBD-II) and a giraffe connector (available from comma.ai). Once installed, the VIA-AI app connects to the vehicle’s subsystem to manipulate acceleration, brake and steering functions, providing Level 2 driver assistance on the highway.

&gt; Learn more about the VIA-AI platform here: http://viaai.com/

&gt; VIA-AI source code, documentation and support is available here: https://github.com/via-intelligent-vision/VIA-AI

&gt; Watch a short video of the VIA-AI driver assistance app in action here: https://youtu.be/NAkFJRXgz5s

420,quazimootoo,"CNBC:

Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car division, is taking longer than expected to develop a commercialized product, leading analysts at Morgan Stanley to lower their valuation of the company by 40%.

In a report on Thursday, Morgan Stanley cut its valuation on Waymo to $105 billion from $175 billion, based a discounted cash flow analysis.

""Over the past year, there have been a series of hurdles relating to the commercialization and advancement of autonomous driving technology,"" the analysts wrote. ""Most notably, we underestimated how long safety drivers are likely to be present within cars and the timing of the rollout of autonomous rides-sharing services.""

Waymo, formerly Google's self-driving car project, has made aggressive strides of late, receiving regulatory approvals, improving driving systems and partnering with other auto manufacturers. However, CNBC reported in August that Waymo's self-driving car efforts still rely heavily on human elements, including having safety drivers present in rides.

Morgan Stanley said the biggest factors in lowering its valuation are that the overall industry is developing more slowly than anticipated and that losses in ridesharing will continue mounting, largely because of the continuing need for safety drivers.

In terms of Alphabet's current value, Morgan Stanley has a price target of $1,450, which implies a market cap of about $1 trillion. That assessment values Waymo at about $20 billion, ""given industry uncertainty and investors' lower willingness to pay for cash-burning entities.""",1569619724,f1nl5ix,t3_da6te9,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

494,notgalgon,"Hardware was an issue early on in that they had to build most of it from scratch.  However, once the first couple of generations of lidar were completed SDCs became 99.9% a software problem.  Yes to be a viable company the costs for equipment needed to continue to decrease but the software problem was never fully solved.  We actually do not know that it can be solved without some amazing breakthrough in AI.  

We have proven that we can create sensors, lidar and cameras that should provide a self driving car more than enough information that it can drive itself.  We have not proven that we are capable of creating the software that is robust enough to handle all the possible situations that a human driver can - and do so safely.   Once we have this software the replication of it is easy, then it becomes how to make the SDC as cost effective as possible.  

Obviously companies like waymo are doing both at the same time but even if the first gen SDC cost 300k there would be a market for it.  

On your auto industry comment - my guess is waymo said you guys make the cars and we will provide the software and manage all of that.  However, this would eventually turn the car companies into a commodity manufacturer.   The future growth in the car market is owning the SDC platform, selling ads to the users, collecting data about everything, and making money on the trips.  All of the manufacturers want a piece of this new cash flow so they are trying to do SDC on their own.

Sure, I agree with that. But how is this relevant to owned SDC vs. rental SDC? I'm just saying that owning one is cheaper long-term than renting. 

&gt;You pay a fraction of all that. 

A proportional fraction, so it's exactly the same in the long term. 

&gt;If you know that in 10 years it would be worth a fraction of what you pay now, whould you buy it?

Sure, just like I bought a car instead of using those short-term rentals.

You keep missing the point that you can do other things while commuting, even if it's just relaxing. . Driving is taxing. Especially in traffic and NY has a lot of that. And if you remove driving, than you have to remove the cost from the driver for the taxi service...

  


&gt;Taxis have to pay all of that too, you know. Gas costs the same whether you're using your car or a taxi, 15 miles is 15 miles. Commercial insurance for taxis costs WAY more because they're on the road all the time, so they have higher chances of being in an accident. Maintenance bills are proportional to mileage, taxis have to get their oil changed every month or two.

You pay a fraction of all that. The additional costs is spread across a lot more customers based on utilization rates. Also in the case of the taxi these are business expenses, so they are tax deductible. The taxi drivier is working and making money, you as an owner of the vehicle are spending your after tax dollars to be impaled from making money.

&gt;I guess it's similar to owning/renting a house? Sure, renting is great if you move from city to city every few months, but it's not great if you can stick to the same house for a decade.

509,Cmacu,"In fact a lot of people living in big cities do use taxies (Uber) for every day commute, because it's cheaper than owning a car. In fact when I was leaving in New York, I left my car in Maryland, because it was cheaper and faster for me to use Uber for transportation. Recently when I moved to Dallas, I was considering doing the same and the only reason I didn't is because I own the car. Next year I am moving to California and I've already decided on selling the car, so I am able to work while commuting. Owning a car is already more expensive than taxies for a lot of people, many just don't realize it yet, because they don't account for additional cost like insurance, gas, maintenance, parking, tolls, registration taxes, etc. Add to that the money you can make while you are not driving (in my case 3 digits an hour) and you will quickly see the difference.

It still seems to me that having the tool, such as lidar, would make it easier to find an approach to solving the issue that is likely to work. I totally understand the issue of data sets that don't add meaningful data, but adding high res 3 dimensional data seems very unlikely to not be valuable. I'd argue that if cost and form weren't a factor at all, it would likely be easier to build a successful self driving system off pure lidar data compared to pure video in the visual spectrum, at least in the initial landmarks of progression in capacity.

I think it's possible to do both, or a combined approach, but I'm sympathetic to musks strategy of solving the system with cheap equipment. The systems that use Lidar are likely not going to have the same impact, because there just won't be that many of them. Maybe Tesla won't manage snowy conditions, but who cares, honestly?

515,TheOsuConspiracy,"I'm not saying either of your are right or wrong, there are some valid points on both sides, *but* it really seems like you guys are debating something you don't really have much understanding of.

For example:

&gt; I don't really follow the condescending snark. What about driving makes it impossible for a computer system to accomplish what a biological system can, given the same inputs?

NNs are *very* loosely based off human neurons, but really, you can't say that just because a human can learn something sufficiently off X inputs that a NN can learn just as well off those inputs.

But he's also right that adding another sources of data doesn't necessarily improve ability to learn. In this case, I'm pretty sure it would help, but it's not true in general. If that data is largely redundant or low snr, it could reduce the ability of the NN to generalize.

&gt; My understanding of neural nets is that they compile a variety of metrics, and apply statistical values to those metrics and depending on the overall weighting of the metrics, it's making decisions.

Kinda, they train via backpropagation which is essentially minimization of a loss function via some sort of gradient descent.

&gt; Thus having data like the entire unobstructed octagon, the letters, the border, the colors, the height relative to the ground and the orientation of close to head on, are all going to make the NN more likely to be accurate, or easier/more rapid to become accurate, and when you take away that data, such as a stop sign with a bush in front of it, or a stop sign that is full of shot holes, is going to introduce uncertainty into a NN.

That really depends on your NN/self-driving architecture. Tesla uses a more end to end model, which means that there's no guarantee that their model even understands any of the above in a way that a human would. They map low level data (raw video pixels) into their model which could have nearly any internal representation. We do know they have some concept of other cars, lanes, etc. But whether they are using high level features like what you suggested is quite unlikely.

Waymo's approach is more like that, assembling a few nets that take in low level representations and provide higher level features that are an input into their driving system.

Tesla's approach makes it so that they're much more likely to see regressions in their self-driving performance, but is easier to build, and scales better with data. Whereas Waymo's approach ensures their can improve their subsystems in a vacuum, which should likely result in a monotonically improving self-driving system.",1569519468,f1j6s67,t1_f1j1nrb,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

All cars now require a human driver and insurance isn't all that big since every car owner can afford it. I see no reason why it would increase. What I can see is that insurance for ""safer"" self-driving cars will be cheaper.

526,Cmacu,"Oh, now I understand where your confusion comes from. You think the value of full self-driving car (no driver involved) and (almost) self driving car (driver required) as the same or similar.
Well, the difference between the value is so big, I don't even know where to start. Here are a few points:
- The only way full self-driving cars (no driver involved) are possible is if they are safer then human. And when they are safer than human, you will start seeing regulations restricting first the selling of non full self-driving cars and then probably driving them all together. This will take time, but it's inevitable. Why? Many reasons, but even just because of the value of human lives. So I would even question the possibility to buy one.
- The insurance difference between insuring full self driving car and one that has to be monitored by human driver will be so big, that it's going to make the price of the car itself irrelevant.
- The time is the most valuable thing, non having to drive/monitor the car enables you to do other things that create greater value than the value of owning a (almost) self driving car. 
- Ones full self driving technology (no driver involved) is available, it would be a trivial task to convert newly manufactured vehicles to that technology, regardless of what's needed (hardware or software). And the demand for producing full self driving cars (no driver involved) will be so much, that there will be little room to selling them without this technology (even at much higher cost)
- the cost of renting fully self driving car will be comparable to owning an (almost) self driving one (it already is even when you add the labor cost). Adding the fact that owning is upfront cost, you are locked on your choice, the uncertainty, that it would last, the value created by saving time for not having to drive yourself, the higher risks of getting injured or dying and the increased cost of owning the vehicle (purchase price, insurance), this is not even comparable.

595,Cmacu,"Wow, if you think that any manufacturer or business in general does anything just because the consumers want it, than we just have a different understanding about business and how it functions. My question remains, why would they sell it, if they can own it and make more money with it? The only reason I can see is because the price is comparable to what they can make by renting it.

Let's do a back of the napkin simple math: let's say that the car design life is 10 years. By renting it only half of the time you can make 1800 days x 24 hours = 43 200 hours by $1.00 (to make this simple we will keep it the same: reveniew for the business, cost for the consumer. The bigger this number is, the higher the gap would be) = $43 200. So to buy this car you have to pay at least $35k. If you instead rent on average 2 hours a day, this is 3650 days by 2 hours by $1.00 = $7300. $35k upfront vs $7k over 10 years, I don't know about a consumer who would take this deal.

Adding charging, maintenance, risk, insurance, etc is only making it worse, because the cost for these would always be higher for the consumer. In the end of the 10 years the value as an asset is about the same, because of technology advances.

If you switch the math to mileage instead of time, it's even worse.

Unless you are hopping that the manufacturer would sell you this car for $7k this would never work. And 7k is still a very bad deal, because of its upfront and there are also maintenance, insurance costs, etc. Also you are stuck out with your choose, renting gives you options. On top of that more than likely your $1.00 cost would reduce (ride sharing, bulk deals, promotions, competition).

Maybe you are thinking that you can rent it back to compensate, but the question than is: do you still own it.. also I am not sure assuming all the costs and risks to compete with the big businesses is actually worth it.

And if you want to just ignore all that and buy that car, well I am sure there would be a way you can do that. Although I am not sure you would be able to afford it.",1569451268,f1frgot,t1_f1fiigo,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

Your assumption is that the manufacturer would sell it at cost, but that's not how economy works. The only reason I can see to sell direct to consumer is, if the sale price is comparable to the money they can make by renting it (your cost). So to buy it at reasonable price you should be able to utilize it as much as a shared vehicle. Which is technically impossible. And that's why you would not be able to own the car, unless you are so rich that the price doesn't matter.

The long term ownership doesn't matter, because at this point the life of the vehicle is measured only by the mileage or time it's used, depending on the rental model and not by the years you own it. In fact the longer you own it without utilizing it the more expensive it is, because renting the same vechicle would just make more money over the same amounts of time.

The biggest cost of using your own car is fuel. This cost will become virtually non-existent once electric cars take off, and then there won't be any oil changes, spark plugs and all that. Brakes will last longer too because of regen. Ownership will become way more affordable than it is today, and with more and more sophisticated safety and crash avoidance systems insurance will become cheaper too.

Given the number of people who currently drive for Uber, I don't think it's at all difficult to imagine people would commit their car's downtime to it without having to spend the time on it themselves.

727,WeldAE,"&gt; Has anything really changed since then?

According to Waymo One riders, the car has gotten a lot better.  This is all 3rd party information but it seems pretty credible and there is no reason to think they've made no progress at all as you suggest.  Even if they aren't good enough to go full driverless, logic says they have made progress.

&gt; If you see the video, it took a very long time to change lanes. The average driver in Phoenix would have changed lanes a lot sooner than that.

I'm not saying it wasn't, I'm simply restating what the reporter that followed Waymo cars around stated which is that he had to guess to some degree when it was being controlled by the driver and when it wasn't.  They certainly had issues with left turns and merging in the past and they may still have issues.

&gt; It looks like Google is planning to sell Waymo to hapless investors - why else does it put out a video every year instead of actually removing the drivers.

There is being skeptical and there is being paranoid.  There is absolutely nothing to suggest that this is Waymo's plan.  They are not making progress as fast as anyone wants, but everything suggests that they are working to field a viable SDC fleet.  I have way more issues with their platform of choice than I do their progress on the driving AI as far as having a viable fleet at some point.

742,DavidT953,"Great comments! Automotive should learn a lot form aviation.

Some personal opinions about some of the questions:

Radars in automotive are not what they are in aviation. They are made to be cheap and simple to integrate, so their capabilities more basic. As well, it is harder to process Radar data in a road due to the multitude of objects and noise. It should be said that the technology is evolving fast towards more precise imaging Radars, but we are not there yet.

There is a good idea mentioned in the post, that perhaps should be explored in automotive: ADS-B-like and automatic deconfliction. Perhaps automotive should adopt something similar. Although the problem is much harder since the required accuracy and latency are harder than in aviation. [V2V technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_communication_systems) aims to do this but there is little standardization nor serious progress in the industry.

834,Anonymicex,"I work in the field, and not to sound negative, but this is one area that has barely been explored. Most accidents involving autonomous vehicles (AVs) have been settled out of court, meaning there are rarely, if any, court cases involving autonomous vehicle injury and death that go to trial. There are some related to Tesla, but that's a level two system which means the driver is still responsible for all vehicular functions and I doubt any judge or lawyer could prove Tesla is at fault or has negligence. 

&gt; Any information about relevant legislation adopted by States or the Federal government of the US would be very helpful. 

Unfortunately, the federal government is lax in the US when it comes to self-driving cars. As of now, each state can write their own rules/laws concerning AV testing in their respective states. For example, California has one of the strictest laws in the country such as requiring drivers to possess an Autonomous Test Vehicle permit given by the DMV after passing internal tests, passing internal defensive driving courses, etc., whereas states like Michigan have none. Though the federal government can implement guidelines through the National Transportation and Highway Safety Administration (NTHSA), most states pick and choose what they feel will best help their economy regarding lax regulations to bring business into their states. I hope that helps, although I know your question was more related to insurance and liability.

The fact that they are looking for a full time engineer to perform all these tasks implies (to me) that their system is still very immature (which is fine if they are just ramping up, but a warning sign if they've been at it for a more than 3-4 years, and have more than 2-3 test trucks).",1569189588,f15flzb,t1_f15c5yi,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

There are software developers who make $300 per hour, but very few. That comes out to $600,000 per year.  The vast majority of Silicon Valley developers make less than $200k per year.   Plus.  The idea of having 75,000 developers is overkill.  The teams are much smaller than this.  Waymo has fewer than 1000 developers on their team.  Why would they increase their labor force 75 fold AFTER they have made all this progress?  It seems to me that once the progress is mostly finished that the team won't need to expand.  Likewise, will definitely not expand 100 fold to a bunch of $600,000 per year laborers.  There will be technicians who service the cars but they are $50,000-$60,000 labor, not $600,000.   The labor is going to be less than 1/3rd of your estimate cost per hour and there will probably only be 1/50th of the labor you figured.  Your assumptions are off and therefore your arithmetic is also off.  


Uber loses money because they take their earnings per ride and re-invest them.  Apple and Amazon were both losing money during the early 2000s doing this same thing.  Apple was losing money by spending their earnings on the iPhone.  Amazon was losing money spending their earnings on scale.   Tesla is the same way, they are spending billions of dollars constructing the gigafactories and people think they just lose money on every car they sell not seeing that they are spending all of their earnings on massive growth in the near future.",1569090679,f0zaqm8,t1_f0z9ak0,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

875,bladerskb,"There is a reason why there's a huge gap in ADAS quality/features yet almost all automakers are using the same chip because the EyeQ chips are being used by different companies. Look at the fact that the 2016 Supercruise and AP1 was still the best ADAS system until propilot 2 came along and that's system using 2013 tech.

Some companies use the chip to provide ping pong lane keeping or to only provide AEB or lane depature warning. Does that mean EyeQ3 and EyeQ4 is only capable of lane departure warning?

&gt;  I mean there are features (traffic lights) in the pipeline for OEM ADAS systems right now

Yeah and they will be using a 2017 Q4 EyeQ4 neural network. Just like BMW's ACC traffic light recognition.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_ekVsEG64c

That is using the same EyeQ4 and they said they will release the feature with an OTA update.

If the problem was the chips then they would need the new EyeQ5 for the traffic light. But the delay we see from implementation is from the complacency and incompetency of automakers.

Take for example propilot 2.0 is the first on-ramp to off-ramp other than tesla and yet it too is only using the same old  EyeQ4. How come everyone else doesn't have on-rap to off-ramp?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqwjKDLgQzY

Take for example seeing cars on dashboard. This has always been available to automakers since EyeQ3 and Tesla put it to use and display cars around the car in AP1. Yet no automaker followed suit. Now they are finally starting to do it.

BMW assisted driving view and the propilot 2 are first system other than AP. They both use EyeQ4 and this is almost 4 years after Tesla did it with EyeQ3.

Taking this position is grossly misrepresenting what FCW and AEB actually do. They are driver assist not driver replacements. You're trying to gauge their effectiveness from data that doesn't even represent what the system was designed for. You can further look at the CAN data and determine how much the driver applied brakes vs how much was commanded by the AEB and learn more about what actually happened in each event and if the driver wasn't actually braking enough or quickly enough. Obviously it will always be a case by case basis. However, the idea that you can't determine effectiveness from this is blind to the actual data available.

The reported or observed crash rates, *especially on highways and divided roads*, is far lower than 194 per million miles. Chances are that all but (at most) a tiny few would have been handled by the driver without any assistance or warning.

Events where the driver didn’t intervene include false positives(because the driver saw no reason to hit the brakes). Most AEB events are assisted braking and also alert the driver with audible and visual FCW cues. So you’re not even looking at the data correctly if you’re trying to pick when AEB brakes for someone who had no idea they were about to be in a forward collision. 

People should be hitting the brakes during AEB events. Either the AEB engaged and the driver applied brakes after or the driver wasn’t braking hard enough and AEB added additional braking force. I don’t know what situation you think humans wouldn’t brake but AEB would. Maybe if they were asleep? That sounds like a very specific representation of the data.

Their dataset has just 14 AEB events where the driver did not intervene. Out of these, 10 are clear false positives, and 4 that might have prevented a crash, but they did not verify it actually did.

That is 4 potential true positives vs 10 clear false positives. A false positive could also be very dangerous - aggressively braking in the middle of a highway can easily result in being rear-ended.

So as always, we have a tradeoff. What we need to know is what are the costs and benefits of each AEB system, and whether the benefits outweigh the cost.

It's very close to the 4.33 you were citing, and my guess is that it's due to increases in efficiency on average since the 4.33 number was generated.

Admittedly I didn't dig into the data enough to find if this is averaged over total of installed panel capacity, which would be more concentrated in high insolation locations. It could also be averaged evenly across land area. 

This is also generated value, not insolation intensity. This is about 75% generation compared to nominal capacity times insolation average, which is a pretty fair distortion from a variety of issues with losses related to inversion, maximum power point potential, storage, resistance, dusty surfaces, trees shading cells etc. 

If large amounts of solar were installed in high insolation areas recently, it could easily account for the tiny increase in efficiency between your figure and the one I found recently, or the same data being averaged slightly differently.

I think you are ignoring a lot of the aspects of your own analogy.  You can buy a server outright and run it out of your house.  However, to match the actual service you get out of a cloud setup you would have to buy a lot more things like higher speed Internet, backup solutions, redundant power systems, etc.  What you spend would be a lot more than it would cost you just for using the cloud.  Now as you need more computers you can spread the extra over more computers and you start to be able to save money over the cloud.

Here ""more computers"" is the same as more miles driven.  If you own an EV, you would need to drive 66k miles per year to compete with the cost of a fleet service.  Even then this means for most of the time you will be driving around in a 6-15 year old car while everyone else is being driven by vehicles under 6 years of age.  You also will pay more for maintenance, parking, etc.

I have an EV and if I drive it 30k/year for 10 years it will have cost me around $0.20/mile to drive.  The same car in a fleet will cost less than $0.10/mile, be newer and you never have to maintain, wash or park it.",1569006620,f0wfxqs,t1_f0wcfl4,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

Just look at how long it has taken them to deliver on Enhanced Summon, and when it will be delivered in the new few weeks, it will still be in a janky state where it can’t do basic things like stay to the right or obey traffic signs in the parking lot.  City driving is going to be way way more difficult than that.

I’m pretty certain that they’re at least five years away from FSD, which would give plenty of time for LIDAR to get cheaper.

&gt;	But even if they did, there is still a massive challenge of using the input from 4+ LIDAR sensors (plus radar, video, etc) and creating a SDC from it.

Waymo has been working on that problem way longer than Tesla has.  They’ve been working with more expensive LIDAR, sure, but they’ve also been working on making the LIDAR cheaper, and once cheaper LIDAR is out, they won’t have to start from scratch to adapt to it.

&gt;	Even if they did manage, all of that SW and ML doesn't come for free. That's really THE business case for Waymo. They don't want to be in the HW business, they will license out the stack that is capable of self driving. How much per unit do you think they would need to charge to earn money?

It does takes curves way better than stock, but Open Pilot still only works with the torque limits set by manufacturer for safety and probably liability reasons. It my experience, OP on the civic can make most curves on the highway if you drive at the legal speed limit.  It does get iffier the faster you go though. OP alerts you when it thinks it can't make a curve so you could intervene. A recent update automatically slows down the car before the bigger curves, so it does help out quite a bit.

The ACC is also is better because it automatically resumes when you come to a complete stop even after 3 seconds (I believe stock forces you to press a button or gas after 3 seconds). It also resumes in a smooth manner manner unlike stock.  What sucks though is it doesn't let you select the distance behind the car anymore, and it defaults at the max distance I think.   Also, OP only affects ACC if it has a nidec radar hardware. If it has Bosch, it uses the stock ACC. I know 2019 uses Bosch, not nidec. I'm not 100% sure about 2018 though.

No sure what this has to do with a reporter using a loaner car Vs a fleet car.  You can simply watch the saftey driver, if there is one, and see if they override the car.

&gt; People have always said ""you can get the driverless car to go around the block a couple of times instead of looking for a parking spot"".

You could, but this isn't how Waymo works.  The car doesn't wait on you it finds another ride or positions itself at a specific locations around the area to wait for another ride.  They would have to change the code to tie the one car to one person and it may result in long waits even if there is an empty Waymo nearby because you can only ride in one specific car.

&gt; The problem with driverless cars is not that it takes time to get from the depot to the house

If they are going from the depot to the house it is going to take forever.  How and where they stage cars around the service area is a huge part of the effort of building a fleet service.  This isn't to minimize the driving part or even compare the complexity, but they are both serious challenges and if they don't get them both correct, it will not be successful.

12,WeldAE,"&gt; My number just came from googling ""how long does it take to charge a tesla"" and glancing at the top result. 

Yeah, charging isn't as simple as a single number and I hope I conveyed that in my reply.  In the end you probably gave a good estimate of the time required, even if not for exactly the correct reasons once you factored drive time and slow charging on purpose to protect the battery.  I would never recommend anyone get an EV if they couldn't charge at home reasonably.  It's the best part of owning an EV after the cost savings; always having a full ""tank"" and never having to stop at gas stations.

&gt; It will probably happen eventually...

The car makers road maps are pretty open about what is coming.  The only question is can they produce a good car at a good price.  Battery cost is still a real problem to get it below $30k which is where your average car is.  VW says they will do it but we have to wait and see the car.

&gt; ..making it a constant war for a spot.

Yeah, that would be no good.  The good news is that the chargers themselves are cheap, it's running the line to them that is expensive.  They also don't take up any parking room so no parking lost.  Hopefully when they put them in they run the power in such a way that they can add chargers later as demand calls for it.

&gt; There are a lot of different companies working on self-driving technology with a lot of different philosophies. 

True, but I think Tesla is the only one planning on selling cars in the near future.  The rest on the list are the ones that have no chance of doing FSD so they are aiming for L2.  Tesla seriously out classes these companies from the engineering side and I really don't hold out much hope for Nissian, VW, Honda, Ford, Merc, BMW, Kia, etc to ever get self driving done in the next decade.  The ones that can like Waymo, Apple and GM are probably not going to sell independent cars since they are aiming for L4 fleet style setups which is easier than L4 personal cars.

&gt; if you're talking future-proofing at this point we're all jumping in before the legislative issues

As far as 'even the top industry experts agree that...' it's rough getting into computer vision and deep reinforcement learning without a strong background in mathematics already, but it's open to anyone wanting to jump in. I haven't screwed around with any self driving stuff yet personally, but it'd be a really interesting area to jump into at some point. I think one of the huge hurdles to go over in machine learning in general right now is in representation learning... how do you compartmentalize the world to get traction on hard problems? There's some crazy advances that've come in the last few years, and I wouldn't be surprised if a holy grail breakthrough eventually comes from the self driving car arena specifically, the problems are certainly large enough to warrant novel approaches.

Of course that is an hour total with the drive time. The other problem is that it's not good to super charge your car that much so maybe your factoring in slowing the charge down on purpose to protect the battery?

No. My number just came from googling ""how long does it take to charge a tesla"" and glancing at the top result. 

&gt; Every year this becomes much more likely to happen. EVs are going to be a significant percentage of the cars in the next few years. The other option is you could move to somewhere that lets you charge if you didn't want to wait.

It will probably happen eventually, and an electric car would be my preference if there was a decent charging option. I just hope they do it right if they do it. 

I could see them just putting in a few first come/first serve spots and then a lot more people buying electric cars than there are spots to serve them, making it a constant war for a spot.

&gt; Again, don't hold your breath for anyone else other than Tesla and don't hold your breath for Tesla getting cheaper. It's possible the tax credits could change making it cheaper.

I think that's too pessimistic. There are a lot of different companies working on self-driving technology with a lot of different philosophies. 

I'd expect cars that can match Tesla's self-driving capabilities while being sold at a lower price in a couple of years, but my car is only seven years old and still under 40k miles, so I can probably wait another five or so if it takes that long. 

Besides, if you're talking future-proofing at this point we're all jumping in before the legislative issues have even been addressed, so it's all gamble.

No it does not. Ultrasonics in AP1 and in AP2 sucked. when Lane changes were based on Ultrasonics the success rate was closer to 50%. Ultrasonics don't work in high speed because of the wind and they have ridiculous low range (less than 20 ft) and a whole lot of false positive and false negative because of that.

Not in any meaninful way. They will tell you how many average miles between emergency disengagements by the safety drivers, but not what type of roads they were on, nor how many continuous miles they have gone without an urgent disengagement.

What has been left completely unreported is how long they can drive continuously without a safety driver taking over for any reason. Reports from various early riders, Waymo One users, local reporters, public videos, and a former safety driver suggest that the safety drivers take over completely in ordinary rain and even when parking in the Waymo depot. We have seen video of safety drivers turning left for the cars, and users have reported that the safety drivers sometimes drive the car to a better drop off or pick up point.

Cameras and processing hardware is a fair point.  I don't believe radar is an option that companies are realistically going to pursue.

&gt; Plus 1k for a lidar sensor is basically nonexistent

Sure, and Tesla FSD is also non-existent right now.  Everyone believes that Tesla FSD will get there eventually, but in that ""eventually"" period, $1k LIDAR will become reality, maybe even cheaper.

If that ""eventually"" is more than two years from now, the price of LIDAR will become significantly less relevant to the discussion.

And again, Elon Musk says that the price of Tesla FSD will continue to increase, which will increase the headspace for other companies.  Tesla FSD is supposed to increase very shortly for the release of V10.

&gt; 2k to create the software isn’t enough.

You're assuming that companies need to turn a profit immediately, but most companies trade profits for marketshare when they are trying to first establish themselves.

Remember if you have a working system I can replace a part of it and compare the output. So let's say my perception system depends on Lidar, if I run a second perception system and give the input to the predication and planning systems, I can see where the other parts of the system do different things. Then I can decide if the new system perceived something wrong, or did it surpass the other system. I can then focus on the delta's between systems, and improve the new system very quickly.

So imagine you have a fleet of L4 cars but they are so expensive they can't be run profitably. That is awesome, because you have data. That data can be used to make your system less expensive, and perform increasingly better. 

I would use more crutches if we have them. Like lifting the car so it rides higher up, and can avoid more obstacles on the road. Armoring the car so it has even better crash protection.

It's like giving someone a phone without a sim chip and asking them to evaluate it.  Sure they can play some games and surf the web but it's fundamentally a different experience.

&gt; IF the car works she could mount goPro cameras all over it and use it all over the geofenced area for a week.

Just mount some goPro cameras on each trip you take.  Bit of a pain, but should be doable as long as Waymo works with you.

&gt; The only reason it would be ""difficult"" to lend out the car is if Waymo has something to hide.

No, it's one reason.  They would have to build a special usage model just for this.  What doe it do when you get to the shopping mall?  It isn't designed to park and wait for you.  Do you manually park it?  Sort of defeats the purpose.  What if the sensors are dirty, is the reporter going to clean them?  What if the car needs repair?  These are all things handled by fleet operations that you are asking them to unplug it from.

&gt; If you just let the reporter use Waymo One service they will have safety drivers!

They don't have to.  They already do rides without saftey drivers.  The saftey drivers could be instructed by Wayo to exit the vehicle if the reporter is the passenger.  The saftey driver could ride in the back with the reporter.

&gt; In fact, we have ample evidence now that they don't work.

Whenever I get into someone’s car with LKA I ask if they use it, and usually get a response like, “it doesn’t steer for me like I thought,” “it messes with my driving,” or “I hate it because I don’t always use blinkers.” 

It’s good technology don’t get me wrong, but LKA is misnomer imo, and I think it’s making a lot of people distrustful of the new more capable systems from the beginning.

A major difference can be explained that in the Kia you can steer with the LFA assist on. While with the Tesla it’s either driving or you’re driving, you can’t steer on top of Autopilot without disabling the system. 

Try to do some research on Ford Copilot 360 Assist+, Toyota Lane Tracing, KIA LFA, Honda Sensing, Volvo Propilot etc... There’s very little reviews or literature on how these systems work. Most that I’ve test driven are not very clear about when they are actively steering for you. Ford’s lane centering will make a “bong” noise only some of the time in my car when lane centering disables.

Manufacturers are being very hesitant to advertise or embrace the technology they’ve created, but it’s arguably the most important factor in cars.

Is that not how it's calculated? I'm also assuming here that with a simple system there would be about 8 hours of 1kw or more, and that the peak would be wasted in the even that you just had a 1kw demand for 8 hours, which is inefficient, but also less inefficient than what we see with batteries due to their high costs.

You can do that on a very sunny day, but that does not matter, what matters is the average day, and on that day, 3kw of panels will give you about 13kwh in California, enough for about 550w all day.   Some days you might get 1kw (or even a touch more) all day.  Other days you will get squat.

Anyway, to put tons of solar on the grid, it is necessary to have a crapload of storage.  These new cells might help with that if they can be manufactured in bulk at low cost.   But we really need a lot of storage for those peak days.   If the Nuke+hydro+wind can provide the baseload, then the batteries have to provide all the power above the baseload from late in the afternoon until 8am.  Which on a hot day I will guess is about 100 GWH (About $10=15B) for California if it's purely sunny, but a great deal more because you must deal with strings of non-sunny days.

It was because it was braking for no clear reason.

Look at the recent Comma.ai Medium post about AEB data from their Data set. There are a few false positives they show examples of and you can see why self driving cars have issues with being rear ended.

523,MitsubishiGalant,"&gt;Mitsubishi became the first OEM to offer an adaptive cruise control system after equipping its 1995 Diamante sedan with a Preview Distance Control system, which introduced lidar in the front bumper and a miniature camera mounted in the rear-view mirror. It was able to sense when the distance to the vehicle ahead was closing and would automatically ease off the accelerator or make the transmission downshift to slow the car. Its limitation, however, was that it could not operate the brakes, so when the speed difference with the vehicle in front was too great, it had to resort to alerting the driver with audible and visual warnings.

Okay, but what if a car is just a little crooked in it's parking spot and I need to run a little over the line to get by? A human would do this without slowing down while a Waymo sees a car a bit in the way and a yellow line and just stops. Then gets rear ended. It isn't driving naturally which causes rear end collisions. Humans break these traffic rules all the time, and FSD cars will have to also bend and break rules if they are ever to drive along with humans in the same environment successfully. 

There should also be a limit on braking force. If the car starts to exceed something like 3m/s^2 then it should alert the safety driver to take over. This would help with rear end collisions as well if the Waymo cars NEVER decelerate quickly on their own. 

You see people in traffic pull over when braking hard behind quickly stopping cars all the time, it's to avoid getting rear ended/rear ending the car in front because they know it's a dangerous maneuver. 

I don't know what Waymo does in heavy braking situations but it should definitely do something natural or default to the human safety driver when it's going beyond smooth driving limits.",1568136838,eztr8oa,t1_eztq6it,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw
528,AnthAmbassador,"Largely agree.

If people heat with electrical, there will be massive excess power in the summer if the grid is powered in a large part by solar. The reason I'm concerned with solar is that it's universally applicable, cheaper, and more consistent than wind. There are windy places that this won't be true for, and many places could use a high altitude wind kite if that is successful. I'm deeply skeptical it will be cheap like solar, though it could be a good non nuclear base load. Solar will continue to grow cheaper and cheaper, and I expect it's affordability will eventually be so compelling that enormous arrays will be set up and it will create the only time during which cheap charging can be done.

Long term I think we will see more than 110% capacity, because having vehicles distributed so as to be closer to riders means that they will be chosen preferentially by customers, they won't need to use energy to travel to the customer, and if the infrastructure is there, they can be economically productive just engaging in load balancing, however, in the short term I expect that there will be insufficiency self driving cars to meet demand, and they will likely not spend time leveling demand.

Then use data from your fleet to determine areas where the system is engaged with zero accidents and zero human intervention. Say a stretch of interstate highway between cities. Once you have a few million miles of data showing that the system is reliable in that corridor you can roll out Level 3 in those areas and get the insurance policy for level 3 in that area by showing the data to the insurer.

Agreed.  How regulation plays out will determine if we are sitting in cars by ourselves stuck in even worse traffic than before or we have to make multiple transfers between high capacity mass transit.  Hopefully we end up somewhere in the middle.

&gt; I don't think 100% DOD is really a big deal. even if you're in an area with a smaller difference between peak and the surrounding hours, it seems logical to just have extra vehicles so you can take some out of service before they get so drained that they're shortening battery life.

100% DOD is huge, not because it makes something possible but because of the cost savings.  As you pointed out, there are certainly options even if you can only use 60% of battery capacity.  However, 100% DOD allows you to cut battery size by 40% which at current prices and assuming comparable prices between the two technologies, would be a huge cost reduction.

yeah, the data I've seen has a lot of variabilities from set to set, location to location.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Left to the market, you will always have a system that exceeds road capacity. With a healthy amount of regulation you can probably get a system that is constantly pushing the limits of road capacity. To build something where there is always spare capacity would require regulations that would either make transit more expensive or less convenient than it could be and would be tough politically to keep up. 

yeah, I think this is one of the biggest challenges of self-driving cars: creating a structure such that we don't get choked by the induced demand. though, I think it will be a lot more politically acceptable to limit vehicles, due to the ability to make a 3+ person shuttle economical. also, right now, there is a barrier to getting people onto public transit since they already own a car, and they don't know the logistics of which bus/train combinations they need or don't like the on-time performance. if you already don't own a car, and you just have to request a pickup of a shared shuttle like you did the taxi, those big hurtles go away. I'm also a huge fan of The Boring Company's concept, which is 8-16 passenger mini-buses in a tunnel. you can move as many people as a medium-size metro if you have a road where every vehicle has \~10 people inside. then, the minibusses leave the tunnel and do the local pick-up/drop off. I hope TBC's tunnels cost continues to go down; they're already bidding a fraction of the cost of a typical metro and plan for an even lower cost.

it also might be possible, if governments have foresight, to immediately make the switch as the tech comes on the scene. cities could start congestion charging low occupancy taxis as well as subsidizing shuttle services if they agree to meet performance metrics as a bus replacement. thus, there would be a carrot and stick early-on and people would never get used to cheap individual taxis. however, that requires city governments to have foresight, which is asking a lot.",1568086703,ezsc01g,t1_ezs2t4a,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

564,AnthAmbassador,"That's not going to add up to all day. The morning rush is predominantly before solar max and the evening rush after. Besides along with the disruption of drivers jobs, there's reason to assume that work in general, especially commutes will be different.

Your clearly not familiar with grid demand. The fluctuation between peak demands and least demands are very small. The problem is that you need to meet all the demand and you need to consume all the production at night, which means the b entire base load of production needs to be consumed, and these days, we consume it. A lot of it is industrial that never stops going. Industrial and commercial power use is two thirds of the total, commercial doesn't slump nearly as much as residential. There really isn't that big of a drop in demand, just enough that it forces them to consider turning down a combined cycle or coal or nuclear that would ideally never fluctuate.

If we have a purely renewable energy economy, it will be very hard to maintain efficiency in those sectors. It's also the case that in many places, the wind isn't reliably coming on every night, so it gets really hard to meet demands without uncertainty, which is why solar is nice, even in the winter when it's cloudy, you know what you're going to get out of it. If you come up with high energy consumption processes to burn off summer power on, you can design the capacity for worst case winter, and make liquid fuel or heat up huge sections of ground to draw on for winter heat when you have extra electricity.",1568066829,ezr1ffq,t1_ezqnntu,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

567,Dirty_Socks,"Batteries getting larger is itself a huge improvement. We can store on average 7% more per year in new li-ion cells, which is a huge improvement. We are also reducing the costs by a huge amount. Li-ion cells cost less than a quarter to produce now than they did 10 years ago. 

Additionally, there are significant improvements in fast charging technology. A lot of that is in cell chemistry to allow such high currents without permanently damaging the internals. Now you can fully charge a battery in 30-60 minutes instead of in four hours. 

We are also seeing improvements in cell life and temperature resistance. There are additionally several new chemistries out there. Originally li-ions had a nominal voltage of 3.6V, now all commodity cells are 3.7V with some higher end ones being 3.8V.

even for personal cars, there is a 25% drop pretty quickly after peak. however, the only reason cars aren't more peaky is because people spread out due to traffic demand exceeding capacity. if the goal of self driving cars is to have 1 person per vehicle, then you'll only get that 25% peak vs base. if you look at something like a subway that does not exceed capacity, then you see the real demand curve for transportation. in my mind, the world would suck if we get SDCs and the only result is that everyone takes an individual taxis and traffic gets worse than it is now. my dream is shared shuttles so the total number of vehicles on the road goes down.",1568056276,ezq92gm,t1_ezq7o25,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

571,WeldAE,"&gt; I somewhat disagree that the depth of discharge for SDC is going to be 100%.

Did the article mention this and I missed it?  I just saw temperature testing.  Going to 100% discharge every day would destroy today's batteries.  So I 100% agree they won't do it.

&gt; You will need roughly twice the vehicles at peak time than you do off-peak....

I think I disagree with you but I guess it depends on how you define peak and off peak.  Assuming that SDC demand follows the same curve that total passenger cars on the road at any given time does, there isn't much of a peak.  Traffic is basically nothing between mid-night and 6am before rush hour starts.  From 6am to 7pm traffic is pretty constant in most top 100 cities in the US.  From 7pm to 8pm traffic is pretty light and from 8pm to mid-night it's basically nothing again.

So if you define ""off-peak"" to be 7pm to 6am then I disagree because we need about 100x more cars during the peak period.  If you define peak to be morning and evening rush hours then I also disagree because peak traffic is during the evening rush but it's only 10% higher than the lowest point which is around 10am and 2pm.

Rush hour is rush hour only because everyone is going to the same places.  At lunch traffic is just as high but it's widely distributed throughout the city.",1568055796,ezq7o25,t1_ezm7wu4,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

Example would be Tesla’s super bottle a HVAC system that other companies can’t do because of the infrastructure. Also think how tesla is able to expand and innovate they spend all the money the obtain from investors, founders, and consumers on R&amp;D and development/expansion (giga factory in China build in 7 months and now testing the M3 line) as well as their position in the trade war compared to all the other companies.

597,AnthAmbassador,"You don't understand what I'm saying. You're looking at the total gain as thought it came at 100% intensity. That 4.5 average equivalent hours is stretched over the period of daylight, during which about 8 hours are fairly sunny. This is the ""duck curve"" period.

Clearly, if you want to get 8KW of solar over 8 hours, you need nearly 2kw of actual solar capacity, and you need and MPPT charge controller so as to acutally get the total instead of failing to get peak charge at peak insolation, but I was trying to simplify the calculation heavily to make it more digestible. 

If we're talking about self driving cars, I suspect that they will be mostly charged at sundown, or they will have validated their existence by driving a lot of people around. If they are primarily rush hour commute oriented, they will charge during peak insolation before the commute home starts, even if they don't get to charge during the commute period at all.

If you're talking about personal vehicles, they can be plugged in at parking lots where people work, which would allow them to gain solar charge, and likely have excess to help level off the grid later on.

It's also possible to run heavy heating and cooling loads during peak insolation, and with high quality construction that seals air flow and insulates, you can get a large portion of your energy consumption packed into the the primary insolation period.

Unfortunately it is not nearly as simple as you suggest.  Demand varies through the day, and at peak (6-7pm) on a hot day is more than twice night demand.   And just then the solar all shuts off, fast.   So on the hottest days California wants 50gw and all the solar just went off and the nukes are running and the hydro switches on full, but still you need a LOT of battery to deal with that.

602,AnthAmbassador,"The cheap night time power situation is likely not going to last. The cheaper solar gets, and it's pretty cheap now in terms of raw cost per kwh generated, the more solar will be installed, which will lead to a massive flooding of the market for peak sunlight conditions without any real plan for what that solar is going to power. This will likely cause a crash of daytime prices of electricity in high solar areas, and a rise in cost overnight. 

Vehicles in large total battery capacity fleets might have the ability to power the grid, either for stabilization or for meeting demand during low solar periods, but the reality is that batteries are really expensive still. The costs of providing power during the day are very cheap, providing power later from battery sources is really expensive.

Quick math: providing a kw of solar during the sunny period is just a 1 kw panel (super oversimplified, yes) if you don't want more than 8 hours a day on average.

If you want 1kw all day you need 3kw of panels and 2kw charge up batteries while 1 kw provides power during the day, and this gets you 24 hours of power, but that means you need to store 16 hours worth of power in a battery that can be charged at twice the rate that you're asking for power to be supplied to the grid, which is a bit of a demand, and you're going to make a 16kwh battery, which is bigger than but pretty close to the size of a tesla powerwall, which you could get installed and running for maybe 10 grand

Maybe if you get a good deal and do most of the work yourself, a solar system is around 1000 dollars for 1 kw. So if you want 8 hours of solar power, you're gonna pay 1 grand, and if you want to have 24 hours of solar power, you're gonna pay 13 grand.

Storage is currently horrendously expensive, and if you have a car, to charge it will take a lot more. Even a tiny eletric car has more capacity than a powerwall. A small one is often 3 powerwalls worth of power capacity, a monster like the P100D would suck down 9 powerwalls to charge to full.

The robotaxi problem has several factors.  Almost all vehicles are down at night and power is cheapest at night. You want a taxi to be able to last a day to take advantage of that.  However, you can take a portion of your taxis down from 10am to 11:30 and 1:30 to 3 for some partial recharging -- at daytime rates.

In the end EVs are more efficient and the reliability has been proven. The reliability is now on the way to million mile life on the drive trains for EVs. 

Trucking requires high efficiency which EVs provide. Hydrogen will not be able to provide the efficiency required for trucking.

This creates an “air curtain” that actually deflects bugs away from the sensor itself.

Humans have these same accidents. This isn't new

&gt;As an engineer I just don’t believe a $600 cell phone like device is a sufficiently safe solution for self driving on public roads.

I dont't disagree. But then I don't think most drivers license holders are sufficiently safe for driving on public roads. Especially the elderly.

Honestly I don't feel less safe on the Road with these systems. But not because I think they are safe, but because of the poor ability of most drivers in America.

You are right, we probably shouldn't allow systems like this on the road. But we should also have a much higher bar for getting and maintaining a drivers license. 
But in the end it boils down to what we find acceptable as a society.

A bus, or off of a ledge over someone’s house?

I worked at google X for a while and saw how much effort Waymo is putting in to their self driving. They’re taking safety very very seriously, which is what I would expect for this application. As an engineer I just don’t believe a $600 cell phone like device is a sufficiently safe solution for self driving on public roads. Like I said it can work for a long time, but self driving is notorious for having a huge field of edge cases. I also know that lane following isn’t a complicated problem. I’m a robotics engineer. I could write an application that does lane following. But I would consider it irresponsible to run my own code on public roads, because again the risks are just really high and it’s endangering innocent people. And why?

807,WeldAE,"&gt; ...they can probably succeed. 

I agree.  I also agree with you we should basically ignore it other than to point out to government why they shouldn't pervert markets like this.

&gt;  I see no reason that urban taxis for 1-2 people, made by the millions, will not cost under $10K including their sensors.

This is a good point and I agree but I think that sort of car would do better in the suburbs.  In the core of the city, at least while manual cars still exist, I think you need something a bit more capacity.  That said, I still think $15k rolling stock costs is very low and will be an obvious valid point of disagreement when trying to convince someone SDCs can be done cheaply.  The authors themselves even said that increasing the costs by 2x or 3x wouldn't really change the analysis much.  If you double the service life to 1m miles, it matters even less.  I'd still go for a $10k 400k mile car if it's possible though, especially in the early days.

&gt; ...people would not ride in robocars even if the price were higher than using a private car or transit.

I don't think they made this claim for public transit and even cite papers saying people will pay 5x more for private transit Vs. public transit that is faster.  They also said that if you take opportunity costs of your time into account that SDCs win easily.  I would say the main point of the paper is that SDCs will cost more per mile unless you value your time.  They indicate that they think people will.

That doesn't mean that they are right about the costs.  They basically say that taking the driver out of a current $3.55/mile taxi and replacing them with a very costly remote monitoring system is more than driving your own car, holding everything else the same.  As I said, it's a good starting point that is hard to argue with and then you can expand and explain how savings will be achieved better than a 100 year old corrupt taxi industry.",1567656559,ez2lf15,t1_ez092fg,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

824,sdcsighted,"I posted this a while ago in the context of Quanergy, but it’s also definitely applicable here (I originally read it as a Quora comment):

&gt;You see, back then, this guy, Joseph Sugarman adopted a marketing tactic[2] that goes like this:

&gt;Suppose that everyone believes Nikon is the best camera that a consumer or a low level pro can buy. Nikon has spent hundreds of millions in research and development to get their cameras where they are. They spend a lot of promotional money (big money) to keep that brand recognizable.

&gt;So someone like Sugarman comes along and says, how can I make money off Nikon? So he finds a competent Japanese company that can make an excellent camera, but without a well known name. He checks it out. It is pretty good. Maybe not quite Nikon, but a good value. So he puts some new name on the product, and then he takes out full page ads that read something like this:

&gt;JS&amp;A XD7500 camera offers Nikon $5 million if Nikon D7500 can beat the JS&amp;A XD7500 in a fair contest

&gt;The ad features a picture of the camera, and a picture of the $5 million check. It also spells out that there will be a variety of models and scenery that represent normal photographic and lighting conditions. It will also suggest a panel of judges from photographic societies and magazines.

&gt;This game has been played again and again with audiophile equipment, radar detectors, fast cars, tires, you name it. The number of times that the big name has taken the bait is exactly zero.

&gt;Here’s what happens. The challenge is never answered. The knock-off product gets a big jump in sales because it looks like the big name is afraid of the challenger.

&gt;Here’s why no one takes the challenge: Even being in the same contest with the challenger gives some credibility to the challenger. Even if the big name accepted the challenge, JS&amp;A only loses a check but still gets publicity for it. If by some chance the big name took the challenge, what would happen? The scoring has been set up so that scores will be close. The big product gets a score of 95 and the challenger gets a score of 91. At that point a lot of people will say: “I don’t have $2000 for the Nikon, but at $800, the JS&amp;A is almost as good.” The challenger still does not lose. But JS&amp;A never expects to have to pay out on the check. The big name is not ever going to take the challenge.",1567644023,ez0zrs9,t3_czm2ug,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

You're saying they have to play by the rules which slows them down, and then give examples where OpenPilot might possibly hypothetically fail; and if a specific regulation existed to fix that and the closed-source company had already accommodated that regulation, then the closed-source company would be able to do something that OpenPilot would not.

This is a complete non-sequitur, akin to arguing about the trolley problem for self-driving cars.  If OpenPilot can perform better than the competition, then it can perform better than the competition.  How you define ""better"" is complicated, but you're completely sidestepping the main issue - OpenPilot is throwing down the gauntlet that they can outperform anybody.  If that is true I don't give a shit about regulation, because it obviously hampers safety because it's just making everybody less safe.  If the purpose of the regulation is to make it safer at some point in the future, then maybe at some point in the future it will be the better choice.

$15K is actually a high price for a single occupancy vehicle.  You can buy a Twizzy for about $10K and that's a low volume vehicle.  I see no reason that urban taxis for 1-2 people, made by the millions, will not cost under $10K including their sensors.

But their strangest assumption was that people would not ride in robocars even if the price were higher than using a private car or transit.

&gt; The Kiwibots do not figure out their own routes. Instead, people in Colombia, the home country of Chavez and his two co-founders, plot “waypoints” for the bots to follow, sending them instructions every five to 10 seconds on where to go.

&gt; As with other offshoring arrangements, the labor savings are huge. **The Colombia workers, who can each handle up to three robots**, make less than $2 an hour, which is above the local minimum wage.

&gt; ...

&gt; Another cost saving is that human assistance means the robots don’t need pricey equipment such as lidar sensors to “see” around them.

&gt; ...

&gt; The bots navigate the short distances between waypoints on their own and use AI to avoid pedestrians and stay centered on the sidewalk, Kiwi said. GPS lets the Colombian operators see the robot on a street map while onboard video cameras show them a robot’s-eye view of its surroundings. The lag time is just 150 milliseconds, less than the blink of an eye, Iatsenia said.

&gt; **The company bristles at comparisons of this to operating remote-control toy cars, calling it “parallel autonomy.”**

&gt; ...

&gt; On the ground in Berkeley, people also do a lot of robot support. **Traveling at 1 to 1½ mph, the bots would take too long to chug to local restaurants, so Kiwi workers pick up the food at restaurants and take it via bikes or scooters to meeting spots around campus to insert into an insulated bag in the bots’ storage compartment.**

910,TuftyIndigo,"That's a fair and important point. In general (not speaking about a particular case), even if a crash is ""caused by"" human error or misbehaviour, you still ought to consider the rest of the system. Could that opportunity for error be removed? Could you protect against misbehaving humans? The automotive industry has historically been weak in thinking in that way - in part because they focus on liability so much - but other safety-critical fields have done better. I think it's an important attitude to have whether you're dealing with accidents in a safety-critical system, money loss in a banking website, or even just sending a message to the wrong person in a social app.

Keeping this attitude in mind, I think it's still important to look at *all* the evidence in situations like this. There does seem to be a trend that a lot of people who've had Autopilot-related accidents also had lots of crashes before buying a Tesla, and often buy the Tesla specifically for the Autopilot feature. Could it be similar to the ""Volvo effect""? (It's often thought that Volvo drivers have more crashes because Volvos have a reputation for crash-safety, so bad drivers buy Volvos so that they'll be protected if they crash.) If there is an effect like that, then maybe that tells us something about how the Autopilot feature is marketed and sold, or it something wider about the adoption of ADAS features - and the future use of cars with actual self-driving capability.",1567584557,eyyfk2s,t1_eyxdb59,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

941,borisst,"&gt; No one (up to that point) knew foam impact could cause real structural damage, which is why they didn't even bother with tile inspection in orbit until after that incident.

Of course they did know that foam impact can damage the heat shield, and that may cause structural damage. It happened before. They were aware that if the hit 

[STS-27](https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts119/090327sts27/):

&gt; But 85 seconds after launch, a piece of insulation on the tip of the shuttle's right-side solid-fuel booster broke away and struck Atlantis' right side. The impact was not noted on NASA television at the time and after landing, NASA engineers said that while the shuttle had suffered more tile damage than usual, ""it isn't something that's of a major concern.""

&gt; But as it turned out, the damage was, in fact, extensive. More than 700 heat shield tiles were damaged. One tile on the shuttle's belly near the nose was completely missing **and the underlying metal - a thick mounting plate that helped anchor an antenna - was partially melted**. In a slightly different location, the missing tile could have resulted in a catastrophic burn through.

They were lucky because of the location of the missing tile over the thick mounting plate. This was real structural damage.

Damage to the heat shield continued:

[STS-87](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/02/23/columbia-marked-by-delay-faults/89bb13ee-306f-4430-8b34-1930722f2633/):

&gt; But what happened on Columbia shuttle flight STS-87 in November 1997 sent engineers back to the drawing board.

&gt; Returning from 15 days in orbit, the Columbia's tiles were badly battered. A postflight inspection showed that 308 tiles had been damaged, 109 with cracks or divots greater than an inch on the shuttle's vulnerable lower surface, which encounters the greatest heat on reentry.

&gt; NASA's Gregory N. Katnik led the search for the cause. The culprit turned out to be debris shed by the foam used to insulate the shuttle's external fuel tank. ""Foam cause damage to a ceramic tile!"" Katnik said in a report later posted in an online newsletter. ""That seems unlikely. However, when that foam is combined with a flight velocity between speeds of MACH two to MACH four, it becomes a projectile with incredible damage potential.""

It was a problem that continued to plague the shuttle and was never resolved satisfactorily. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_external_tank#Thermal_protection_system):

&gt; NASA had difficulty preventing fragments of foam from detaching during flight for the entire history of the program:

&gt; * STS-1, 1981: Crew reports white material streaming past windows during orbiter-external-tank flight. Crew estimated sizes from 1/4-inch to fist-sized. Post-landing report describes probable foam loss of unknown location, and 300 tiles needing outright replacement due to various causes.

&gt; * STS-4, 1982: PAL ramp loss; 40 tiles require outright replacement.

&gt; * STS-5, 1982: Continued high rate of tile loss.

&gt; * STS-7, 1983: 50 by 30 cm (20 by 12 in) Bipod ramp loss photographed, dozens of spot losses.[12]

&gt; * STS-27, 1988: One large loss of uncertain origin, causing one total tile loss. Hundreds of small losses.

&gt; * STS-32, 1990: Bipod ramp loss photographed; five spot losses up to 70 cm in diameter, plus tile damages.[13]

&gt; * STS-50, 1992: Bipod ramp loss. 20×10×1 cm tile damage.[13]

&gt; * STS-52, 1992: Portion of bipod ramp, jackpad lost. 290 total tile marks, 16 greater than an inch.

957,borisst,"&gt; What actually dangerous things have Waymo cars been up to?

They have safety drivers that take control when the system fails. 

The question is what dangerous things would Waymo cars have done without safety drivers. In other words, how many time and under what circumstances did Waymo safety drivers disengage the system?

In California, they are supposed to report disengagements related to safety, but they obfuscate it as much as they can. They report the following reasons for disengagements, which are not informative at all:

&gt; 1. Disengage for unwanted maneuver of the vehicle that was undesirable under the circumstances.

&gt; 2. Disengage for a perception discrepancy for which a component of the vehicle's perception system failed to detect an object correctly.

&gt; 3. Disengage for a recklessly behaving road user.

Compare that to Nuro, which reported:

&gt; 1. Object perception: briefly lost track of lead vehicle resulting in planned trajectory with insufficient braking.

&gt; 2. Onboard map: map inaccuracy resulted in planned trajectory that would have contacted curb on right turn.

&gt; 3. Agent prediction: inadequate cyclist prediction leads to a planned right turn trajectory with inadequate yield.

&gt; 4.  Agent prediction: child riding scooter in road in cicles, lack of accurate prediciton results in planned trajectory with inadequate yield.

You can easily tell that without disengagements they would have rear-ended a vehicle, hit the curb, hit a cyclist, and hit a child riding a scooter.

You can't make any conclusions about Waymo because they don't give you the information. I've mentioned other problems in a [previous comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/blqwjo/gm_cruise_raises_115b_at_a_19b_valuation_from/emu92jw/).

11,meiyouL5,"I was under this impression for a long time -- a year or two. Always felt like launch was imminent. Now, I'm more and more convinced they're slipping away from the #1 spot and it's anyone's game unless they can fix various hurdles. Here's why:

1. Waymo's current status is limited -- seemingly very limited -- access on a small fleet of vehicles in a geolocked area. They still have safety drivers in almost all cars (certainly all that we've seen, which makes me think full driverless is Early Access/NDA only), and they still have lots of complaints: random braking, inefficient routes to avoid left turns, avoiding highways, etc.
2. Waymo's testing area is suburb focused. In theory, this is the easiest environment to drive in. The only exception would be high-speed unprotected left turns, but that is something a computer \*should\* be good at. Why isn't it?
3. Other companies are testing only or primarily in cities and have demonstrated abilities to handle unprotected lefts while also dodging pedestrians, cyclists, double parked cars, etc. (Cruise, Zoox). This is easier at lower speeds, but still more complicated than what Waymo seems capable of handling at the moment.
4. Waymo is hiring like crazy. They've got the largest staff by far of any SDC company. Yet, they don't seem closer to launch today than they were a year ago. And they're hiring ML/DL people like mad. This makes me suspect they might be looking at major rewrites of the software to handle the unknowns of real-world driving better. Waymo's codebase is the oldest in the industry and stems from academic projects back when driving in a desert or controlled course was a huge feat. This makes me really suspicious that they have some approaches in their codebase that will not scale to handle real-world scenarios and need to be rebuilt with DL/ML instead of heuristics.
5. With regards to losing the top spot, I'm also really concerned about what happens to companies when they have huge staffing efforts behind delayed launches. Do you get a 'too many cooks' situation? Are the factors that slow down development at Google also relevant at Waymo now?

Waymo's launch delay is the primary factor here, and not one I can do anything but speculate on. I appreciate that they are not launching a driverless service that might not be 100% safe, if that's the reason. At the very least though, I expect Waymo to not be the first to launch city service, unless the tales of tech debt at Cruise are to be taken seriously.",1567476549,eyuzsid,t1_eyrm2k1,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

35,borisst,"Yes, there's an inherent tradeoff between minimizing false positives (braking when not needed) and minimizing false negatives (not breaking when needed).

For example, braking for stationary objects detected by radar would result in constant braking for metal manhole covers, overhead signs, etc. So Tesla Autopilot (and others) does not stop for stationary objects. The result is multiple crashes into firetrucks stopped at the side of the road, a fatal crash into street sweepers, fatal crashes into tractor trailers crossing the road, and a fatal crash into a lane divider.

For self-driving to work, the rate of both false positives and false negatives must be extremely low **at the same time**. By having a safety driver, a company like Uber can reduce false positives (by [not braking at all](https://www.businessinsider.com/sources-describe-questionable-decisions-and-dysfunction-inside-ubers-self-driving-unit-before-one-of-its-cars-killed-a-pedestrian-2018-10)), and rely on a safety driver to handle the false negatives this introduces.

&gt; Sources say engineers were pressured to ""tune"" the self-driving car for a smoother ride in preparation of a big year-end demonstration of their progress, **but that meant not allowing the car to respond to everything it saw, real or not.**

&gt;For example, if the sensors detect a stop sign, [SIFT] will recognize its eight corners as key points, cross check it with similar images in the database, and inevitably conclude that the image is of a stop sign.

i mean, i guess if you did a bunch of post processing on the SIFT results, you could do it. it wouldn't be ""inevitably"" because it would fail half the time, but you could do it. did you read the papers?

&gt; You Only Look Once (YOLO) is an algorithm that analyzes an entire image, breaks it down into its constituent parts, identifies relevant parts based on pre-taught specifications for certain objects, places these parts into boundary boxes, and then makes predictions about how these objects are going to move. This allows an AV to understand how a given situation is going to evolve.

i don't think they read the papers.

&gt;Other common algorithms include TextonBoost, which analyzes images based on their shape, appearance, and context, and AdaBoost, which increases the performance of algorithms by optimally pairing them with the strengths and weaknesses of other algorithms.

neither of those are ""common"" for avs. textonboost is a segmentation algorithm from 2007 that takes several seconds per frame.

the ""new progress"" section is interesting because the three examples of new progress are all summaries of abstracts from Vol. 4, Issue 28 of AAAS Science Robotics, which the writer must have gotten a copy of somehow. this part shows some degree of effort and should be commended.

It's about modernizing regulations to deal with cars that don't have a human driver. There are many regulations on the books that simply don't make any sense if a person isn't driving the car.

As for why we'd want a AI only driven car...

* It'd be cheaper if you didn't have to include a separate mechanism for a human to drive
* It'd be safer if the car could be assured to be under a predictable AI control at all times rather than have to deal with the unpredictability that a person could start driving. For example, you could have intersections without traffic lights or stop signs, platooning, and so on...
* You'd have greater freedom to design the car's interior like back facing seats in the front
* It'd could have greater crash safety by being able to remove more things a person in the car might smash into like a steering wheel

Basically either the AI works or it doesn't. If it works, there is little reason to give the person the capability to drive. If it doesn't, the AI car shouldn't be on the road. There'll be a small transition time where AI only works under certain circumstances, but that's going to be brief so it's better to start planning now for when that won't be the case.",1567236871,eyn8x83,t1_eykw0m1,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

I frame this all up though as how will this affect new ICE car sales in the early 2020s.  Lets say there is a rollout of Waymo in the greater Los Angeles Metro area.  That would free up a lot of people from driving, including myself.  A lot of people would sell their cars to folks who live outside the area an don't have Waymo (Or Tesla, or who ever else does it first).   The other thing is, the hot new cars that are taking ahold of the premium market are EVs, in 2024, people in a world of Warmo and really cool EVs are not going to fork over serious money for a gas only car they have to drive themselves.

140,WeldAE,"&gt; Even most leaders in the field are not as optimistic as this sub seems to be.

Hard to say as I'm not 100% sure what the most common level of optimism on this sub is.  I know my personal guess is they will be deployed in the top 10 major cities by 2025 but for all I know that is pessimistic compared to most on this sub.  Compared to the ""leaders"" which I take to be Waymo, GM, Tesla, etc.  I would say I am wildly pessimistic.  I think most of the sub thinks Tesla is wildly optimistic.  So I don't know, it's just a guessing game since I haven't seen the sub polled.

&gt; Just wanted to add a critical voice.

I don't disagree with most of your facts, I just don't follow them to the same conclusion that we need to tread slowly.  Nothing wrong with that, I just don't think you can hold back any technology so we can plan all the 2nd and 3rd order consequences. 

&gt; what does that mean for public space and individual privacy?

In the US at least you don't have any privacy on the public roads.  If a camera captures you in public but no one looks at it, did it capture you?  With the ultra cheap price of cameras, I think privacy in almost all spheres of life is going away and is completely independent of SDCs.  I fully expect phones to be processing video continuously in the next 10 years the same way Alexa and Siri are always listening.

&gt; there is this idea that avs will be electric but not all are!

They will be but to date none are, or at least none that matter much.  The timing was just off by a couple of years for Waymo to use an electric platform from the start but they will eventually switch.  It's still early days and right now it's more about getting miles under their belt even if it is on a terrible platform.

&gt; So why are these companies promising more energy efficiency?

I haven't hear that one before.  I'm just guessing, by maybe it's from producing less cars per year?  A SDC can replace 8-10 cars since they aren't sitting around idle 95% of the time.  EVs can be used for 1M miles rather than 150k miles per car.  Producing a car takes a lot of energy so thus the savings?  Just a guess but maybe it's something else entirely.

&gt; And adding all the longer journeys due to the elimination of carparks in urban areas means more driving time...

How is removing carparks making the journey longer?  Do you mean that they will have significant deadhead miles to pickup the next fare?  For certain trips, this will certainly be true.  For others, not spending time finding a parking spot will shorten them.  As long as a fare can be found nearby or they can find a close taxi pickup queue they can park in, it should be shorter.  Longer term, all that parking being removed could make the city more dense allowing more people to live in the city because of cheaper housing and significantly reducing the miles driven.  Of course that is all probably moot and offset by other changes.  Most are pretty sure making driving cheap and easy will increase everyone miles driven per year.

&gt; ..and all of the potential issues need to be ironed out before they hit the road.

You could sit down and put 1m people on the problem for the next 10 years before the first car launches.  The 2nd week after launch you might as well burn all that planning because there are too many variables.  You have to implement and make changes as you go.  What NYC needs to do will be very different than what Atlanta needs to do and Europe will looking nothing like anything in the US.  

I'm all for working out the issues and speculating on the future but I can't wrap my head around holding up progress while I or politicians try and work it out.

Since nothing about the conditions had changed and the car didn’t do anything crazy, and the low speeds I wanted to see if it would recover or not.

I feel like they are finally starting to feel the pain and are developing an urgency that they are about to deploy a bunch of vehicles that are fundamentally not well suited for the job.

&gt; ...NHTSA should first work on addressing those safety standards that assume a human is behind the wheel before revising rules to address alternative seating configurations...NHTSA does not plan to begin writing rules on seating positions until March 2020. 

New seating arrangements will be a nice to have and are much easier to reconfigure after the fact if they become a big issue than the entire cockpit of the car.  Seating arrangements also take a long time to test and work out what will and won't work from a saftey and usability perspective.

&gt; Many automakers plan remote controls to pilot autonomous vehicles through factories or onto trucks. 

I haven't heard this before.  I guess I assumed they would do something like this but it's interesting to hear what is being planed by the companies themselves.

&gt; New York City told NHTSA it should ensure self-driving cars meet baseline performance requirements including “a high rate of accurate pedestrian and cyclist detection from all angles, the application of the brakes in time to stop the vehicle prior to a collision, and the maintenance of safe and legal speeds.” 

NYC needs to be kicked out of the conversation.  They are obviously just in it to slow down progress by suggesting that SDCs are inherently unsafe.  The statement above is so obvious in what it suggests as to be condescending to the industry.  I predict that NYC will be the last major city to get SDCs.

Adaptive cruise control is pretty standard on cars these days and lane keep is available in many high-end German cars. Audi has a quite advanced Level2 option though it's a bit limited. Nissan ProPilot will be on par with Tesla in the new Skyline. I've also heard good things about Ford's latest lane keep.

Not entirely fair to dismiss some other solutions on the grounds that those companies work on a more stable and safe implementation and/or have different product strategy and lifecycle. I've tested Openpilot in Europe and Japan and doesn't work well, would never use it apart from short tests. I've only had a chance to drive a non-autopilot Tesla so no experience but based on reports, it works quite bad in left-hand-traffic countries.

Some companies have some great stuff in certain areas some have in others and some are somewhat behind. OTA is really dangerous tech and I know for a fact there are at least 2 Japanese manufacturers working on it and one of them might be in products next year (though I doubt).

Also, not sure what you expect with Waymo meaningfully changing people's lives.

Both of those, and the cases of Tesla owners sleeping could be fixed with visual driver monitoring systems like what OpenPilot has as well as SuperCruise. Also, we aren't comparing this equally to a sample of humans driving manually, and how many of them don't pay attention or watch TV while driving.

&gt; The saving factor is that teams don't improve at a linear pace. As they get more experienced, they get better at getting better.

Electric motors and single gear transmissions are easy.  Those are by far the simplest parts in a Tesla.   Batteries are the challenge, and the legacy companies don't seem to have their own gigafactory making batteries like Tesla does.   When Musk claimed that no one has produced an EV that is good as the 2012 Model S he was right.

If the fleet company can somehow use on site solar to charge them the cot drops to like 1 cent per mile.   Gasoline in California, 35 miles at $3.50 (and it goes well over 4 sometimes) is 10 cents per mile.

251,Cunninghams_right,"even Uber and Lyft have reduced subway ridership in NYC and increased congestion. a cheaper version will likely continue that trend.

&amp;#x200B;

vehicle lifecycle cost for an electric car and a train are roughly equal when you have 4-5 passengers in the electric car. so, if all of the self-driving taxis are single occupancy, then they will be more wasteful.

&amp;#x200B;

most of their criticisms are at least partly valid as long as the self-driving taxis are single occupancy and operate on the surface streets. that's why I'm a huge fan of The Boring Company's Loop system (not to be confused with hyperloop). they want to use 8-16 passenger vehicles (greener/cheaper than a train), dig inexpensive tunnels so you can build more routes than a subway or even surface rail, group people by destination so that you don't have to stop pods at every stop (which would put average speed above any subway/LRT/bus), and have the ability to serve the ""last mile"" by exiting the tunnel via elevator or ramp to drop people off like a shuttle bus, but also drop people at stations like a subway. that is basically the best of all worlds. it would be faster than driving or taking a train, it would cost less, could be door-to-door like a taxi (though, not quite as good because you have to drop off all 8-16 people), or run surface fixed-routes like a bus.

I think Loop is the logical conclusion if you really think hard about the subject.

* how do you avoid surface congestion? tunnels.
* why don't people like existing tunnel transit? it's expensive to build and averages 25-35mph.
* can it be cheaper and faster? yes, build a smaller diameter tunnel with no electrified rails at 1/5th the cost (actual cost today), and use on/off ramps so everyone does not have to stop at every station (now average speed went from 30mph to 100mph).
* wouldn't self-driving cars in a tunnel be more expensive/wasteful? not if you group 5+ passengers
* wouldn't a train carry more people? all but a handful of subway lines in the US carry more people than highway-density 8-passenger vehicles, and 16 passenger vehicles would be able to cover any transit line in the us. moreover, places with high enough demand could build a 2nd or 3rd tunnel, since each tunnel is \~1/5th of a subway line.
* wouldn't people still want to take a taxi for the first/last mile? the vehicles can leave the tunnel for first/last mile service when the self-driving tech gets good enough.
* wouldn't all of those mini-buses be a lot of traffic? you also let people out at stations like a subway
* wouldn't that require Tesla to develop true self-driving tech? they could operate like a subway without that, since tunnel driving would be so easy, and they also said they would allow other company's self-driving vehicles.

&amp;#x200B;

setting the Loop concept aside for a minute, most cities would benefit from 2-3 group taxis/minibuses. even if train ridership goes down, if you can get 2-3 groups to pool into a shuttle/taxi, then you will likely have a net decrease in traffic. I imagine a minibus type thing, but with a front, middle, and rear compartment. that way, you would get riders who don't want to share transit with strangers (women often don't feel comfortable on public transit) which would pull more people out of cars and take up less road space, reducing traffic.",1567053540,eyfr8d1,t3_cwqs7a,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

Long term, I think we'll see all of it transformed.

Mass transit will look more like dedicated lane self driving busses or small set of train cars. Personnel would likely only be needed for security, clean up and maintenance.

Self driving pool vans moving people via HOV lanes. Lanes possibly automatically shared with busses, in a subordinate fashion, giving higher capacity vehicles priority.


Much smaller last mile vehicles for small occupancy local transit to and from stations, stops, and dynamic transition points.

And finally more traditional self driving vehicles, for regional trips for family, the elderly, handicapped, and wealthy (I expect a hefty tax on these vehicle miles + specialty subsidies). I've got some doubt about this guess.

I assume much of that based on a lane restricted, capacity based restraint setup. If that means everything other street in a city is HOV, I expect it to happen. If that means some vehicles types are restricted, or licensed, I wouldn't be surprised.

356,WeldAE,"&gt; I'm in California and our electric gird is already at capacity.

The problem California has isn't as much down to capacity as it is to quality.  This isn't just making fun of CA, but a real metric used when describing power generators.  Things like wind and solar are considered poor quality, not because there is anything wrong with the electricity they generate, but because they can't be relied on to supply a certain capacity 24/7/365.  If the sun isn't shining you will get less from a solar farm than if it's a clear summer day.

California boxed itself in by over aggressively pushing for renewable electric sources while at the same time aggressively shutting down good base sources like nuclear power plants.  On top of this, the grid is so poorly maintained in CA that they have caused a lot of fires in the last couple of year, notable the camp fire.  Because of this they will shut down large transmission lines causing rolling blackouts to reduce fire risks.

So EVs or no EVs, the grid in CA is going to be highly unreliable.  Not because they lack capacity, but because they can't match demand easily because of low quality sources and lack of transmission lines during dry weather.

EVs will not make this situation worse because they all charge at off peak times.  In fact, they will make it better by allowing CA to keep more plants online at any given time and able to jump in when they have quality or weather problems.  There is no capacity problem in CA between 11pm and 6am, even on a hot dry summer night with no wind.

&gt; The fast chargers are not 500 dollars.

Yes they are, you are thinking of ""super chargers"".  It's a marketing thing so don't sweat it, it's confusing.  The $500 ones are called fast chargers or destination chargers.  They give you about 12kW per hour of charging.  The Super chargers give you 60kW to 150kW depending on your car and the specific station.  Thanks for the link, I hadn't read about the costs of those stations before and it was a good read.

The super chargers are if you are going long distance, just got through driving 250 to 300 miles and need to drive more.  They will get you going again with a near full charge in 30-45 minutes.  The fast chargers would take a 2-4 hours to do a full charge.  Pushing electricity slowly into Li-ion batteries helps them last longer so the fleets will NOT be super charging their fleets.

It isn't that different to the Autonomy Day presentation...

My view is ""feature complete"" mean they have identified all of the tasks needed for FSD and the NN has done some training on the image recognition needed for each task..

After  ""feature complete""  it is mostly a matter of more training, and more training data.

Project Dojo may be able accelerate some part of the training process...

My understanding is:-

1. New version of the NN is trained via the process you outlined.
2. The new version of the NN is deployed to the fleet (progressively)
3. New version of the NN runs in the fleet (in shadow mode on cars not using FSD)
4. Interventions on this version of the NN are automatically recorded and sent to Tesla.

3. &amp; 4. are where Tesla has a edge compared to the competition, as you point out for 1. Tesla can't train their NN any better than the competition, except for the fact that they have better training data.

But Karpathy knows as much about training NNs as anyone,

It could be I'm still missing the point you are making, I'm not claim Tesla is in the lead, simply that they are not far behind and can improve faster than the competition.

There's a lot to running a human-driven taxi service that would be a distraction for Google and the synergy is fairly low - if Google offers a superior but geo-limited service it's not hard to check that first before taking an Uber/Lyft and I doubt drivers are very happy to drive for a company that very explicitly wants to get rid of them. 

The only way I could see this happening is if they end up having trouble areas causing their coverage to be too spotty, like we can cover the suburbs but need humans in the city center. I find it far more likely they'll offer Uber/Lyft a cut to send rides within their geo-fenced area their way, they're bleeding money and probably not too hard to convince, while expanding their own brand as a pure SDC service.

I don't think Waymo cares that much about break-even, what they need is a service that actually works without a safety driver - everything else has the potential for optimization but without it you're stuck at 1 person/car. Even if in the beginning the running cost of the hardware, maintenance, repair, cleaning, dispatch service etc. exceed the traditional driver I think they'd be ready to scale up once they clear that hurdle.

Remember they have the Alphabet group at their back, they have virtually unlimited amounts of money if you can just make the business case for it. More or less taking over the transport industry is a ridiculously big prize, technology, sensors and their AI will improve and get cheaper and more reliable and cost less in huge volume - think millions of cars.

Like I said we won’t know until the drivers are pulled.  Reviews are such an imprecise measurement because something like a one minute shorter wait time could raise the rating by 25%, while almost veering into a car may only lower a rating by 10%.

Obviously, the biggest divide is between problems you can launch with and problems you can't. Anything grouped into safety is clearly in the later category, However, from the reporting these seemed like a minority, parking and drop off issues can be improved after launch. 

If you get a safety issue, you need to look at the ride data, see how it played out, did the driver take control, should they have, was it really a safety problem, or was  perception of safety the problem. Perhaps the car reacted well but the human didn't like it, perhaps the car should have reacted differently, even if it avoided the problem. You can't assume there is an issue just because one was reported. 

If there are 30% of riders having problems, and only a minority are having safety problems, and only some of those  problems are real. The article might be right. 

Two corollaries from this. First the difference between SF and AZ are really instructive about how well Waymo does in more complex environments. 

Second, no one is testing at Waymo's scale, and that the data they are getting from customers is really important and actionable. If your company isn't testing at this scale and collecting that data, you are really far from having a product. Waymo is creating the business processes necessary to run a service like this, they are creating the pipeline to solve problems at scale. The next step for Waymo will be to operate a mixed service, sometimes giving people a car with no backup, and other times using a backup driver. They will use software to super-geo-fence the no back up drivers. Very restricted routes and times, but they will grow that area, and scale the service.  When the mixed service generates enough revenue to cover marginal costs, they'll open a service in a second city. At that point we are in a value engineering phase. Each improvement to the software makes it more autonomous and cheaper to run, each improvement that makes hardware cheaper to build and operate makes things more profitable.

It still amazes me how many people don't realize how expensive parking is.  It amazes me even more how many people want to argue that parking is cheap and easy to build.

&gt; But if parking was replaced with a loading/unloading system for SDC cars these mega residential towers now become viable...

This is what worries me the most right now.  I have seen zero thought from architects and urban designers about what such a system would look like.  This isn't a small part of the problem, it is the problem.  I was really expecting large venues like Airports to solve this by now with most passengers being picked up and dropped off.  Instead airports are just slowly blinking in confusion as ride sharing is stealing 20% of the passengers from their garages and air travel is up another 20% and their drop off and pickup lines are log jams.

There answer so far has been to treat ride share like a problem and shunt it to far flung parking lots.  This is only going to get worse and they have to figure out a solution.  Airports don't even see massive surges like stadiums and buildings do.

&gt;  City planners can figure out some effective way to minimize the roads car use while optimizing their pickup/drop off points

For cities I think this is pretty easy.  They must reclaim all the free parking they are currently giving away.  I don't even think this will be a hard problem outside a few cities like NYC and Chicago.  I think NYC only meters like 10% of their parking today.

The other thought is to go back to on-way streets.  I've been toying with this idea for a while so I could still be wrong, but all the reasons one-way streets are bad today doesn't apply to SDCs.

466,yakri,"This is a very silly way to think about it.

Lots of standards in electronics are maintained for decades. Really we've only seen some of the worst insanity lately with usb and it's five trillion seven hundred billion one hundred and forty two million versions that exist for literally no good reason.

and heck, that shit is largely backwards compatible.

Bios updates for motherboards have a short shelf life because by and large, no one fucking wants to update the bios, and you're expected to write a bios that works to begin with, but with maybe some nice performance improvements in 1-2 future patches.

Now let's look at operating systems, something ACTUALLY comparable a little bit.

Windows 7 is being phased out with 11ish years of support, which is about the longest you can actually expect the hardware to last.

So it's fair to say 10 years of software support is perfectly reasonable. Especially if we're talking the latter 5-8 being low level maintenance as after all no improvements are actually necessary to maintain the operational life of the platform.

As for actually producing components, this is little different than any other car parts. Ideally companies would be forced by law to continue producing components for repairs for X years to ensure cars can last up to 30 years although you might need used parts for the last 10. Maybe mandate the designs for the originals be public domain after that long too. I mean good fucking luck getting past the lobbyists, but that would be the smart thing to do.

However fortunately there's no real need to maintain production or support of the original parts, as you can produce a refresh that uses the same connections and totally different hardware/software with backwards compatibility, as we are after all just talking about a computer parts upgrade. As long as you have a good standard, at least within each manufacturer, it would be easy to make upgrading this a relatively easy swap. Might still run you a couple grand but you could just keep using the original part for 10+ years instead if you want and it doesn't die on you.

Really there's nothing new here, cars already have long lasting extensive computer systems. Compared to actually building a self driving car, this is a pretty trivial issue.

If we don't see similarly long lifespans in self driving cars to modern cars (20+ years) it will 100% be because of planned obsolescence. Possibly a preemptive move to try and milk more profits out of a product that ought to actually survive to its intended lifespan more reliably.",1566849308,ey67py2,t1_ey64a3s,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

497,WeldAE,"&gt; The key point to make it a reality is to demonstrate that the inefficiencies of solutions today are vast.  Today if you look at San Francisco that has around I think, throw out a number, 50k registered ride hailing drivers; where you can measure that it requires only 1k to 2k at peak hours.  That point should be the driver of thought of the thought leadership.

Not sure this is an apples-to-apples comparison but it is interesting.  You might have 50k registered drivers but at any given time a small minority are actually driving.  I know people who only drive one day per week almost as a hobby.  For the other side, my guess is he is talking about in a perfectly coordinated system, you could handle the transit of SF with only 1k to 2k cars and pooling.  This sounds reasonable based on numbers  I've read about for NYC.  

However, [looking at page 8 of this document](https://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/reports-and-documents/2019/01/sfmta_mobility_trends_report_2018.pdf) shows that Transportation Network Companies, TNCs, and Taxis make 185k intra-city trips per day and represent 16% of the 1.13m trips.  Another 450k trips enter the city and I have to assume another 450 leave each day.  That puts the total volume of trips at basically 2m/day.

The same document says the average trip length is 6 miles which would allow a single SDC to do ~40 trips/day.  At only 2k SDCs, this would require each SDC to carry 25 people per trip.

511,rileyoneill,"Renting parking in a major city can cost you thousands of dollars per year.  There is a service called Spacer which allows you to rent unused parking space, in San Francisco the norm seems to be $300 per month.  I actually know someone who had to do this several years ago where he rented a parking space 5-6 houses down from where he lived for $300 per month, they were telling me that some people had to pay $300 for their parking at home and another $300 to park nearby work.  $600 per month just to park your car.   This is a flat $3600-$7200 per year to the cost of driving, which will also include parking in commercial districts which can easily be $10-$20 per pop.    


I actually think that in San Francisco it will be cheaper to get around via the SDC taxi than it will be to park.

513,rileyoneill,"If this technology works, and I think it will work, cities are going to radically transform in their design. Cities, especially big cities, real estate in downtown comes at an extreme premium.  Real estate being used for parking is a sub optimal use of space.  Communities like San Francisco, housing costs well over $1000 per square foot and having a 900 square foot garage is NOT having $900k of more living space.    


Tall residential buildings are also dependent on parking.  If you want to build an 70 floor sky scraper in Los Angeles, it may house 1300 people, which would mean today it would need 1300 parking spaces nearby.  So the project may be a total no-go right now because the parking jacks up the cost and people will not pay the premium prices if they can not park at home.  This parking requirement is a major restriction on building dense housing.   But if parking was replaced with a loading/unloading system for SDC cars these mega residential towers now become viable and can actually be placed relatively close to each other with parks in between them.   This could also juice up the ridership on existing grade separated mass transit.   Not in the 2020s, but I can see the 2030s a lot of cities completely razing mid density blocks and replacing them with mega towers and allowing population density to go up 10 fold.  At these population densities things like monorails and expanding the subway system become much more viable and much more politically popular.    


According to Tony Seba, the amount of land used in Los Angeles for parking is the equivalent to 3 San Franciscos.  This means that if the parking lots in Los Angeles were repurposed to urban development the city could house 3 million additional people.  This could also allow for more green space, more mixed use space.  Greater pedestrian areas.  I actually think a lot of streets will become pedestrian malls vs car traffic.  City planners can figure out some effective way to minimize the roads car use while optimizing their pickup/drop off points and enabling a much faster flow of traffic.   People actually like really cool pedestrian zones.  Its why people pay a lot of money to go to Disneyland.  We are social animal and we like the idea of going downstairs and then walking around, seeing people, and doing enjoyable activities.  I can also envision major cities having separate pedestrian bridges in downtown areas so the people and cars never cross.    


  
How will this affect commuters?  People typically hate shitty commutes.  A shitty commute means you have to wake up an hour or more earlier.  A shitty commute means you 'work' 470 hours a year that you don't get paid extra.  A shitty commute means you spend money to get to work.   Being far removed from the urban area, your shitty commute may also mean that you live far away from other amenities.  The good restaurants may also be an hour away.  The cool parks may be an hour away.  Your friends may be an hour away.   The good doctors may be an hour away.   There are many other advantages to living in the city other than a shorter commute time.   Look at cities like San Francisco and New York.

515,WeldAE,"&gt; although of course technologically it shouldn't be that complicated

I disagree with this.  You have to track, very precisely, the location of every car approaching an intersection.  At 80mph that is 120 feet per second.  If you want to interleave cars with a 20 foot buffer, you have to have a max latency of 150ms to locate and transmit to all other cars.  In reality, you would want to ensure a max latency of 50ms.  What happens if some car is lagging and only getting updates every 300ms?  How does it even know it's lagging?  Will it figure it out in time?  So many questions and I haven't even thought about the problem space very much.

&gt; we're going to start out with a drop of SDCs in an ocean of HDCs

I'm not so much disagreeing here, as you are almost certainly correct they will start out with small numbers.  They may even increase slowly for a long time.  But that is really beside the point and isn't what we are discussing here.  The question will it be a long tail of rollouts or a cliff?  So it isn't so much how it starts as how it ends.  In the long tail case, you point holds.  If it's a cliff then presumably we could change how intersections should work.

Because SDCs will not be in shortage, they won't be able to put more than 250 miles/day on the car.

&gt; Unless the charge times get as good as gasoline and the range get as good as gasoline, we will just continue to use gasoline powered cars.

This simply isn't true.  There is no need for cars with 400 miles of range.  10 minutes filling up with gas Vs. 30 minutes charging is trivial and will not be what picks the drive train of EVs it will be per mile cost.

OP is right that pulling over is often not an option. If you're just off the side of the highway in 0 vis weather, you'll just get rear-ended. Or it'll keep snowing and you'll die in the cold. -35 for 48 hours sucks unless your car is well stocked.

Do plan to leave people stranded in Waymos all over a city for hours? Do they plan to shut down service proactively on days where rain/snow is predicted so they don't leave people stuck at their destinations, unable to get back home?

580,WeldAE,"I remain dubious of the synchronized intersection.  

The obvious problem is you can't have manual cars.  In order for them to be even remotely viable, most cars would have to be autonomous.  Even then, even a small number of manual cars will cause havoc with the system and defeat the purpose of it completely.  It wwould be like having police running around with their lights on all the time and snarling up the intersections.  If such intersections were implemented, public pressure would kill off all manual cars quickly out of spite if nothing else.

So lets say everything is autonomous.  Next comes the concept of bandwidth Vs. latency.  The same way engineers say fast, cheap, good; pick two.  You can either optimize for bandwidth or latency.  Today cars and intersections have no hope of optimizing for latency so they choose bandwidth and push as many cars through as possible and only keep latency down to the point that drivers don't start running red lights out of frustration.  When most people think of synchronous intersections, they think of cars flowing smoothly by from all directions perfectly timed to slide through the gaps and not hitting anyone.  

This is possible, but only if the roads making up the intersections are lightly used.  At a certain amount of traffic, a synchronous intersection needs to convert to something much closer to what a policeman would do if they were running the intersection.  This optimizes for bandwidth.  In the end, if you use an intelligent controller even in the low usage situation, you have the same effect as a syncronous intersection, but one that can also be used by manual cars.

I'm not saying put a policeman on a box in the middle of each intersection.  I'm suggesting updating the light controller to once that can ""see"" the traffic and direct traffic through the intersection intelligently.  Let the cars be aware of all the other cars on the road and they can plan their arrival at the intersection in such a way that the intelligent control will be able to let them through.  This is uncoordinated cooperation between the car and the light controller so there are no security concerns.  The car knows that if they go 35mph until the intersection, they will be the only car at the intersection at the time and the light controller will be green for them since why wouldn't it given the state of the intersection.  Even if there were rouge manual cars, the wait would be minimal.",1566625402,exwuo8j,t3_cufu9k,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

582,WeldAE,"&gt; They will be fueled by good old fashioned gasoline.

I disagree since gasoline cars would cost way more per mile than an EV.  The most important factor is cost per mile and it overrules everything else.

&gt; Shared cars need long range

It's possible, but there is certainly room for debate there.  There was a good discussion a while back about what the ideal range of an EV was for fleet service.  Of course a lot hinges on the cost of batteries, but even holding that constant at today's high costs, it wasn't clear if a lot of distributed chargers with short ranged cars was better/worse than large centralized charging with long range cars.

In the end the range wasn't the issue, it was the lifetime of the battery that was the major concern.  If you take a modern 75kWh car that gets 300 miles of range, this is cut down to 180 miles to protect the battery if you want the car to last 1m miles to total service.  This isn't enough range to get through an entire 250 mile day so you either increase the battery to 100kWh or you distribute the chargers and charge every car 2x per day.

Charging only takes 30 minutes to get from 20% to 80% so charge time isn't a huge issue. Unlike gasoline, another charger is just another parking space.  They don't need the separation between pumps that gasoline needs.  There is a cost per charger, but it's pretty low compared to a gas pump especially if you consider real estate costs. Charging once 2x per day is also not a huge issue since you can charge overnight and between 10am-12pm and 1pm-4pm when you have spare cars outside of rush hour and lunch.",1566623402,exwqqgk,t1_ext16nw,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

590,boonhet,"On a model by model comparison, maybe. E.g just comparing S class to Model S, the Model S has a slight advantage, at least in the US.

Things to consider, though: Each of the 3 German manufacturers have multiple models, most of them relatively high-end (even a 3 series can be configured pretty luxurious, but anything above 3/C/A4 is out of this discussion, they're not really that ""premium""). Hell, each of them has at least 5 SUV models alone. Also, China is massive market for long wheel base versions of German executive cars. The amount of LWB 5 series BMWs sold in China per year is about close to the amount of regular 5 series BMWs sold in the EU AND the US per year. Tesla is a long way from those numbers in China, although it is catching up.

A bit of anecdotal evidence (absolutely non-conclusive) about Tesla's market share: I've seen 1 Tesla Model 3 in my corner of the EU. It had foreign plates. Over the years, I've seen a whopping 10 Teslas, approximately. Unless there have been repeat sightings, of course. I see new (2017+) German sedans every week at the very least. There's also an 8 series somewhere in my city + a pretty recent i8 parked 200 meters from me.

&amp;#x200B;

Re lack of physical buttons in newer German cars: Yeah, that's true. They still do have the essential buttons though, and I'm fine with having to control SOME things through a touch screen (navigation, for example - you don't really NEED to do it while driving). Still, even with touch screens in these cars, I still think they're better done than on Tesla. The giant slab in the center just looks so much like an afterthought. IMO, a W213 E class interior looks and feels a lot more premium than any Tesla model. And it's cheaper than a Model 3 here in the EU, as far as I know.

663,rileyoneill,"I see TAAS as mass transit.  That 2 hour ordeal I told you about I had to do back in 05 or so, I was frequently one of two people on the bus.  I think they have canceled the line by now.  Modern American cities were not designed around mass transit and designing a mass transit solution to make them work is impractical, expensive and won't work very well.  TAAS is that solution, even if it is privately owned and operated.   Unless people live and work along a main line, the process just involves them waiting around a lot for transfers.  The system can be improved, and likely has been improved since I had to use it (I think they canceled some routes, but still from the house I lived in to the campus was about 2 hours each way while they were less than a 15 mile drive apart).    Its probably a $20-$25 Lyft ride.  Why the college chose to split up their classes so students had to go to multiple campuses that were all 15-20 miles apart was beyond retarded though.   The goal should first and foremost be to eliminate trips in the first place.  

Cities are going to transform because it will be advantageous to do so.   In Los Angeles one of the biggest uses of land is parking lots.  Despite land frequently being more valuable than the house on the land, bare land is used for parking lots.  Car owners frequently have to rent parking spaces at hundreds of dollars per month (I have a friend who had to do this up in San Francisco, this was 6 years ago and he was paying $400 per month for a single car in garage space that was a block away from his house (he was prohibited from storing anything but a car, no boxes or tools or anything).   Any new massive high rise building would immediately fill up.  Especially if downstairs was full of amenities and it was in a pedestrian area that had quick access to a pickup/dropoff that could accommodate hundreds of cars per hour. 

I think this is going to hardest hit the communities out west and a few back east where space is an issue and driving has a bunch of costs associated with it which are not such a problem in the midwest.  In the midwest people are more spread out, the weather can be brutal 2-3 months out of the year.   

I do think that commercial service is going to launch in some communities in 2021 or 2022.  Waymo 'sort' of already has this going in Arizona right now.  They are expanding in California, which I really think is the best place for them as the weather is ideal and the roads and freeways are vast.  

Another issue people are not bringing up is the idea of a feedback cycle with respect to new car sales.   Lets say TAAS works reasonably well in Southern California to where Southern California residents do not need a car to get around and thus can sell off their cars.    Those existing cars will pretty much all leave the area.  Even if only half of the people here sell their cars for TAAS, that would be 10M cars flooding the used market all at once.  New car sales in California are going to suffer, but those 10m cars will flood the rest of the country affecting new car sales as well.  Folks seem to think that TAAS will only be disruptive if 80-90% of the population uses it, this is wrong, TAAS will start disrupting national markets if 50% of just some markets start using it (and sell their cars).   If 20% of the US population uses TAAS and gives up driving it will crash the car market.",1566500136,exqb2ny,t1_exmpqy6,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

* Tesla:  Had to sell cool looking consumer cars right now with the promise of FSD.  Can't do that with a big, expensive LIDAR.

* OpenPilot:  Their whole thing is to be a relatively cheap add on.  They had to integrate with existing cars to be the ""Android of cars"" as Hotz says.  Existing cars don't have big LIDARs.

* Mobileye:  They have stated clearly that they actually will have LIDAR when they move beyond driver assist.  They believe it is required.  So I don't necessarily count them in the ""cameras only"" column.

For the blind, elderly, disabled, low income, etc it will provide life changing freedom. I actually only own my bike because years ago my car died and I couldn't afford to fix it but I could afford a $200 Schwinn on Craigslist and I had to get to work. 

You've obviously experienced how inefficient and time consuming public transportation can be, but I think even that can become way better. Public transport would be great if you didn't have to find a way to the bus stop and then then to your final destination from the destination bus stop. Also, if you didn't have to operate according to the bus schedule.  I think autonomy will eventually shrink buses in size and transform them into point to point mass transit. Lyft already gives you the option to pick up other riders along the way for a cheaper fare. I'm sure Uber does this too. 

Imagine if buses did the same but with a dozen people. There would be no bus stops. No routes. No schedules. You'll call for an autonomous bus with the app and it finds the closest one that's headed in the same general direction as you. Smart algorithms constantly optimize riders with vehicles to minimize time, distance, and cost. Most people who can afford to will probably still get their own personal ride but it will give cities options for how to provide transportation for everyone at very little cost. 

As you said, gas stations and parking lots in large cities will be built upon right away because land is scarce. But I'm from a midwestern city where land is plentiful so there are parking lots everywhere. Google Earth view shows every big box store and mall has more parking space than building footprint. What becomes of this space? More Home Depots and Wal-Marts? Maybe parks? It's interesting to think about how cities will be transformed. I think sprawling cities will slow expansion for a while as they grow inward to fill in all of the new freed up space. 


It will be interesting to see how quick the transition happens. I think it will happen fast like smartphones. Not quite as fast because cars are way more expensive and don't turn over as quickly. 10-20 year range is when I think 90+ % (possibly 100%) of traffic will be autonomous.

728,rileyoneill,"Car ownership for low income people can be a massive economic drain and a source of considerable economic anxiety.  The car they need to own so they can go to work can cost them randomly a few thousand bucks should something go wrong.   TAAS will enable the lowest income people in society to have the same high quality transportation that NEW car ownership would offer them at a drastically lower, and predictable rate.   They will not need to save money to buy some used bucket of bolts or have to go into debt to fix their car.     Its pretty fucked when a person has to use 3-4 paychecks to fix their car and 2-3 paychecks to fuel it, and 2 paychecks to insure it.  For a low income person car ownership is a massive liability, but one they have to take on to get to their job.   For people who can't afford the car in the first place, finding work is drastically harder and the options they have at hand are typically not very great.   Many lower income folks in cities can't justify paying for parking in their own neighborhood and with this technology they will not have to.    Uber as is already goes 5x-6x as fast as the bus from door to door, and this does not take into consideration odd bus timing (such as the bus dropping you off at work 15 minutes after your boss wants you at work, resulting in you taking an earlier buss and waiting around for 45 minutes before you start) and if you have to take multiple buses Uber much faster than 6x as fast.   In 2005 I used to had to take two buses from my house to a college campus to take a course I needed (the college I normally attended was 1 mile from my house, in a neighborhood I grew up in).  This two bus system resulted in a 2 hour trip from my house to the classroom,  a trip which is normally a 20 minute drive.   Imagine if that was work, and an employee had leave 140 minutes early to get to work on time.   It also turned a 2 hour class into an all day 6+ hour ordeal.  And if I had to stay late to do something I would have to sit and wait for another hour for the next bus.   The daily pass was also $5 per day (I only needed it twice a week)  


For people in food deserts, or far removed from commercial, social, educational, and health services, TAAS will allow them to get to where ever they need to be at a drastically cheaper cost than any alternative.   Even if the government pays some monthly amount of their TAAS budget as  welfare program this will be far more empowering than whatever limited public transportation they may currently have.   They can take a job anywhere and know with confidence they can get to work every day regardless of where the job is in their community.   They won't have to go into major debt or take on a major responsibility.    


  
This service will allow rural people, people who are far removed from airports and transportation hubs to get to their longer range destination by a sleeper car showing up directly to the home at say 8pm, and then driving for 13-14 hours while the rider watches TV and sleeps to take them to their destination the following morning that is 700 miles away.   They can wake up refreshed and get anywhere they want to go.  


Being lost will be a thing of the past. Pretty much anywhere you are you will just summon a ride to take you home.   You can go to a city you have never been to, perhaps even a city in a foreign country where they do not even speak English, and immediately summon a ride, which communicates to you in English, and takes you exactly to where you need to be.    


For the United States in particular, the shift to TAAS will completely redesign our cities.   I am convinced the adoption of TAAS will be finished by 2030, but the building of buildings to accommodate this new change will still take a while.  But in some cities will happen very quickly as real estate is in an extreme pinch and during a 2 acre parking lot into a 50 floor building will make some investors a lot of money.    


2040 will look extremely different.   American cities will look different.   There will be much more high rise buildings as parking will not be a limiting factor.  There will be much more green space within the cities.  Loading zones will be everywhere, but fleet charging will mostly be out of site.  Parking lots will mostly not exist.   Areas will become more pedestrian friendly and some places could remove roads to make a more Disney park like feel with TAAS cars in specific service areas.   2040 will look like the future.    


  
Most gas engine cars will end up off the road.  They may be used for private recreation on private roads and some public roads certain times of the day.  But most will end up as collector's items, or in museums to 20th and 21st Century artifacts.  Your typical ICE car will have a negative value, you will have to pay someone to take it off your hands.   It will be like getting rid of an old mattress, no one will want it.    Car maintenance and repair will still be a thing but car mechanics and their businesses as we know them will die out.   TAAS companies will have in house service or contract all their service out to specialists.  No more consumer to Mechanic relationship.  Engine mechanics will probably shrink 10 fold between now and 2030.     When the majority of people no longer own ICE cars, and I don't mean everyone, just the majority, more than half, we will see the politics change drastically regarding cars.  No longer will parking be a major political priority.  No longer will gas taxes be unpopular.  I could definitely see more cities banning ICE cars, especially older cars and diesels, from city centers (that one is already happening in Europe).    The majority of people who don't use gasoline will see no problem drastically raising a gas tax on the minority who do.  When it goes to the polls people will vote to fuck gasoline.   Driving a gas powered car 10 years from now could be a very weird thing to do and much more limiting than it is now, you could find parking in the city to be difficult and gasoline taxes making gas extremely expensive and then some places you are just now allowed to be.    


Gas stations will disappear.  Especially within the city where there will be several gas stations within a short distance of each other.  There will be a lot of issue about environmental contamination from their tanks leaking.  I know a geologist who worked in this area and he claimed it was always going to be big problem of the future.   But because the land is so valuable, it will get cleaned up and the gas stations will be repurposed into something else, in denser areas this will most likely be a tallish building with commercial services at the bottom and residential on top.",1566415252,exllzad,t3_cssxnl,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

If it needs data fast, it needs data fast, there aren't all that many ways to get around that...), and even Google's TPUs use crazy high-speed un-checked memory because of that.


Nvidia does have parity, but keep in mind that none of this done in a vacuum. You are probably right that you could design a system that was doubly-redundant AND uses ECC or checked memory with no perf penalty, but that ends up costing a lot more. I believe part of the reason why they went down this path was that they could get better performance than what Nvidia could offer (at least at the time) for a fraction of the cost.


Doubling everything provides more than enough redundancy and still comes in under cost compared to the Nvidia-based systems they were using. Nvidia's costs might be different for their architecture, so for them ECC might be the better choice.

762,WeldAE,"&gt; Are you saying that SDC taxi is not a robotaxi?

I'm making no statement about what a robotaxi is as I don't use that term.  I said ""SDC taxi"" to make sure it was clear this was a shared fleet vehicle and not a personally owned SDC.

&gt; What does self-driving have to do with EV?

Because ICE cars aren't really viable SDC Taxis vehicles.  You can use them for testing but they are a poor choice for a fleet at scale.  At scale the SDCs won't be in constant operation during their shift and will probably idle waiting on rides 7 hours, drive 7 hours and be parked 10 hours in a given day.  

Police cars have the same problem and a police car is retired after about 100k miles because at that point it has 250k engine miles.  EVs don't have this problem and can maintain climate and electronics using about 10 miles/hour of charge.  So the 1m miles billable lifetime of an EV compares to only 100k mile on an ICE car.  Today it doesn't even appear a standard ICE car works at all and they have to use Hybrids just to run the electronic overhead needed.  All Hybrids on the market don't have enough power to maintain the climate so they also have to run their engine.

Waymo is doing it because they have no choice at the moment and have used the closest fit the market has to offer.  They are running a 7 passenger Hybrid Van that can only carry 3 adults and 1 kid and a full EV crossover that can only carry 2 adults.  I'd say these are extremely poor SDC fleet cars.

&gt; If electric vehicles become technically and economically viable

788,WeldAE,"&gt; What kind of car do you need for a robotaxi?

Above all it needs to be an EV.  There are several companies that make EVs today but not many.  In a year or two there will be a lot more but today this requirement alone limits the options to less than probably 10 vehicles.

Next it needs to have reasonable range.  Maybe 3 cars are EVs with reasonable range today.  Again, this could change in the next few years but this seems less likely as no one other than Tesla today makes a car with reasonable range.  Another option is that charging infrastructure could become more widespread allowing cars with less range to be viable, but again this doesn't seem likely outside Tesla for many years.

The car needs to be built for a long duty cycle to be commercially viable.  Only Tesla has any claims to build cars for high mileage use and only Tesla has any cars with high mileage.  While it's possible a few other cars can do high mileage, but given the size of their batteries, this is highly unlikely since this is the prime wear part on the car.

Finally and most important, the car needs to be able to transport a reasonable number of people.  Most Uber/Lyft cars all have the ability to transport, at a minimum, 4 adult passengers in addition to the driver.  Because of issues around the steering wheel, child seats, etc, most existing cars pressed into use as SDC would only be able to transport 3 people and some like the i-Pace only hold 2.

The automation issue is more about the potential threat of rapid and widespread displacement. Typically, displacement happens very slowly over time, allowing for markets, legislation, and expectations, to find new uses for the displaced labor. Usually this is a good thing. It means that a skilled person no longer has to focus their efforts on something they are more qualified for. 

The issue is that automation may come TOO fast and too hard. That the economy wont adapt, and that the rapid increase in automation will outpace our economy's ability to adapt. This is a genuine fear. But in the case of the article, it's a non-issue, and provides a net-benefit for everyone. We should have robots performing menial unskilled tasks, like bringing food from one location to another. Humans shouldn't do that if they don't need to. 

In fact, my fears have been really diminished over automation recently. I do see it as a HUGE threat for the uneducated poor -- that's going to trigger some unrest, but for the general population, I don't think it'll be too much of a threat. One of the leaders working on AI at Google said the threat is overestimated, that things like automation and AI are much harder than the general population thinks. That most people see AI as something that is similar to ""Moore's Law"", allowing for exponential growth. But it's not. The last 10% is harder than the first 90% with things like this.

843,CallMeOatmeal,"&gt;When Jessica Robinson moved to Detroit from San Francisco five years ago, she sold her car. 

&gt;“When I moved here it was a huge quality of life choice. I walk to work, I bicycle, I have a Vespa that I ride around. I was able to buy my first home here, which I never would have been able to do in the Bay Area,” she says. 

&gt;Robinson’s organisation, the Detroit Mobility Lab, aims to tempt tech talent towards Michigan. Its office is in a downtown WeWork, a trendy office with the Silicon Valley company’s trademark glass booths and shared working spaces. Here, taxi app giant Lyft has an outpost, as does Bosch, as well as many smaller startups.

&gt;The Motor City is changing. Once synonymous with decline, poverty and crime, it is now home to hipster hotels, a buzzy restaurant scene and a slew of startups working on self-driving cars, air taxis and the tech that powers them. Electric scooters dot the pavements and it has a shared bicycle scheme, shiny new buses and a freshly-launched transit mobile app. 

&gt;Self-driving vehicles from at least three companies, Waymo, Ford, and May Mobility, trundle through the streets. And startups are coming from all over the world, including the UK, in the hope of partnering with the big American car companies that are headquartered here and creating a workforce with the engineering and manufacturing expertise they need. 

&gt;Valerie Sathe Brugeman, of independent nonprofit the Center for Automotive Research, based in nearby Ann Arbor, says Detroit is undoubtedly on the up. “We are well on our way into the revival. Irrespective of everything that's happening on the self driving and advanced transportation technologies front, Detroit was already coming back,” she says. 

&gt;“Because there's been a buzz about Detroit for years now, I think the automakers and other entities are realising: ‘we have Detroit right in our backyard. We ought to be doing more here’.”

&gt;Ford, the company which 100 years ago made Detroit the centre of the automotive world, is once again overhauling the Motor City. Last year it got a $208.8m tax break to buy and redevelop vast swathes of property including the abandoned Michigan Central Station, which last saw an Amtrak train in 1988. 

&gt;The city declared bankruptcy in 2013, brought low by mismanagement, overstaffed public services, a huge public sector pensions bill, endemic borrowing, population decline and falling tax revenues. 

&gt;Its debts mounted to $18 billion, its murder rate was the highest in the US, and its population had plummeted from more than a million in 1990 to less than 700,000 in 2013. During the spring of 2009, at the height of the financial crisis, General Motors and Chrysler, two of the city’s biggest employers, both declared bankruptcy.

&gt;Since then, a combination of a buoyant national economy, public incentives and private investment has prompted a revival. 

&gt;Near Ford’s new 1.2m square foot development in Corktown, the millennials are moving in. Along the main road, trendy wine bars and noodle restaurants sit beside garages and warehouses. A shiny new block of flats is under construction.

&gt;Its pretty residential streets, just a few hundred from the husk of the still-decrepit train station and busy Michigan Avenue, are well-kept, though there is still the odd empty plot or boarded-up building. 

&gt;Nancy Moncivais, 59, who has lived in the area for more than 30 years, said it was “about time” Ford invested in the neighbourhood. She and her husband paid $35,000 for their home in 1986, and recent events have made that a very good investment. “You can’t keep a house around here. People work for Quicken Loans, they work for Ford, they work downtown.” 

&gt;Sherif Marakby, president and CEO of Ford Autonomous Vehicles, admits that the city can be a hard sell for workers from New York, California and Seattle who are familiar with the old stories about Detroit. “On the phone, it's more challenging than bringing them here. So we try we spend time on the phone to get people to come and visit, just come and see it for yourself.”

&gt;Around half of his staff working in the new autonomous vehicles are new to the industry, with less than a year working for the company, and half are veterans. Middle class families have historically elected to live in Detroit’s suburbs rather than in the city proper. The newbies are changing that, he says. “People that are coming from out of town, who don't have a place, a lot of them choose to live in the city. Many of them choose not to have a car,” he says. 

&gt;Ford is a 100-year-old manufacturing company trying to embrace Silicon Valley tech entrepreneurialism. Its self-driving technology comes from Pittsburgh startup Argo AI, and its vision for autonomous cars involves offering its services to third party firms to help transport their staff, the platform business model that has made Uber into an (unprofitable) $70bn company.

&gt;To help speed this process it is doing a series of “culture offsites”, in the interests of helping Detroit thoroughness blend with Silicon Valley speed. These sound like very Californian occasions. 

&gt;“The entire autonomous space is a big bold bet, because we're spending a lot of money without revenue for a while,” he says. “We talk about winning. What does winning mean? Working with the cities? What are the enablers to make us win? We talk about all of these things in our culture offsite. We're spending four or five hours this afternoon just talking about that.”

&gt;Downtown, near the Detroit River, which separates the city from Canada, a pedestrianised square has been reclaimed from cars and is full of local workers on their lunch break and teenager zooming around on e-scooters. Across the street, an expensive health food shop opened just six weeks earlier. 

&gt;But Detroit is huge, around 140 square miles, and outside the very centre, signs of the city’s troubled past are apparent. Boarded-up houses, buildings entirely reclaimed by nature and empty plots still dot residential streets, interspersed with beautifully kept clapboard homes painted in bright colours. 

&gt;The city is still in the throes of layoffs, with contractors, who aren’t employees of the auto-makers but work for other companies to whom the work is outsourced, often the first to be hit. Both GM and Ford have laid off thousands from their factories, though some employees are offered work at another plant, which may be elsewhere in the country. Many jobs have been moved abroad, to China or Mexico.      

&gt;Into the fray comes Silicon Valley company Waymo, a Google spinoff widely considered to be the most advanced down the path of creating a viable self-driving car. Patrick Cadariu, its head of vehicle supply chain operations, says 400 new jobs will be created in its new factory, which Waymo will use to kit out electric Jaguar cars with its self-driving technology.

&gt;There’s no doubt that setting up shop in Detroit, the car-loving heart of a car-loving country, is also a good PR decision (though Cadariu says this wasn’t a consideration). A Detroit native, he discovered after the factory location was announced that his own great-grandfather worked in the same building, back in 1926.

&gt;""He was attracted to being here at that point in time because of the opportunities that this innovation created, and I'm back here after being gone for a long time, for similar reasons,"" he says.

&gt;“You've got this incredibly rich engineering, manufacturing tradition...I always wanted it to be here. That was my clear bias from day one.”

&gt;He says he wants the new  jobs to go to locals. “It's not about transferring or shuffling people around. It's about creating new jobs and creating new opportunities here, and having Detroiters and people from Michigan with the first shot at that.”

&gt;One interesting challenge for Waymo could be interacting with the powerful unions which negotiate on behalf of the local workforce, something it is unlikely to have encountered in Silicon Valley. Cadariu says it’s too early for the company to be engaging with that, and hints that it might not even have to. “The type of work we do, and even in our final assembly processes - it's very different from what you what you would expect from the traditional automotive OEM factory.”

&gt;Self-driving car companies want data, and Detroit is a haven because of the wide variety of streets - and behaviours - that are found here. On a ride downtown in one of Ford’s cars, fitted out with sensors developed by its Pittsburgh-based partner, startup Argo AI, we encounter roundabouts, one-way streets, illegally parked cars and pedestrians wandering into the middle of the road without the right of way. 

&gt;Waymo, too, has been testing its cars here, to assess their ability to handle snow, a bugbear for self-driving cars. The light beams emitted by Lidar, which allow cars to “see” the world around them reflect off snowflakes, rendering them ineffective. In Detroit, it typically snows 36 days out of the year, making it an ideal testing ground for overcoming the snow problem. Its low density also means it has less of a traffic problem than other US cities. 

&gt;But the only company actually putting the public in its cars is shuttle company May Mobility, which takes staff of property management firm Bedrock on a short 800m route around part of the downtown area.",1566322920,exi81gc,t3_cswbfg,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

You need locations for the actuators for steering, braking and accelerator, turn signals, etc. Modifying cars in a chop shop is not a long term sustainable business model. The whole system will have to be redesigned every year as the auto company changes their designs. A simple change of a mounting bracket, for instance, might cause a full redesign of the actuator package. It'd be a mess.

912,CallMeOatmeal,"&gt;Google's spin-off self-driving firm Waymo has said it won't build a self-driving car from the ground up again because it's a ""distraction"". 

&gt;Speaking as the company prepared to open a Detroit factory which will be used to fit Chrysler and Jaguar cars with its self-driving software, Patrick Cadariu, its head of vehicle supply chain operations, said making cars was ""really hard"". 

&gt;""Our goal is not to build cars. It's to build the world's most experienced driver. So that is our core business. There's other people that are very, very good at making cars, and they should do that, and we'd love to work with them,"" he said. 

&gt;The firm, which was first created as Google's self-driving car company in 2009, has established a taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, where it has also begun to operate some cars without back-up drivers. 

&gt;Most self-driving car companies are taking a similar approach, by fitting existing cars with self-driving technology, but one of Waymo's Silicon Valley rivals, Zoox, founded in 2014, plans to build its own cars from the ground up. 

&gt;Its co-founder Jesse Levinson has previously said that its approach ""makes a lot of sense"" because it can create a car specifically designed to be driverless. 

&gt;""We're actually solving kind of the entire problem holistically as one company,"" he told TechCrunch Mobility Sessions last month.

&gt;Mr Cadariu added: ""My worry with some players is what are their core competencies, what are their strengths, and are they focusing on solving the right problems, or are they being distracted? 

&gt;""We've been doing this for 10 years, and the industry itself is still in the very early days. We've been laser focused on very specific problems, and it's hard. So trying to do everything is probably not going to help you get there faster, safer.""

&gt;One of Waymo's early prototype vehicles was a small two-seater car named the Firefly, which it built itself, and retired in 2017. 

&gt;In a blog post announcing that decision, the company said; ""By designing and building a truly self-driving vehicle from scratch, we were able to crack some of the earliest self-driving puzzles — where to place the sensors, how to integrate the computer, what controls passengers need in a car that drives itself.""",1566228015,exexwus,t1_exet1d4,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

So the first way is to try to understand the flagger's signals.   However, only the first car needs to do that, because it will report up to HQ that the road is closed (or other special situation) and most other unmanned cars will use different routes, unless there is no other route.

They may use data networks and get help from a remote operations center, if the flagger needs to give complex instructions.

Ideally, the flagger will use an app on his or her phone to publish the location of the traffic problem and some basic facts about it.  So no unmanned car may ever encounter the flagger at all.    If there is no data signal, and nobody who has signal is aware of the problem, then it will have to wait for the first car to leave the scene to report it.

If there is a competent human in the car, they will interact with the flagger, and give some basic inputs to the car to turn around, take alternate routes etc. if there is no data.  Usually there will be data.

So the only real question is about an unmanned car in an area with no data who is the first car to come upon the flagger, and the flagger does not use any type of hand signal which is common or is used by other flaggers.  The car will know all the common hand signals on its own.

Yes, the car just stops, blocking the only lane, in an already congested area where rerouting is nearly impossible because the extra lanes have already been physically blocked off for construction.

&gt; 2. How well does the navigation handle being interrupted and sent in what may be a very non-ideal route?

This should be a non-issue.  If you have used any navigation software, it would work just like that and route like you missed a turn or something.  The only issue I see is you could force an SDC onto a route that is outside it's Geo-fence which would be a problem for sure.  As the service areas get larger this is less likely to happen.

What is more important is that as SDCs become more common and cities start to regulate them, a lot of new possibilities open up that never existed before.  As an emergency worker, you could have the road shut down to through traffic.  This would feed into the fleet systems in real-time and they would avoid using the road if possible.

What about this post supports that or is it something you are providing as background information on your personal opinion?  Would be helpful if you could replace ""Mass Production"" with something more concrete.  In the US we produce 17M cars/year.  Some models only sell 10k units/year while others sell 1m/year.  Given how long SDCs last and how many cars they can replace, it's tough to know what level of production will be needed to have a huge impact on driving.  For example in Phoenix, you could replace Uber/Lyft with about 1500 cars and capture ~2% of miles driven.  Is that ""Mass Production"" levels?  What if you got to 2% in the top 10 cities?

&gt; ...autopilot modes will get legislation soon that make them difficult to implement.

This could always be true.  You are seeing just a little of this in Europe but I'm don't think it rises to the level of ""difficult to implement"" yet, more like not as good for the consumer.  I think Europe will be a leading indicator if this will happen or not.  If you see truly restrictive rules in Europe, then start worrying about the US, but not before that.

&gt; Driver training will save more lives, you must improve your driver skill

Pipe dream to improve them much more than they are now in the US.  We can't do what Europe does because they have actual options for alternative transportation until they can spend enough money to pass all the trainings.

Existing AP does save lives. If it doesn't always it doesn't mean it should be scrapped. Should be stop using airplanes because they still keep falling (total number of passenger airplanes crashes is  \~10 per year)

I know this area well. Card Sound Road is an isolated stretch of highway, a perfect place to use Autopilot. It's also very common for people all throughout the keys to be pulled over on random parts of roads, enjoying the beaches, swimming and fishing. 

The intersection of this Card Sound with 905 is a T shape. My guess is the Tesla driver was enjoying AP on Card Sound and perhaps dozed off/perhaps was drunk/became complacent in some way and totally missed the end of the road, and continued on into the cleared brush until the car hit the pedestrians and stopped in the brush (you can see part of this in the video). The pedestrians were 40 feet off the road(!). How did AP not react to the traffic signs which obstruct the end of the highway? How does one do this without attempting any correction?!

I mean the obvious answer is when SDCs offer a service competitive with Uber and Lyft, but the details of that are complicated.

A much easier, albeit slightly less complete, answer is when SDCs are as safe as humans within their predefined constraints (speed limits, geofence, restricted areas, etcetera).

You can say anything is a sliding scale, but to argue there is no concrete goal for what a self-driving car is is to argue that all of the SDC companies literally don't know what their target is.

105,WeldAE,"&gt; Because if you have a connected infrastructure so you know where vehicles are (as they ping lights) you can modify the light timings to reduce congestion.

I believe that optimizing traffic lights is NP-complete.  That isn't to say there isn't some improvements that can't be done but it's a hard problem and like you said, I don't think anyone has done it yet.  More than coordination, just having the lights individually behave more efficiently would be a huge win.  Today they already use ground loops to detect traffic on side streets or turn lanes and will skip those lanes if they are empty.

An intersection that can ""see"" the traffic can be even more efficient.  Today if even one car is detected by the turn lane ground loop, it triggers the lane for whatever time is setup by the city engineers.  This could the turn light to stay green for far too long.  If the intersection was smart, it could turn the turn lane light green and then go yellow as soon as the single car entered the intersection.

&gt; Though if a city is replacing lights anyway, they might as well replace them with connected lights, or ones that can be easily upgraded.

The lights themselves wouldn't have anything to do with it.  The lights are just circuits controlled by the box on the pole.  It's this box that would need upgrading eventually and cameras added.  It is highly unlikely that anything you bought today would be workable for any eventual solution and the entire controller box would have to be replaced.

122,WeldAE,"&gt; States frequently take on some technology before there is mass adoption

That doesn't make it a good idea and I can be against it.  In addition, most of the proposals I've heard like your beacon idea would be way larger than any wildcat project taken on by state or local governments.  Most of the roads SDCs will drive on are city roads which don't fall into state control.  The state won't pay for anything on a city road typically.  They will share a project where a road is both covered by the state and the city but they expect the city to kick in their portion of the funds.  Cities don't do big high risk long term projects as a rule.

&gt; If a state like California decides to implement these RF technologies on the roads because the California legislature feels this will greatly accelerate the adoption of the technology, then that is their business.

It is also the business of it's citizens who actually pay for it.  I'm not sure how I wouldn't be able to have standing if I lived in a state trying to do something like this.

&gt;  If it works and greatly reduces the problems of fog, rain, snow, or something else which creates issues for the lidar/cameras then other states will follow. 

Obviously, but more likely other states will build something entirely different or nothing at all.  Getting this far out ahead of something means you have almost no chance of getting it right the first time.  California in your example will be left with at best a bunch of wasted money and at worst, an albatross of a system they can't replace with better solutions that costs a lot of money to maintain.

&gt; States where weather could be a major issue will see the technology demos and either decide to build some comparable system and possibly reap the benefits of infrastructural efficiency or risk being left behind.

I'm not aware of a single player on the fleet side that has asked for any such systems. Maybe I missed it?

&gt; Hell, it could be just an upgraded type of of raise pavement marker which doubles as a RFID type locator.

You mean like [Bott's Dots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-A6hHG7-vc)?  There is pretty good proof that they don't improve saftey and they are being removed.  Passive RFID has a range of just a few inches and active requires power and even then is only maybe 100 meters but that is with really high power and really big antenna on the car.  If you add more electronics including an accurate time source in the RFID you can still only triangulate to 10 feet.  GPS is good to 3 feet 98% of the time to give you an idea of accuracy.  I'm not sure how many RFID tags you could triangulate and how latent it would be since it isn't commonly done with RFID.

&gt;  I have strong reason to conclude that TAAS will likely replace car ownership for the vast bulk of urban and suburban populations and be a system which is far more efficient and convenient than any existing mass transit and far cheaper than owning a car in a city.

140,rileyoneill,"There is an adage by Roy Amara that I think it relevant here.    


""*We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run""*  


We seem to have two types of predictions.  One prediction is that Self Driving Cars will be here tomorrow and the other prediction is other extreme that self driving cars will start to take hold several decades away.  Decades.  Not years.  Decades.    


Both are clearly wrong.  The early prediction folks are the easiest to disappoint because their early prediction didn't come true.   However, to their benefit, there has been considerable progress every year along the way.  Whatever goal we have, we are clearly getting closer to that goal.   The fact that so many players are in this space, all spending a great deal of money in solving this problem is progress.    


The extreme pessimists are much more difficult to disappoint.  However, their forecast of several decades away is silly.  Technological capacity increases by many orders of magnitude over decades.  My 1998 iMac had 32 megs of RAM, you get an Apple Watch now with like 768 megs of ram.  Explaining someone in 1999 that in 20 years a wrist watch will have more computational power than their desktop computer would come off as silly.   The monitor technology didn't exist, the hard drive didn't exist.    A modern desktop computer would be an absolute super computer by the standards of 20 years ago.   Everything about self driving cars is technology based and improves every year.   20 years from now computers will be a factor of 1000 times as powerful as they are today (and 100,000 times as powerful 30 years from now).    


This is the tech prediction I have made, and I make about most technologies.  That prediction is.  every year that goes by the investment capital into Self Driving Cars grows.  The engineering talent, the budgets, the number of companies in the space.  Every single year the capital going into this is increasing.  The result is that each year the rate or progress increases.  As the progress increases more people aware of the opportunity and invest more money into it.   This is a feedback cycle of progress, the progress in the space brings in more money which produces more progress.   This prediction is all about a constant acceleration and improvement.   But its also why there is far more money invested in 2019 than there was in 2009 and also far more progress in 2019 than there was in 2009.    


This nonstop progress is eventually going to hit a point where the technology works in a certain marketplace, in certain conditions, and will launch commercial service.  This commercial service will not be the end of cars, but will be the beginning of the transition.   Self Driving Cars do not have to work everywhere to work.  They just have to work in their respective marketplaces and then over time those marketplaces will grow.  It doesn't matter if the technology doesn't work in snow covered and sparsely populated Wyoming , if it works in Arizona it will launch in Arizona.  If it works in California it will launch in California.    I think we will see Arizona, Nevada, and/or California service go live at somewhere around Summer 2021/2022.  Maybe not everywhere in the states, but it will be a thing that people in these areas will use.   All eyes will definitely be on this part of the country and competitors will be racing to deliver their own technology and expand the marketplace.   I think the following years after that there will be service very quickly spreading elsewhere in the country and most likely in cities in the sunbelt.  The development will continue and the technology will continue to improve allowing the cars to better handle rain, snow, fog, and other conditions which are an issue in other parts of the country.  Voters elsewhere in America will want this technology and vote for politicians who have plans to make their roads work with it if need be.     


I think this process will mostly be over by 2030.   There will be disruption regarding new car sales in urban/suburban markets likely within a year or two after SDC launches in those areas that will just get worse and worse every year.   We are gradually starting to see this as something like 10% of people who sell their cars don't buy a new one.  If that jumps up to 30% of people who sell their cars don't buy a new one the market will become rich with used cars and poor with new car buyers.

Absolutely.  But this issue is in nearly everything the government is involved with.  Costs are extremely high here and there are likely several reasons for it.  This should be one of the major bi-partisan issues of our time.    I agree, we should be eventually narrowing roads and increasing pedestrian spaces, especially in major cities.  I am simply talking about a road marking system that allows the SDC car to accurately measure where it is on the road based on the location of several known beacons around the road.   If TAAS is successful much of the car infrastructure will drastically change and space will likely be repurposed for other uses with disappearing parking being the big one.",1565773330,ewubbya,t1_ewr61x5,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

 If their service actually works, and eventually it will, at least in some communities in the US, the news will spread like a wildfire.  YouTubers will profile it, people in the service areas will immediately see ads for it.  The target audience for such a service as early adopters are going to be young people, people who do not own cars, and tech heads who have to try the newest thing.  Marketing TAAS to these people is going to be extremely easy.   If they launch 10,000 TAAS vehicles in Los Angeles I figure there will be 100,000 users by the end of the week.  Word will spread very quickly.

148,rileyoneill,"States frequently take on some technology before there is mass adoption, sometimes it works, sometimes it does not.  If a state like California decides to implement these RF technologies on the roads because the California legislature feels this will greatly accelerate the adoption of the technology, then that is their business.  If it works and greatly reduces the problems of fog, rain, snow, or something else which creates issues for the lidar/cameras then other states will follow.   States where weather could be a major issue will see the technology demos and either decide to build some comparable system and possibly reap the benefits of infrastructural efficiency or risk being left behind.  

The ROI is going to be seem as elimination of traffic or citizenry being able to move around more efficiently.   TAAS is potentially the ultimate mass transit, even if the operators are all privately owned.  If these operators can demonstrate that simple and relatively affordable beacons can enable the to drive much better in all conditions, some municipalities will definitely bite.   They could be something that has a cost comparable with a raised pavement marker. Hell, it could be just an upgraded type of of raise pavement marker which doubles as a RFID type locator.  The car can scan the road and pickup several locators at once and very accurately triangulate its location in any type of weather.  It may be some sort of redundant fallback system in addition to the lidar and camera system.  

Communities which adopt TAAS are going to change their transportation policies.  I have strong reason to conclude that TAAS will likely replace car ownership for the vast bulk of urban and suburban populations and be a system which is far more efficient and convenient than any existing mass transit and far cheaper than owning a car in a city.   A city with 1M people and 700k of those people adopt TAAS would likely have a GDP increase of billions of dollars that would be spent on other things.  Some community in America is going to do it first and if it works they are going to be the model that many emulate.

""It's at least the 20th time it's happened to me in 35k of driving, and each time I've been lucky there has been no one following closely behind me... one of these times I might not get so lucky...""

""As an Ex-Tesla Empoyee and a S 100D owner I can tell you that this in fact is normal behavior. It's really bad and dangerous and I hate it when it happens.""

""This is my single biggest issue with using AP (speed hold, auto steer and NoA). Like another post here, I now just keep my foot barely touching the accelerator so that I can quickly overrule the braking. However, it doesn't make for a relaxed AP experience. Also, it hasn't gotten better with new firmware updates, so it's something wrong with the programming logic. ""

""Unwanted/unnecessary braking on cruise control occurs nearly every time I use it, which is nearly every time I drive, going on 12 months now.""

""My commute is less than twenty minutes.  It will phantom brake HARD once (~20mph), and drop about 6-10mph three other times. Signs and overpasses.  Every. Goddamn. Day.""

1. It's a black box as such it's difficult to test and validate. When the Uber incident happened, we knew exactly what went wrong i.e what the car saw, what it was thinking and why it acted the way it did. It was quite easy to see how the problem could've been prevented/could be fixed. For a E2E DNN car, we can't know why. And the only way to fix is to show it more examples of similar scenarios (which might be rare), discourage it from the undesired behaviour and hope it learns. This is not good enough when safety is top priority.
2. Driving styles/rules and regulations vary widely across cities. These styles/rules need to be encoded in some way into the software. You can't have a world-wide DNN with all the different styles and rules (some of which conflict against each other). George Hotz has said the best solution might be to create city neural nets e.g NYC-DNN, London-DNN etc. This makes the E2E approach similar to the HD Maps one where cities need to be mapped in 3d.

The system will get smarter and associate all object tracking and learning from moving objects in a video.  So it's not just static images, it's movement too and the differences with those changes.

221,WeldAE,"&gt; For some reason people are against upgrading roads in the United States for future technology.

I think it's a bit more complex than simply being against any upgrades.  I'm against RELYING on non-light spectrum systems for roads.  I'm also against building anything that increases costs without providing substantial benefit.  How to define ""substantial"" is tough but something with a full ROI return in the first 20% of the lifetime of the upgrade.  For now this means no upgrades that also don't benefit manual cars.  So SDC have to boot strap off existing infrastructure which means they don't need the new infrastructure.

So what about when SDCs have some amount of usage?  At that point it gets a lot easier to justify and also pick the right tech.  Lets say Waymo starts running 50k SDCs in Phoenix and they are having problems navigating construction efficiently.  They suggest that all construction crews to use an RF beacon so they can know the left lane is closed or something.  Since this isn't required to navigate the construction and only helps make it more efficient, I'm fine with non-visible spectrum systems.  Since there are a significant number of SDCs on the road, adding this requirement to construction crews could ""probably"" be justified.  It might even be added to manual cars if they still exist.

Yes, Waymo does have robo-taxis in a designated, limited area on Phoenix and they are driving occasionally without safety-driver. The effort necessary, to go from this to worldwide availability seems huge. I don't count on having a Waymo car anytime soon where I live.

This is usually *better* than what we humans can do.

The same goes for LIDAR. Sure we humans don't have that built in, and sure you can build a self-driving car without it.

However, I can't exactly follow you through to your conclusion.  How much capital you have in play has no reflection on who wins, it just limits the players.  Tesla would be one of the players that was kept on the outside by limited capital but they have a plan to leverage their customer base to massively reduce their capital needs. 

However, Waymo has no such need.  So while this is important for Tesla, it doesn't give them an advantage over Wayo since according to Tesla's own plan, they will pay more money out to the car owner than the entire capital cost Waymo has today.  Sure, all that can change, but as the differential shrinks between Waymos per unit cost and Tesla's slice to owners, Tesla will be forced to carry the rolling stock cost themselves and Elon was very careful not to rule that out when asked.

However, I think there is the potential for a new cost structure as well as new business models that will ultimately change the game. Electric changes the cost structure substantially, but so does a business model like Tesla’s proposed rideshare network wherein the car owners contribute the capital assets. This would make rides substantially cheaper than any alternative, and it’s possible that even without the critical mass of drivers that Uber and Lyft have, that people would wait 5x longer, if they got to ride in a Tesla instead of a Prius, and it were 1/10 the cost (I know I would!).

440,Cerberusz,"&gt; All Uber has is a User base. If waymo beats then to market google will shit out a useable app in no time. People overestimate how easy it is for users to shift to competitors.

This is a gross oversimplification. Uber has a lot more than a user base. It has a network of riders and drivers. Because of the network, it takes advantage of network effects. Riders go to Uber because they have drivers and drivers go to Uber because they have riders. A lot of Uber’s tech is around balancing supply and demand such that when people request an Uber, there is an acceptable wait time. How you manage the network here is no small technical feat.

Building this network is extremely expensive because switching costs are low (as you mention). However, that doesn’t mean you can just crank out an app easily and make people switch. You still need a critical mass of drivers to lower wait times to acceptable levels. Note that in traditional network effects, the value of a network increases with the addition of a node. However, rideshare networks are asymptotic networks, meaning, the value of the network increases with the addition of each node, up to a point. The point in this case is when wait times are sufficiently short that a 3 minute difference versus a 4 minute wait do not materially impact demand.

Waymo actually has beat Uber to market with AVs. You can go to Phoenix today and get one. However, they haven’t beat Uber yet. What is stopping them is that it is currently prohibitively expensive to build out the driver side of the network, with each car costing about $200k.

Because humans are somewhat rational actors, they will choose the network that offers the quickest, safest service for the lowest cost.

So, anyone in the AV game needs to not just have autonomous driving, but be able to deliver it in a cost effective manner (for the vehicle). They also need to deliver it in a business model that is as minimally capital intensive as possible. Think about Uber’s business and realize that they are far from profitable, and this is without owning any of the cars!

Still, if a company is able to meet all these hurdles, other companies will be able to as well. There will still be absolutely no switching costs. There is little ability to differentiate transportation (see airlines), so cost will ultimately be the driving force (holding safety constant).

The winner in the space will need to not only solve for AVs, but do so in a way without having much capital in play, and doing so in a way that provides a significant cost advantage to their competitors.

To me, this is why Tesla’s strategy is quite compelling. Electric can deliver about 1/10th the cost, and allowing Tesla owners to contribute their own car would solve for the capital portion. The key though will be the AV part, and they are taking an unconventional approach without LIDAR. But if they can solve for it, they are at a huge cost advantage.",1565544604,ewm6xmi,t1_ewlyb13,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

That'll happen if you have half a million vehicles out in the wild vs a few dozen in limited / controlled environments.

&gt;I have yet to see soneone explain with common sense this so called ""data advantage"".

It's pretty simple; neural nets / machine learning systems need an immense amount of human-labelled data to correctly operate in the real world. You can get a lot of data via randomly / procedurally generated simulations, and everyone (including Tesla) does that, but the real world has a lot of things that people don't recognise and incorporate into those simulations.

Say for example that you're working on allowing your car to navigate along roads (lane keep) when the roads are coated in snow. What your doing to achieve this is to have your AI look at the surrounding environment and gauge where the road should be based on what looks like gutters or ditches, treelines, buildings, etc. One useful thing to look for in snow are existing car treadmarks; where other cars have successfully driven before, leaving a dark depression in the surface.

But what if your car makes it to a sloped road where kids (or adults) have been sliding down the road with sleds? To a neural net that's only lived in a simulation designed around typical road usage, it'd make sense to assume that's a car or motorbike's treadmark and to follow that line. If those people were sliding on the snow on a footpath or a gutter however, your car's potentially just run off the road.

So to account for the various ""edge-cases"" that actually appear quite frequently, you realistically need real-world testing, and you need a lot of it, not just so that you actually encounter edge-cases, but also so that you gather enough data for the AI to identify variations and different perspectives of the same thing. If you just have cars driving around a single suburb or town, you will encounter a bunch of random things, but not nearly as many as if you expanded globally.",1565483729,ewkgfty,t1_ewj48hr,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

I'm sure you are no doubt familiar with the fact that the lidar market for autonomous cars is stratifying into varying levels of capabilities. While there is a need for forward-looking narrow field of view, longer range units (Luminar, Innovusion, Waymo 1550 nm), there is also a place on autonomous cars and trucks for shorter range perimeter scanning. This is why Waymo cars have supplemental small short-range lidars (Honeycomb) on the fenders and bumpers to see where the big lidar can't see.

The Velodyne HDL-32E, with identical range and field of view as the Puck 32MR, have been used on [NVIDIA self driving car](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/10/23/introducing-self-driving-safety-report/) and [Ford self driving car](https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1108045_ford-outlines-steps-to-ensure-safety-of-its-self-driving-cars).

580,phxees,"&gt;	You missed the part where I pointed out that Tesla already claims their vehicles can detect when a lane change is safe, and they have long had the ability to know if there is another car to the side using ultrasonics as well as cameras.

Yes, they can make a lane change with supervision.  You are saying when the system suspects the supervision isn’t present, the car does something *slightly* dangerous.

Anything the car does other than try to get the driver’s attention using visual and audible cues is **dangerous**.

Here’s a real world example of why this is dangerous.  I use Autopilot every week day on my commute between home and work.  The map says the shortest route is to get off on one exit, but sometimes I want to take the one before it.  on these days, I should cancel navigation, but a few times I just put my turn signal on to take the exit I want.  I’ve noticed that Autopilot gets into a mode where it wants to leave the exit ramp and get back onto the freeway, but I keep canceling it’s attempts.  Quickly, the car is passed the point where it could safely get back onto the freeway, but it still attempts to anyway.  I’ve never actually let it fully attempt to do what it’s attempting to do, but it seems like it would try to drive through the ditch separating the freeway from ramp.

To be clear ordinarily it never would try to drive off road.  This behavior, is only exhibited when I put it in this persistent correction state.  Instead of me preventing the car from taking its desired path, it could be traffic.

Tesla knows that there are these edge cases, and that is why they say they will get to feature completion. After that they will completely focus on closing these holes.  You cannot expect a car that is not 8-nines perfect in any area to test the driver in the way you are describing.

If you want to test the driver.  Do something safe like turn the hazards on, but only inside the car, and measure how long it takes the driver to cancel them. Or just make them apply torque to the steering wheel occasionally.",1565455762,ewis9e5,t1_ewerov4,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

I use it ~90 miles daily and LOVE it. It transforms an ~$18k Civic into a car whose driver assist features are arguably second only to Tesla for a cost of $700.
Limitations: 1. Really only useful on the highway, but that's on par with most of the other players right now. 2. Depending on the model of car, there are limits to the min speed at which the accel / steering control kick in. My Civic has acceleration control all the way to 0 but steering goes inactive at 13mph. Can be annoying in stop and go traffic. 3. Depending on the make and model of car, limitations in vehicle firmware may restrict the total degrees of steering the hijacked lane keep assist can apply to the steering wheel as well as the total amount of torque applied. In my commute I have three spots where the limit will be reached and open pilot will ask me to take over.

I'm a core developer for the Tesla OpenPilot Fork and have driven over 30,000 miles with OpenPilot. It works better than AP1 for everything but stop &amp; go traffic, and it only fails there because pre-AP tesla's dont have an iBooster to control the friction brakes, so our fork has to use the regenerative brakes which only slow the car down to ~6 mph.

The current model is great, steering controls (on a pre-ap tesla) is much smoother than AP1 or AP2+. If you look at a Tesla on Autopilot's steering wheel when doing long and sharp turns, you will see it jerk quite a lot, OP has none of that in their current model. The only issue it really has is some cars don't have a EPAS' with enough torque for some sharper turns. The new 2019 corolla, that is officially supported, and obviously Tesla which have the same epas' as new teslas, have a strong enough EPAS' to make every turn.

While the current model is extremely good, it's based on current machine learning practices of label everything, build models, test what is produced. Not much different than every other self driving company out there, but definitely the best executed experience thus far when it comes to highway driving. hands-free perfect steering with driver monitoring just cannot be beaten.

The real details are curious.

He got the full suite of warnings, all the way to the car starting to slow down.  Once he got the slow down, he grabbed the wheel.   After grabbing the wheel it turned off cruise control.  (That is odd, usually it turns off autosteer, not cruise control.)  Then it says ""steering override"" which I presume means autosteer off.   Perhaps he touched brakes and wheel?

Anyway, 0.6 seconds later it says ""cruise control enabled"" but does not mention autosteer.    On the Tesla, you click the stalk once for cruise control, twice for autopilot.  Perhaps he only clicked once and thought he clicked twice.

&gt;The other problem is even if both eyes are on the road, your hands are on the steering wheel, and your feet on the pedals you will react slower if you aren't actively involved in driving the car. We know humans are really bad at tasks like this.


I can't say that I agree. Humans are also really bad at driving straight on a highway for hours at a time, and humans are already quite distracted in their cars fiddling with the radio, getting their sunglasses out of the center console, texting, and other bullshit. driver assistance systems might still be safer even if they aren't perfect, and even if they slow the reaction time in some cases to people who don't follow the rules. And ideally driver assistance systems will know when something isn't right and will alert the user to take over before it is an accident, giving them ""negative reaction time"" in those cases.


The idea that ""slower reaction time in some cases means AP is unsafe"" just isn't true. Even if humans are garbage at taking over for AP in emergent situations, if emergent situations happen significantly less frequently due to AP, it's a net win for safety.

It's kinda like the argument against seat belts and airbags. Yes, a seatbelt can mean that in the event you need to escape the vehicle quickly you could be slowed down cutting a seatbelt off, but the risk of that happening is far outweighed by the benefits they provide. I'm not in a position to determine if AP is safer or not like that, but I assume the NHTSA is, and they seem to think it's okay for the time being.


And I still haven't seen any of these hypothetical situations where something like the increased response time of taking over for autopilot caused any accidents, except in cases where the driver was negligent in several other areas (like the exact article you posted. The driver had almost 10 full seconds to see what was happening in front of them after enabling autopilot, and they ignored warnings and didn't pay attention at all. That's not a failure of autopilot (except that they should probably be more strict about monitoring attention), that's a failure of the driver to follow the rules and pay attention to the road around them.

724,Klathmon,"Personally I think it shows that Tesla needs to be a lot more strict about disabling Autopilot when there are repeated instances of the hands not being on the wheel.

The data shows that the driver was taking an average of 30 seconds to put their hands on the wheel after they were first alerted about it in the trips leading up to the crash, and in the minute or so before the crash they ignored a visual alert, 2 different chime alerts, and the car started slowing down to pull over before they finally put their damn hands back on the wheel, then enabled AP again less than a second after taking control again.

IMO they need to do a lot more to make sure that the driver is paying attention, and to disable the feature MUCH sooner if it's clear the user isn't paying attention.


I'd argue 30 seconds to respond to a ""put your hands on the wheel"" alert is way WAY too long. I would have assumed it was something like 15 seconds before it started slowing down and pulling over. I'd be interested to see my own personal stats here, but I really feel like I haven't waited more than 5 seconds after an alert to put my hands back on the wheel. 60 seconds seems like an eternity!

They can also have contracts with energy companies to purchase massive amounts of power during peak production periods.  TAAS companies will be turning rooftop solar into miles sold to customers.  Even if they charge 10 cents per mile they will be at a minimum 10 folding the energy cost.  

Either way you whack it up.  The savings per mile from going to gas to electric are massive.  The savings you get from going from driver to driverless are also massive.  This is why I think its going to be 1/5th to 1/10th the cost of an Uber ride today (plus a monthly membership fee). The labor cost per car will likely drop by a factor of 10 (there won't be drivers but TAAS companies will still have a staff.  Likely people cleaning them, or servicing them in the field, customer support and the like). 

In the very near future, people who do not have cars or need new cars are going to have a question ""Do I go thousands of tens of thousands of dollars in debt to buy a car that I then have to fuel, have to maintain, have to insure, have to park, and have to be responsible for"" or ""Do I just use TAAS rides at $1-$5 per day to get around and existing public transportation for longer distances"".

I work inside a Bay Area AV start-up.  The pace is hectic, but everybody is engaged b/c of the high-quality of engineering leadership.  We've hired well (a mix of talent and humility) and we want to ship.  People are pushed, but they seem to like it - this is part of the reason they joined.  They want to do something impactful.

Work/life is like any start-up, but at mine most engineers are there 9a - 6/7p.  It's professional and there is no need to sleep under your desk.  Having said that, I have seen a few late-nighters from time to time.

Career trajectory is where you get a big bump.  At least where I am, engineers are working on the cutting edge of systems dev, ML, computer vision and more.  At a start-up you get to do more, so if you build something meaningful it can take a career to the stratosphere.  

Having said that, if you measure career trajectory with compensation only, one can do just as well building some crap nobody cares about at any number of Bay Area companies.  

It's not for everybody.  If you cannot afford risk and just want to play it safe, a smaller AV start-up is probably not the place to be.  You could go to Waymo, Tesla (these are not start-ups) et al., and if things get dicey, just bounce to something safer outside of AV..

* ""what even is the market for retirement home shuttles?"" 
   * uh, you mean buses? huge. sure, there is up-front cost in designing a self driving shuttle bus, but if the sensor suite costs less than $10k, then a fleet of autonomous ford transits will cost roughly half per passenger capacity. so, a city or private bus company can have mini-buses that are 4 times more frequent for the same total capacity, can pull vehicles out of service during off-peak times and still maintain, or could trade that off against more routes. on top of that, it's not considering the possibility that the boring company might actually be able to dig tunnels for less than $80M/mi (hint, they already can). once you have tunnels, it does not make sense to run individual cars through them due to cost per passenger capacity. however, a 16 passenger mini-bus can handle mass-transit but at multiple times the speed.
* ""car ownership is not going down... people like owning cars, for the same reasons people like owning houses"". 
   * first, car ownership and house ownership are not at all the same. second, that all depends on cost and time. for the vast majority of people, it's still faster and cheaper to have their own car for most of their transportation. however, I live in a city and it's a constant discussion among people I know of whether to get rid of their cars, because both the cost and time are pretty close to even right now with Uber and Lyft. also, the conversation is more often that they WANT to get rid of their car, but it's *just* too expensive to Uber everywhere; cars are a nuisance to most people who live in cities; a necessary evil. if you can reduce the cost of Uber by half, then if you can get an 80% subsidy like many bus systems get, and you're talking about a dramatic shift in the conversation. on top of that, if you can pool even 2 groups into the same vehicle (potentially not even the same compartment), you can reduce congestion (ohh, by the way, roughly 40-50% of traffic in a city is people looking for parking, which a taxi/mini-bus service would not need to do), reduce pollution, reduce noise, and generally make living in a city better. will that translate to everywhere in the country? no. which is another problem with the presenter's points; he's not considering that different locations will benefit differently from self driving vehicles. he's also not considering the fact that most families have more than 1 car; so having the freedom of a personally owned vehicle can still be there, while the 2nd car (used for commuting) can be replaced while the van for the kids and for road trips can still be there.
* his generic dismissal of redesigning cities around autonomous vehicles. ""the difference, at best, is cost""
   * no. it's a fundamentally different interaction with transportation. I can't say whether or not self driving cars will be prevalent in 20 years. I think so, but who knows. however, IF you make the assumption that self driving taxis can pool two groups, can get city subsidy like a bus, then car ownership will be the exception for many cities. that means a dramatic shift in the way space is used and a dramatic shift in perception of commuting. if you could sell homeowners an extra 6ft in front of their houses in a city because there is no more need for parking, you better believe people will pay for that. if bike infrastructure no longer angers drivers, because only a small percentage of people actually need the parking that will be reduced/eliminated, then that will be a major shift in the equilibrium. lets not even get started again the the Boring Co's possibility to synergize with self driving shuttles, as putting the just a few of the largest thoroughfares below ground would have a huge impact. I think this guy underestimates how quickly things would change if taxiing becomes significantly cheaper. owning a car is a great piece of a household budget than healthcare, food, student loan debt, and savings. does this guy think healthcare costs being cut in half is not a big deal? does he think student load debt being cut in half isn't a big deal? somebody tell politicians that nobody cares about that \\s.

You could in theory get very low latency with a 5g network, but the cost would be so prohibitive, and the reliability of signals isn't remotely good enough for something this important.

&gt; What I don't think is important are people that give far reaching ""20 years from now we are going to re-think cities around autonomous vehicles"".  Are we?  What is the difference between an autonomous vehicle and an a non-autoonomous vehicle?  At most it's cost.

Given that he says cost might be a factor then he must be talking about ride sharing since if you own the car then cost can't be cheaper for the autonomous version.  So he just completely ignores the main reason we get to re-think cities which is we don't need to dedicate 50% of the land to parking.  If you go read the zone laws for your city you will see that 90% have the car with one driver as the root cause of why the rule is in place.

With autonomous that can all change.  When building a a new 20 story office building with a subway station in the basement, the city won't force the developers back to 12 stories because of traffic congestion.  They can pass laws that says if you are a single rider in a car during rush hour, you will be routed around the congestion areas which will make your trip longer which will mean you will start taking shared shuttles instead.

820,Reigningchamp4eva,"&gt; Waymo numbers from several years ago had 50,000 miles between necessary safety disengagements. Years ago. Tesla is not close. 

Well you said this, when in 2017 they were having safety-related disengagements (which is defined however they feel like) every 5,555 miles, not every 50,000 miles. Currently they're not at 50,000 miles either. There is a lot less transparency than you're portraying it as.

&gt;This vague definition has allowed AV companies to avoid reporting certain events that, depending on how you look at it, could qualify as a disengagement. Last year, for example, a self-driving car owned by GM Cruise ran a red light in San Francisco after the safety driver took control to avoid blocking a crosswalk. [But the company didn’t include the incident](https://jalopnik.com/californias-autonomous-car-reports-are-the-best-in-the-1822606953) in its report because, according to Cruise’s interpretation, the human driver didn’t act out of safety concerns or a failure of the autonomous system.

 [https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/13/18223356/california-dmv-self-driving-car-disengagement-report-2018](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/13/18223356/california-dmv-self-driving-car-disengagement-report-2018) 

But notably blocking the crosswalk gets you a ticket in California, and it puts pedestrians at risk by requiring them to walk into the intersection to cross the street. Waymo is not at 50,000 miles per safety-related disengagement, and they're likely not at (real) 11,000 miles per safety-related disengagement either. These mile reports incentivize companies to basically fudge the numbers to gain the trust of the public, and depending on the company, gain more funding.

I mostly was saying that the video isn't like their first video back in 2016:  [https://www.tesla.com/videos/autopilot-self-driving-hardware-neighborhood-long](https://www.tesla.com/videos/autopilot-self-driving-hardware-neighborhood-long)  which was hard-coded in much like waymo's first ""demos"" and the route was done repeatedly until they got a ""good one"". It was multiple routes, hundreds of rides, and apparently only a couple people reported disengagements.

Now I'm sure that tesla also optimized it for this area 100%, but the fact it's not one route, and the fact they had like 100+ members of the public go on rides is a different situation both from waymo's demo's and tesla's original demo.",1565199915,ew7yt9z,t1_ew7ujjs,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

823,WeldAE,"It's hard to take him seriously when his first point was so completely disingenuous.  He starts out with ride sharing is a small percentage of rides, which is true.  His next point is that L4 ride sharing is a worse product than Uber/Lyft because the service area is smaller, slower and more expensive.  Therefore L4 ride sharing is going to take a product that is a small percentage of rides and make it worse.

This is such a false equivalence and George is smart so he is doing it on purpose.  

Uber/Lyft have 2% of the rides in the US.  The reason they are such a low number is because the price the market is willing to pay for rides means the pool of drivers willing to drive is pretty limited.  This has a feedback effect which also makes the time to get a ride higher.  If drivers were willing to take $1/mile you would see 10x more drivers and they would probably capture 20% of rides in the US.  

More importantly, drivers aren't equivalent to AI.  A driver isn't going to wait around for an hour just to capture a 10 mile ride at 2am where an AI has nothing better to do and costs $0 additional dollars to wait in a parking lot in suburbia or in the garage.

The less service area is just completely false.  Both Uber and Lyft have service areas.  Why their service area in Phoenix is larger than Waymo's, there is no reason to believe that Waymo couldn't expand to match the area covered or even expand beyond it.

Slower is a real problem.  I'm not sure how big of an impact this has, but it will have some for sure.  I have repeatedly spoken out about this problem and believe that SDCs have to be able to ignore traffic laws to drive more like humans which will be safer.

The more expensive argument is just false and completely misleading.  First he quotes $300k to $500k per vehicle.  Even if Waymo did or is paying this much per car, it isn't going to stay that way very long as prices come down.  That said, he throws in another false equivalence when he compares this cost to an Uber Driver saying ""Uber Drivers"" are making that much without comparing the productivity they are doing.  Just like factories buy a robot for $1m to replace a worker that was making $60k, that doesn't mean it's not a huge cost savings.  The robot can work 24/7/365 and never makes a costly mistake, takes less management overhead and lasts for 10 years.  Same with an SDC that can drive 250 miles/day 7 days a week 365 days a year.  At the current ride sharing cost of $2/mile this is $180k/year.  Return on investment is 3 years even at a $500k capital cost.  However, if the car only costs $100k you make $80k on the car the first year.  That is a lot better than the current ride sharing companies are doing per driver which is losing about $10k.",1565197473,ew7ul0h,t3_cl933x,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

825,Reigningchamp4eva,"Sure, but the difference between level 1 and level 2 is exclusively features after all (presence of steering and acceleration). 

Maybe a better classification would be one for autonomy, 5 for capability. 

Is there a human personally responsible for the consequences of the system operating?

Then for capabilities:

Does the system navigate to public addresses without further input?

Does the system operate on city streets?

Does the system operate on freeways?

Does the system operate in all weather conditions a human would be expected to?

What, if any, are the geographical restriction on where the vehicle can automate?

Since the first question basically asks ""is this system truly autonomous"" and is most important, but the other questions are important too. 

Otherwise you get into this weird situation where a mining truck that goes 10 mph truly autonomously on a 2 mile route on private roads is seen as level 4, while waymo's current vehicles are level 2 (the same as mercedes 2013 distronic stuff).

And, of course, the only difference between a level 2, 3 and 4 system is how much liability a company wants to take on, which is a bit weird. If you're like toyota, and you 100% solve FSD, their cautious approach would mean that they would still sell it as level 2 because they wouldn't want to take that responsibility. If you're elon musk you'll probably say your level 2 system is actually level 3.

Crap is maybe a bit harsh, but not useful is more accurate, especially since **everyone disagrees about what level a system is**. For example there's a new ship container vehicle that has no driver, but has a remote ""supervisor"". Is that level 4? Is it level 3? Is it level 2? 

Or say waymo does some rides without anyone in the car, and also without anyone watching it remotely, is the system now level 4? Since I'm sure tesla could do some rides without anyone in the car too (and no one remote) but in a small area. Idk I just feel like the levels just people bogged down in random bullshit. 

Does the system not have anyone else responsible for its actions, and what conditions can the vehicle operate in. That's the main questions. There has been a lot of progress on the latter, but 0 progress in the former.",1565197319,ew7ubrl,t1_ew6np92,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

829,Reigningchamp4eva,"I agree there is real value for level 3, I am just saying that as you said you can't reliably hand it back to the driver in many situations. Honestly I don't see construction zones as being particularly difficult for self-driving cars. I see unprotected left turns as giving them issues, I see merging (or people merging into their lane) giving them issues, I see weather giving them issues (though honestly the weather that's bad enough for SDC is also weather I would probably pass on driving in many cases). 

And of course there's another issue: many of the level 2 accidents so far have been things that the system didn't flag as a problem at all (trailers/fire trucks/that one pedestrian crossing the road that got hit by uber). 

Of course there's a lot of value in level 2 too, and it's way easier. For example with a good level 2 you can listen to audiobooks/podcasts/talk to others in the car/lower stress levels overall. Just having eyes forward while you do it is sufficient to avoid firetrucks etc. in the road. So while reddit acts like it's either 100% attention or 0% attention, I do think there's significant value in a high quality level 2 system. Level 3 is even better, but if you can 100% trust level 3, I feel like you've mostly solved FSD at that point...although weather I can see the argument for.

I don't think they really convinced themselves they have good enough hardware to tackle FSD, they just had no other option. Lidar wasn't nearly cheap enough to use. It still isn't honestly. If like 100M 64 line lidar comes out at 1,000, then we're talking. I do wonder if they could retrofit lidar into the headlights or whatever. 

Since what a lot of people gloss over is there is the race to ship a product, and then there's the race to scale. That's the one thing tesla has a huge advantage on. Say they pull off a miracle and actually solve FSD with cameras in 2026, and waymo solved it like 2024. Tesla would still ""win"", because they would have \~5M teslas on the road by then. 

Anyway, I'm kind of surprised that someone like GM hasn't done a FSD type package like tesla, but with actual lidar, for their cadillac series.

855,newofficeworker,"well, that was my understanding from reading this section:

&gt;Comparing average accuracy rates between camera-only and lidar-based systems may understate the advantages of having actual lidar sensors on a self-driving vehicle.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lidar measures distances by sending out a laser beam and measuring how long it takes to bounce back. The straightforwardness of this approach means it's likely to work in a wide range of situations. That's not necessarily true of camera-based techniques.  
&gt;  
&gt;For example, one of the distance estimation algorithms used in the Cornell paper, developed by two researchers at Taiwan's National Chiao Tung University, relied on a pair of cameras and the [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax) effect. It compared two images taken from different angles and observed how objects' positions differ between the image—the larger the shift, the closer an object is.  
&gt;  
&gt;This technique only works if the software correctly matches a pixel in one image with the corresponding pixel in the other image. If the software gets this wrong, **then distance estimates can be wildly off.**

Every sensor is going to have errors, but you always hope that it ""fails gracefully"" and I can totally see how if you get a pixel mismatch, you don't get a graceful error. LIDAR has its own issues mentioned in the article with reflections, etc but it seems like when it's off it will be off by a much more reasonable amount.",1565182189,ew6ws8c,t1_ew50f4d,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

Having the Driver take control instead of activating the minimal risk condition is a very nice feature to have. (Though if the driver does not take over you'll have to achieve some level of minimal risk condition)

There is real value in creating a Highway L3 instead of a full L4.

The  ""wow that guy is trying to merge into me"" incidents are much easier to deal with than say road construction or accident scenes. with L4 Highway you would have to deal with these, With L3 you can just hand it back to the driver.

I agree tesla is not close overall, but with massive error bars that basically make it hard to tell to any real degree. 

I mostly was saying that waymo might report a (2018) value of 1 in 11k miles or whatever, but in reality they have to take over every \~25-35 miles to take that turn or whatever. Tesla is not close, but clearly waymo isn't either

On what basis? They don't drive in environments that could result in that scenario, nor have they driven remotely close to sufficient numbers of miles. By that I mean highways where semis travel across traffic to turn onto the road: [https://cdllife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Roof-sheared-off-of-Tesla-in-fatal-crash-with-turning-semi-truck-696x497.png](https://cdllife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Roof-sheared-off-of-Tesla-in-fatal-crash-with-turning-semi-truck-696x497.png) HW2/3 have driven \~1.5 billion miles  of autopilot with \~2 fatal crashes. Waymo has driven like 10-20 million. Sure, the miles are different, but for fatal crashes those aren't possible going at 25 mph generally, so if anything we know even less of waymo's potential for fatal accidents. We need at least 750 million miles to get a point for comparison.

&gt;Also, comparing autopilot miles to self-driving miles is inaccurate. Those two aren't the same things; it's like comparing apples to oranges.

They're both systems in which a human is accepting full legal liability for the system which is operating autonomously. Waymo has driven some miles without anyone in the car, but they also have remote safety drivers as well. 

However I would agree truly self-driving miles are different, but as far as we know waymo has 0 of these. Namely, miles driven without a human in the car, and without any remote safety driver.",1565155990,ew66pn8,t1_ew65fh4,SelfDrivingCars,t5_2udmw

It is worth noting that they had rides for everyone on autonomy day. There were disengagements, yes, but there were also multiple routes, and most had 0 disengagements.

At the same time, it is also obvious that vision based self driving IS technically possible, we do it every day. Unfortunately the compute hardware in a model 3 isn't really the same as our brains, and it's not clear if a vision first approach (or any approach for that matter) will succeed.

So clearly, right now, tesla needs lidar (imo) because they're having issues that other teams with lidar aren't, but at the same time I also wonder how many of those lidar systems would correctly recognize a firetruck?

I mean the amount of miles everyone else has driven is basically a rounding error, and they generally have less negligent drivers too.

962,bradtem,"Because many charging stations have only a few chargers at them, though there are exceptions.   You don't want to use superchargers for regular overnight charging.  So you are going to want an average of about 2 hours per car, but possibly more as people may not want to do it each night due to cost.

So imagine you have 6 charging stations and you take 2.5 hours per car.   Well, that means probably no more than 18-20 cars in an 8 hour shift.    At a $10 wage, that's $80 or over $4 per car -- more than the electricity.

So you either need to have something else for the charge jockey to do in that shift, or you need to have a lot more chargers.   But the robotics can't cost a lot.   If a charger will handle 5 cars/night for 365 nights, it has to be quite cheap for a robot to avoid adding $1-$2 per car.    Remember, the average car only uses about 10kwh per day in the USA, which only costs $1 at night -- so you can't add $2 for plugging.

One alternative is to not charge every night, of course.   That might reduce demand which could be bad in other ways.

Near my house is a corporate lot with 70 chargers.  There you could keep somebody busy, serve 200 cars in a shift, and justify the $80 to pay the attendant.   But it's still more than you think.

Again, it may be that you need to have the attendant have another task, like security guard, or online gig worker (night customer support) or something where they can regularly skip out from their main task and plug cars.

There is no chicken-and-egg situation here. 3D object detection is entirely different to semantic recognition. “There is a slow moving thing in the driving path” — car can adjust course and speed to not to hit the object. Further detection can determine the current path and provide first order estimate of future path.
