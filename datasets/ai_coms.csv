The algorithm that Facebook specifically uses is EdgeRank or some now refined version of it. 

But it doesn't matter what the algorithm is. Facebook will be subject to much more stringent laws in the US and abroad if it is a publisher (ie, if it is acting with some editorial control over its content) vs a platform (where anyone can post and no specific posts are given any additional weight). *Clearly, they are exercising control via their very powerful algoooooooookoooorithm.* That algorithm decides what everyone sees and has been shown to be very good at shaping people's views in potentially destructive ways.

I'm not afraid of algorithms. They're a benign thing. I'm not waging a war against them. But Facebook is having their cake and eating it too right now by claiming they aren't a publisher but still exercising control over your feed. Twitter does it as well. My point is simply that by doing that you're no longer any different than CNN or Fox News and do not deserve any of the benefits that come from merely being a platform. You're a publisher.

Depending on your definition, the West represents a bit over a billion people. Where much of the rest of humanity used to be so impoverished that they simply weren't of interest. Africa, Asia and South America are rapidly becoming fully fledged consumers.

None of them are in a particular position where they can just walk out on their job, or careers for that matter... just to make a statement.

So no - They shouldn't cancel BlizzCon, and you shouldn't boycott it either. The issues are far more complicated than one game companies involvement and complete mishandling of a situation. 

Whats even more despicable than the greed which drives companies to such places are you legions of social media outrage-champions slithering out of the woodwork to say,""Fuck Blizzard,'' when a few weeks ago you were oblivious to the plight which you now fight so fiercely combat.

His well-deserved status seems to turn everything into a competition among his supporters, even against other staunch progressives, who tend to be otherwise pretty unified. That's extremely disappointing.

Warren, by the way, isn't ""elite"" in any sense that Bernie isn't. She was born a poor and connectionless Midwestern girl, taught schoolchildren, and returned to university before finally ascending into politics. She's also been talking about the same things Bernie has for as long as I can remember. I've been watching her career closely since 2008 and there's virtually no inconsistency.

So yes it is harder for all black people to get accepted and easier for all Asian people, but in given individual in those communities will experience the inverse.

Because there’s so many Asian applicants it’s harder for any individual Asian to get a spot and since there’s fewer black applicants it’s actually easier for a black student to get accepted.

The Court didn't rule that ""money is speech"", it ruled that speech couldn't be denied simply because it has a monetary cost tied to it. Otherwise the government could legally create a tax to deny speech.

And CU was only about a right already protected for individuals, and extended that to associations of individuals.

And it's not that ""corporations are people"", because ""corporate personhood"" is *not* extended to all the rights that individuals are granted. But the court ruled that the right of speech should include collective speech from an association, and due to our legal system, corporations are identified as associations.

It's also important to note that limits of campaign contributions exist. And corporations are outright prohibited from donating. CU only dealt with independent political expenditures. And those are unable to be restricted as it's the speech needed to praxtice the right of petitioning one's government.

Now, I'm all for prohibiting corporate treasury funds from being able to be used on such spending. And we wouldn't even need to overturn CU (as it was the correct ruling). We need to instead clarify the legal definition of an association in the context of speech.

Citizens United, a political group, should be able to take in donations and use that money to profess the speech that the people donating are desiring to voice. But Walmart, collecting money in exchange for a good or service not tied to political speech, should not be able to use such funds. Just set up a law where money used to promote speech needs to be earmarked to promote such speech.

This preserves the right of collective speech.

I'd truly like to know why people don't support the CU ruling. Why was it incorrect? Not, why do you want it to be incorrect, but why is it legally speaking?",1571201454,f3wgbx4,t1_f3wcibt,technology,t5_2qh16

&gt; Oppress transgendered people: Nope. Democrats are trying to force their morality through government in this area, while Republicans are not.

I'm getting the feeling these ""mistakes"" as I've been thinking you've been making are actually outright attempts to lie and deceive here. Or did you genuinely forget about those bathroom laws forbidding transgendered individuals from using the bathroom they identify as? Or that trump Banned them from serving in the military? 

&gt; Abortion: Murder should be illegal. Period.

If abortion is murder then so is the usage of antibiotics or the consumption of meat. The absolute earliest that a fetus is viable and capable of awareness of it's surroundings is between 18-20 weeks. If there is any ethical cutoff it should logically be there. 

&gt; failed war on drugs: Granted. I oppose legalization of recreational drugs, as do most Republicans. (With a possible exception of marijuana.)

At least you admit to this one. 

&gt; I want to make a list sometime, of all the things Democrats want to control and legislate, compared to things Republicans want to control and legislate. It would probably be 1000:1.


If you do what you'll notice is a difference in intent. Republicans regulate to control and enforce their culture and lifestyle above all. Democrats primarily want to regulate and control businesses to protect individuals from corporate power and abuse.

704,400921FB54442D18,"&gt; Who would determine when someone is lying? What would the punishment be?

There's already a judicial precedent for what constitutes false claims, or for whether or not a claim is factual (otherwise there would be no way to prosecute perjury, or libel, or slander). Why wouldn't you use the existing standard? Why would this law need to redefine the word ""false"" at all when there's already an established legal threshold?

&gt; What you're saying is, if we had this Amendment right now, you'd be ok with Donald Trump and his administration defining when someone is lying and punishing them for it.

Since when do sitting presidents get to arbitrarily change judicial precedent? Admittedly they can and do stack the supreme court, but they don't get to redefine the law by executive order. So, no. You know this isn't what I'm saying; don't be disingenuous.

&gt; Restrictions on speech are nice in theory, but when you actually get to the nuts and bolts, you see what a problem they are.

Sure, but there are plenty of existing examples of laws that restrict speech in ways that we can all agree are socially beneficial, such as the three I mentioned before – perjury, libel, and slander. They all depend on whether the statement given was false, and yet that doesn't pose any threat to anybody's first amendment rights. Nor does the executive branch get to redefine what constitutes libel, slander, or perjury as they please. Furthermore, fraud and incitement are both crimes as well, and nobody's saying ""gee, we shouldn't treat these as crimes, because the constitution guarantees these people the right to cause harm to others with their lies and false claims."" When we actually get to the nuts and bolts, we see that... these laws are pretty well-understood, and useful for the well-being of our society.

Stop trying to pretend there are fundamental constitutional flaws with the principle of calling liars out in court, when we already do it every day. Unless you're trying to show support to the liars, in which case, carry on.",1571192532,f3w5jhb,t1_f3s0dz9,technology,t5_2qh16

Lets take the income tax. It can range from anywhere between 0% and 100%. That is, as you work, either 0% of your earnings are taken as taxes, to up to 100% of your earnings are taken as taxes. At what % do you hit ""slavery""? Certainly you agree 100% of earnings taken would equal slavery, hell, American slaves had less than 100% taken (some earned super low wages much like modern prisoners with jobs, and most had some sort of shitty housing and meals provided for them, so *some* of their labor went back to them). 

So, answer that in the terms of a percentage. As she wants to increase taxes, like the income tax. (Nevermind things like property taxes, where you pay money, you owe money, for owning something).

\- the author brings up how broadcast stations have a requirement to show all ads, why does it matter if a web platform takes the same approach voluntarily?

\- the author says that broadcast stations are regulated because they make use of a public good - the electromagnetic spectrum, and then equates private user data used by Facebook to go on to say that the site should be regulated on the same grounds. Broadcast spectrum is an invisible part of nature that can't be fenced in or guarded like normal property, yet it is also scarce. If not rationed through licensing it would suffer from some kind of tragedy of the commons scenario which would inhibit commercial use, but that licensing also grants a monopoly on something which is finite by nature.

Is my private data really property of the government and a public good, or is it, you know, private? Does the author mean that the government or public gets to claim ownership over your expressed preferences for goods or services or your disclosure of your age or location while using a private service? Shouldn't that belong expressly to a private individual? And if they so choose to use a website that offers them services in exchange for it, is that not a private transaction?

1,SharkNoises,"Saying race is a social construct is just like saying religion is a social construct. Example: christianity isn't a physical object like a tree or a house, it's a set of ideas. People still base their lives around it.

Race being a social construct means that objectively, labels like white or black don't really matter. However, they matter subjectively and the way people understand those labels affects how people treat each other. As an example: at the turn of the 20th century people of Irish decent weren't considered white by most Americans. Now they are considered white. Was there a material change in Irish people that turned them into white people? No. Instead, it's a change in labels that we apply to people as a society and as a culture. 


If it's your understanding that you are one race and it's your belief that you better than other people because of it, you're racist. 

'Race is a social construct' is really just a fancy way of saying that there's no real reason to be racist and that racist beliefs are silly. Saying that 'race is a social construct' somehow means racism isn't real is like saying that you can't believe the crusades happened unless you're Christian.",1568784548,f0nxgbh,t1_f0njsid,technology,t5_2qh16

67,archomps,"We'll just, summarize everything in one comment.

1) Efficiency is not good, and in this case they're only able to really grab light from spectrums not visible to the naked eye, which is really limiting at a level you can't engineer your way around. UV and IR are not very useful wavelengths for energy generation, so a PV window that only grabs from those spectrums will never be able to produce much energy.

2) The angle is awful for most windows. It'd be really hard to justify the cost compared to just having windows that do a great job of selectively allowing in light and also serve as good insulators. Remember, these have to generate more electricity than is lost to heat transfer, either from losing heat in the winter or letting too much heat in during the summer.

3) Making it work in a lab =/= it'll work well outside a lab. There's no reliability testing done on these or validation procedures, but it's likely these will degrade over time just like anything else, which could further hamper their economic viability.

4) Architects/construction firms hate windows with wires. These would have wires. Which can also be a problem with making a window that can open and close, because now you have a wire that also has to move. That could really increase the cost to build.

So for most renewable energy tech, 25-30 years is kind of the standard duration you want something to last. In that span, you have to be able to generate enough electricity to offset the cost. This can be tough depending on where you live, but there are a lot of sunny or windy areas where the cost of renewables is pretty comparable to even natural gas (and we do a really poor job of accounting for the costs to the environment of natural gas, so always bear that in mind too). These windows would have to be pretty close to that life span, and produce enough electricity to justify what would likely be poorer insulation properties and the higher costs of building/installation. Plus repairs/replacement as is needed. Due to the poor angle and the low energy spectrums these grab light from, it's unlikely they'll be able to overcome those barriers and prove economical.

Doesn't mean it's not worth looking into, could wind up being other uses, or maybe some crazy new breakthrough will happen which manipulates some otherwise unknown quirk of physics. Who knows. But for now, these aren't likely to solve or even have a meaningful impact on the problem of generating cleaner energy.",1568789659,f0o1bwh,t1_f0miyup,technology,t5_2qh16
68,swingerofbirch,"It becomes sort of religious to look at Apple as doing something great in the future (like right now there are people saying they are sure next year's iPhone will have everything they were looking for and didn't get this year). It's like people who predict a second coming or end of the world, it doesn't happen, and then they double down on their beliefs.

I say this as an Apple user--end to end with all my products, from Mac to iPhone to iPad (and until recently all my wireless routers, which Apple discontinued).

Apple is just bad at this stuff. And by this stuff I mean they are generally bad at online services and ""smart"" software (AI type stuff). I use Google Photos on my iPhone and it's far more intelligent at letting me search for objects in photos by keyword than Apple Photos. Not only that, but I can search by image file name which you would think Apple would be more adept at since the photos were taken on the iPhone.

Siri is just . . . there are too many problems to list. Sometimes Siri will just not transcribe correctly. Sometimes Siri will transcribe correctly but inexplicably respond as if it heard something other than what it transcribed. 

It does such bizarre things. Like if I say ""Call 222-5555"" it will transcribe it as ""Call to 22-5555"" and then say ""Sorry I can't dial that number."" Same thing the number 4 (for).

Or with Find my Friends, if I say, ""Let me know when Jane leaves her current location."" It will say I can't find an address called ""current location."" BUT, if I edit the Siri request to say ""Let me know when Jane leaves current location"" (deleting ""her""), then it works. BUT, if I just say out loud, ""Let me know when Jane leaves current location"" (purposefully omitting her, it will automatically ADD her to the sentence when I haven't said it and then tell me again it can't find an address called ""current location."" 

Based on my interactions on the iPhone with the Google app and what you're able to do with a voice assistant that isn't part of the OS, its transcription is miles better than Apple. And even using my ""smart"" Samsung TV from 2016, the built in voice recognition is amazing in comparison to the iPhone.

There are so many other examples of Siri fails. Too many to mention. So to me all this stuff about Apple having great stuff in the pipeline is a very similar refrain to what we've been hearing for many, many years about Apple.

I don't think it's a very well run organization. The number of employees they have is small compared to other tech companies and especially compared to their revenue.

There is no shortage of places to put solar panels that have better visibility to the sun and can use better, more efficient, cheaper panels. That's never been the problem. 

The problem is dealing with the intermittent nature of the power that solar energy produces, which fluctuates dramatically due to weather trends that can last weeks. Solar is currently very cheap due to major technical leaps in the manufacture of the panels. However, in order to be useful, each kilowatt of solar generation capacity needs to be accompanies by several hundred kwh of energy storage capacity, or 1 kilowatt worth of peaker plant kept constantly ready to step in whenever there's a discrepancy between supply and demand. Both of these are very expensive.

108,WrecklessMagpie,I live north of Wellington and I'm crying because we only have access to Hughes Net and some other nonsense peovider. I know comcast is scummy but they told us 15 years ago that they'd run internet out to this area in 5-10 years or so and we've still got nothing. We may as well have dial up with how shitty and slow Hughes Net is. I have to go to a friend's house in fort collins to download any games I buy on my playstation because Hughes caps us and then slows our service way down if we go over our data limit.,1568792985,f0o3gtw,t1_f0mcu8g,technology,t5_2qh16

How does it work?

Sending data via light works with fast oscillating LEDs. The blinking goes so fast that they are not perceptible to the human eye. No special lamps are needed, in theory every LED lamp, including those in your living room, can serve as a transmitter. However, additional equipment is needed to make the light flash at the right frequencies. Environmental and sunlight are no problem; a lifion receiver can separate the flashes from the constant light and communicate undisturbed. According to the inventors, the flashing of the LEDs also has no negative influence on the service life. Moreover, the light does not have to be visible. Communication is possible with light pulses at an extremely low brightness or in the part of the light spectrum that is not visible to the human eye.
Lifi works with transceivers, which can both perceive light and emit light, in order to make mutual communication possible. Current solutions use USB dongles that can be connected to a laptop or computer and are equipped with an infrared transmitter to send data back to the lamp that serves as an access point. The access points themselves must of course be connected to a network with an existing internet connection.

Pros and cons

With lifi, the transmitter and receiver must always be able to perceive each other's light pulses. This does not mean that equipment must be in direct view of each other, because light can also be captured through reflection, although or decreases the signal strength. This also makes it immediately clear that lifi is not a fully-fledged replacement for Wi-Fi because, for example, it is not possible to send data through walls. Lifi is seen as an addition to current technologies. An advantage of lifi is that there is no interference with other radio signals. In large cities where the radio spectrum is overcrowded with Wi-Fi networks, that must be an advantage. But lifi also offers a solution in aircraft or hospitals, for example, where interference can have major consequences. In addition, the visible light spectrum in which lifi can work is thousands of times greater than the radio spectrum and is also unregulated; therefore no permission is required to release equipment that communicates with light. Lifi can also be labeled as safer in some respects because it is easier to shield the signal.

Theory versus practice

Research into lifi has been going on for years and in test setups scientists are achieving impressive speeds with technology. For example, researchers from Oxford University already published a report in 2015 in which they describe a 224Gbit / s connection with light over a distance of three meters. Lifi products that you can buy now do not reach those speeds by far. The Dutch company Signify, the former Philips Lighting, is one of the companies that have been selling lifi products since this year. Under the name Trulifi , Signify manufactures lifestyle systems that are intended for the business market, for example to set up a wireless network in offices that uses office lighting . The Trulifi 6002 system can be integrated into existing Signify luminaires and works with invisible infrared light. The system offers speeds of up to 150Mbit / s up and down at a height of 2m within a diameter of 2.2m. USB dongles are needed to connect computers and laptops to the lifinet network.",1568800077,f0o7mzu,t1_f0o7mm6,technology,t5_2qh16

PureLiFi aims for integration and gigabit lifi

 Harald Haas

￼
Professor Harald Haas (1968) demonstrated the lift technology in a TED Talk in 2011. Haas is co-founder of pureLiFi and works as chief scientific officer at the company.

Current lifi products are expensive, relatively slow and cumbersome to use because they require dongles. A company that wants to change that is pureLiFi, based in Scotland. It originated as a spin-off from the University of Edinburgh, where Harald Haas did his research on lifi. Haas is co-founder of pureLiFi and active in the company as chief scientific officer . In recent years, pureLiFi has made a number of lifi products, such as lamps and dongles to connect laptops with lifi. These were mainly products for testing the technology and the company is now taking a new course.
PureLiFi focuses on the development of components that should enable manufacturers to provide their devices with lifi. At the beginning of this year, the company presented its gigabit optical front-end at the Mobile World Congress. This is a small optical module that can capture and send light to make live communication possible. This is in fact an antenna that must be connected to an existing baseband, for example a 5g modem in a smartphone. The optical module of pureLiFi can handle gigabit speeds and that was demonstrated by the manufacturer on the show floor . In addition, the component was built into a laptop. This resulted in a downlink speed of 1Gbit / s and an uplink of around 450Mbit / s.
The speeds that pureLiFi achieves with its hardware are much higher than those of other lifi products that have been marketed so far. In principle, the speed depends on the baseband, or the modem, to which the lifi antenna is connected. Currently additional hardware is also needed to translate the lifi signals, but pureLiFi expects that this will no longer be the case in the long term and that the necessary technology for live communication will be integrated into base bands, as is now the case with Wi-Fi. The current speeds that pureLiFi achieves are linked to the speeds of the wireless network technologies that are now available. Mostafa Afgani, the company cto, tells Tweakers that future components will support higher speeds if base bands also offer higher speeds.",1568800169,f0o7p28,t1_f0o7ops,technology,t5_2qh16

196,opum123,"Applications

Lifi is especially interesting for high-speed communication at short distances. An obvious application is the creation of a home or business network where computers and laptops are connected to the network and internet via the lighting in rooms or offices. For that, dongles are still needed, but companies such as pure LiFi envision a future in which lifitransceivers become a standard part, just like a wifi chip and antenna that are now in many devices. All kinds of electronic equipment in the house could then be connected to lifi, from computers, smartphones and tablets to TVs and refrigerators.
Due to the high transfer rates that are possible, lifi is also interesting for wirelessly connecting virtual reality and augmented reality glasses to computers. It is currently possible to connect some vr headsets wirelessly; current solutions use the 802.11ad protocol, also known as WiGig, which operates at a frequency of 60GHz. That wifi variant is suitable for data transfer over short distances, something in which lifi is also strong. There are currently no vr glasses that work with lifi, but it could well be that manufacturers are already working on this behind the scenes. PureLiFi specifically mentions this as a market in which lifi must offer a solution. That company also sees lifi as a way for mutual communication between cars. In many cases, cars already have LED lights, so the infrastructure is already largely present.
There has been a concrete interest in lifi from the aviation industry for years and that is not surprising. Interference is a problem with wireless connections in aircraft and lifi offers no risk in that regard. According to aircraft builders, the use of lifi also saves weight because less cabling is required. There are currently no airplanes in the air that actually use lifi, but several companies and companies are experimenting with it and have shown demonstrations.
PureLiFi, for example, works together with Astronics, a supplier of aircraft interiors. That company showed a lifi connection at an exhibition in April based on infrared light at a speed of 60 Mbit / s, which is sufficient to stream 4k videos. In aircraft, for example, lifi can be incorporated into the reading light above seats. By using infrared, the connection also works without providing visible light. According to Astronics, the technology is mature and it is only a matter of time before lifi come to planes.",1568800238,f0o7qmd,t1_f0o7p28,technology,t5_2qh16

I did read it. On page 204, the transcript reads:

&gt;Q. Where did you go to have sex with Marvin Minsky?   
&gt;  
&gt;A. I believe it was the U.S. Virgin Islands, Jeff's -- sorry, Jeffrey Epstein's island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

That rules out the semantic argument that she was *directed* to, but did not actually have sex with Minsky. The deposition *does* say that sex occurred. As evidence, we don't automatically accept it as true, but it's a lot stronger than someone who wasn't there claiming something did not occur, i.e. the claim made by Gregory Benford and cited by /u/slacka123 and /u/sodiummuffin.

Benford, likewise, didn't read the deposition. [He says](http://archive.is/nZIjt#selection-269.0-269.178):

&gt;Note, never says what happened. If Marvin had done it, she would say so. I know; I was there. Minsky turned her down. Told me about it. She saw us talking and didn’t approach me.

Benford's evidence is hearsay from a dead guy. It confirms that the approach occurred. He assumes Minsky was telling him the truth, but he wasn't there, and he can't seem to think of any motive another man might have for lying about whether sex occurred.

Likewise, Stallman has absolutely no way of knowing what happened, or what Minsky knew or didn't know, because Minsky's dead and they never even talked about it. It's 'woulda' all the way down. 'He wouldn't have had sex with an underage girl knowing she was being coerced.' 'He woulda thought she was willing.' And if he did, it doesn't matter if she was 17 rather than 18, and it doesn't matter that she was trafficked to the island for the purposes of having sex with Minsky. It's the narcissist's prayer.

This is my first and last comment on the subject. I'm not here to argue about it. My point is not to trust anyone who doesn't demonstrate they have *read the primary sources.*",1568804272,f0oajhl,t1_f0ma3xh,technology,t5_2qh16

Also tritium decays by a beta particle. A thin surface of water only a few atoms thick can easily stop that to the point where it would literally be impossible to measure unless you are in the radioactive water itself. 

Lastly the US should just buy the tritium for cheap. Tritium is hard to get and it takes a lot of energy to do so.

Here is the NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a government agency in charge of oversight) on tritium.

""Once tritium enters the body, it disperses quickly and is uniformly distributed throughout the soft tissues. Half of the tritium is excreted within approximately 10 days after exposure. About 10 percent of the dose from any tritium exposure comes from the small fraction of the exposure that the body retains as organically bound tritium (ICRP-30, 1979)""

""Humans receive approximately 50 percent of their annual radiation dose from natural background radiation, 48 percent from medical procedures (e.g., x-rays), and 2 percent from consumer products. Doses from tritium and nuclear power plant releases account for less than 0.1 percent of the total background dose (NCRP, 2009). As an example, drinking water for a year from a well with 1,600 picocuries per liter of tritium (comparable to levels identified in a drinking water well after a significant tritiated water spill at a nuclear facility) would lead to a radiation dose (using EPA assumptions) of 0.3 millirem (mrem). That dose is:
at least 2,000 to 5,000 times lower than the dose from a medical procedure involving a full-body CT scan (e.g., 500 to 1,500 mrem from a CT scan)
1,000 times lower than the approximate 300 mrem dose from natural background radiation
50 times lower than the dose from natural radioactivity (potassium) in your body (e.g., 15 mrem from potassium)
12 times lower than the dose from a round-trip cross-country airplane flight (e.g., 4 mrem from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles and back)""

&gt;The scientific reality is tritium emits an incredibly weak beta particle that is easily stopped by our dead skin layer. It only goes a quarter inch in air. Even ingestion of tritium doesn’t do anything unless it’s at very high concentrations that can only be maintained in the laboratory.

&gt;The health risks of tritium-contaminated water are so low that all countries of the world have no idea what regulatory limits to put on it.

&gt;Using Becquerel per liter as the concentration unit (a Bq is a disintegration of a single nucleus per second), the United States has set 740 Bq/L for drinking water, but Canada has 7,000 Bq/L as its limit. Switzerland set 10,000 Bq/L, and Australia a whopping 76,103 Bq/L.

Say it removes C^1 amount of Co2, at a cost of E^1 amount of electricity and a power plant emits C^2 of Co2 while producing  E^2 energy. Then as long as both [ C^1 &gt; C^2 ] and [ E^1 &lt; E^2 ] are true, you could scale it to take a big chunk out of the Co2 emissions at power plants or concentrated industries. And if some part of the power needed to run the reactor is in order to heat it up, waste heat from industrial processes could help.

590,foxyramirez,"Dude, maybe in *your* country where regulations are an afterthought. The failure of Fukushima was one made from laziness and a lack of preparation.

Modern American reactors have mechanically based safety features that kick in with 100% success at meltdown prevention. Safety procedures and emergency systems are layered in such a way that nearly every potential catastrophe has been accounted for in multiple ways.

And if you compare work related injury and death rates to comparable industries such as coal or oil, nuclear power shows itself to be many times safer. My family has been drilling oil for 3 generations now; the chain on the drilling rigs has killed more workers by itself than all that have died in nuclear accidents. That's just the torque chain by itself.

Environmentally, nuclear power is by and far the most safe. It's emissions are completely controlled, it requires little fuel to operate, and of that fuel, disposal of the waste is no more difficult than the disposal of crude processing waste. And again, compare the environmental impact of oil catastrophe to nuclear; oil has time and again proven nigh yearly to be in a very deep need of heavier safety regulation each time a tanker scrapes a rock in the ocean. 

Initial expense is the only cavet of nuclear power, but factually speaking, most nuclear reactors internationally are commissioned by their governments; in other words, taxes pay for the initial installation.

No, your assessment is completely wrong. Nuclear power is easily the safest, most efficient, and most environmentally friendly means of energy production on earth.",1568812113,f0oijed,t1_f0og8o2,technology,t5_2qh16

648,solar-cabin,"You need some basic education:

In a single hour, the amount of power from the sun that strikes the Earth is more than the entire world consumes in an year.

The sun will be around for another 5 billion years producing that energy.

Owners and operators of U.S. nuclear power reactors purchased the equivalent of about 40 million pounds of uranium in 2018. About 10% of uranium purchases in 2018 were from U.S. suppliers, and 90% came from other countries. The US can not produce enough uranium to even power their own reactors.

""Nuclear power is riskier, more expensive and takes infinitely longer to bring online than renewable energy. Very few, if any, utilities will want to move forward on new nuclear projects when they have cheap solar and wind to turn to. “Plans to build new nuclear plants face concerns about competitiveness with other power generation technologies and the very large size of nuclear projects that require billions of dollars in upfront investment,” the IEA said. “Those doubts are especially strong in countries that have introduced competitive wholesale markets.”

A typical nuclear power plant in a year generates 20 metric tons of used nuclear fuel. The nuclear industry generates a total of about 2,000 - 2,300 metric tons of used fuel per year. They have no place to safely dispose of that waste and that toxic waste is being buried on site where it will remain toxic for thousands of years. https://www.nei.org/resources/statistics",1568812821,f0ojf2i,t1_f0oi38q,technology,t5_2qh16

659,ZeBeowulf,"This article is pretty bad when it comes to the science and politics that actually matter. Firstly it's by a Korean source, because everyone knows Korea is totally not biased against Japan at all /s. Secondly it says nuclear experts but doesn't cite them. One of the sources is from a Korean Green Peace dude because he's definitely an expert in radiation. The other source, where the 300 years comes from, is a person who worked on some nuclear  council. Which doesn't mean he actually knows anything about how radiation works, just was politically involved. And you know only the most capable people get the job (as an American this hurts a little to much but needs to be said). 

Now let's talk about the science of radioactive tritium. The article doesn't cite any statistics on how radioactive the water is, the concentration of tritium in the water or any useful metric for determining jusy how dangerous this is. So let's compare it to something we do know, the elephants foot at Chernobyl when it was discovered put out a dose of radiation of about 8000 rads/hr which is enough to be a 50/50 chance of death in about 5 minutes. Now assuming that the tritium in the article is so concentrated and there's so much of it that it's roughly equivalent to the elephants foot that means in 5 Tritium half lives (62.5 years) it'll only be radioactive enough to cause acute radiation sickness, which is less than what radiation therapy patients receive. If you wait one more half life (75 years) the radiation dose will be small enough that it wouldn't cause any symptoms. In a hundred years it will be basically harmless. In 300 years it might be undetectable. And all of this is just assuming that it's some solid mass of tritium metal sitting a pile. 

Except that it's not a solid piece of tritium metal, it's tritium water. Which is mostly HTO and maybe rarely T2O in a lot of water. Which means the danger is significantly lower. Also the means by which tritium decays is by Beta emmision which means it spits out an electron. Beta emmision is the second least harmful type of emmision to be around. Beta particles are not strong enough to penetrate the dead skin on your body or your clothes. The only danger you get from beta emmisions is radiation burns but that takes a lot of radiation. The only real danger comes when breathing it in or consuming it. But even then HTO has a biological half life of a few days meaning that it doesn't stick around and doesn't bioaccumulate. And all of this doesn't take in that the tritium itself is in water which if it were only a few mm thick is more than enough to stop higher beta emiters than tritium. Which means that the potential danger in this case is negligible. 

Now let's put this in the context of the Sea of Japan and not the whole pacific ocean since it's a Korean Propaganda piece.  It's a massive body of water that is mostly devoid of life (3% of all biomass is in the oceans most of that is bacteria and bacteriaphages). The Sea of Japan has has a surface area of 978,000 square kilometers. If we were to take our elephants foot example from earlier and when it's at it's peak lethal dose, kill you in 5 minutes and spread that out over, let's say a quarter of the Sea. That means the radiation per square KILOMETER would be about 0.033 rads which is basically nothing. It would be undetectable at best. And that's just if the radiation was evenly spread out on the surface of the sea it doesn't take into account the depth and volume of the water. 

To be clear I don't want Japan to dump the Tritium in the ocean either but that's because tritium is valuable. It's hard and expensive to get so for it's potential applications it's definitely worth storing or buying directly from Japan and that's something we (the US) should do. 

So next time instead of posting a Propaganda piece because of it's sensational headline that works because people don't understand radiation well at all, including yourself. Do a little research, use a more reputable source, and don't come into reddit posting bullshit articles and getting defensive about it because you don't want to admit you're wrong. 

(Disclaimer: In the math for calculating the radiation I may have made a mistake, there are so many damn units for radiation that makes using multiple sources and putting things in context difficult. I am also aware that I made assumptions about radiation per time and dropped time because it makes it easier to do the math and to make it understadable. I'm perfectly ok with in this context because of how damn big the ocean is vs how potentially concentrated the Tritium could be. I'd rather it be easier to understand how harmless this is than be totally accurate. Also on mobile so formatting is bad I'm sorry.)",1568812975,f0ojm8y,t3_d5vvfa,technology,t5_2qh16

TEPCO elected to strictly follow General Electric's design in the construction of the reactors.

GE was the one who gave them those plans and then an American agency told them it was inept? They should have told GE that and forced them to provide a product which met their standards.

So no point building this plant unless you have the means to power it.  Next nobody takes a nuclear/coal/natural gas plant offline, unless it's no longer economically feasible to run it.

The flip side of this however is in jurisdictions with stronger personal health data security laws, the hoops that vendors have to jump through make implementation of e-health records and interoperability between vendors a nightmare of bureaucracy. 

In Ontario for example: our health privacy laws are so severe we've been talking about e-Health (like being able to look at your own x-rays and doctor's charts) for decades and we're still at least a decade away. For example, under Ontario's laws if you want to store anything on a cloud service, the servers that host that cloud have to reside physically in Ontario and cannot be synch'd or replicated outside of the province. Which kinda defeats some of the advantage of the cloud.

Algae normally takes sunlight and takes CO2 out of the air. This machine simply hopes to accelerate the process and have a holding cell for the algae to grow.

The amount of biomass produced and byproducts using a bioreactor this size would be a researchers dream, and with many of them I'd be willing to bet that they could produce more secondary products than the use of trees.

The only shit thing would be if people used them to REPLACE trees rather than using them in locations where trees aren't possible (cities or directly from powerplant co2 output). But I could definitely see this being a big win for the biofuel industry since you are in constant supply of inocula and you would just need to replace the media in the columns or add nutrients if the organisms are removed by centrifugation.

Here's the thing, electrical generation infrastructure, traditionally has been one of the most expensive things in our society.  We have spent literally Trillions of dollars globally on supplying ourselves with electricity.  In most parts of the world, it is done by governments as private industry (unless they get the generous support of government) often has little appetite to expend the tens of billions required to build nuclear plants.  That's why we don't have spare capacity nuclear, just sitting around for when we need it.  We do have smallish peaker plants (usually natural gas) that can and are turned on and off as demand goes up and down.  These plants though often only cost in the 10's of millions to install.

You're correct up until this point.  

&gt;It's about the joblessness, the tremendous increase in welfare recipients. I can't imagine how the multitude of millions who can't find a job live day to day.

Pibbybacking on the excellent economy the Obama administration had restored and then taking all credit for it and suddenly acknowledging the numbers that we're good for years is what happened here.  The BEA website is your friend.  Got all kinds of graphs on there to clear up these misunderstandings.

&gt;It's about the tens of thousands of new job killing regulations he has added to the books. It's about the massive tax increases that hurt the middle class.

Tax cuts for the rich that shift the burden to the middle and lower class is the only major piece of legislation he has presided over.  They rammed that through.  Numerous studies have proven that the tax act only benefited the wealthy.

Trump and company have mainly slashed financial and environmental regulations that were in place to protect the economy from the type of crash it faced in 2008 due to financial institution trickery and the kind of pollution of air and waterways that gives kids cancer (stupid fucking kids should just rely on the market to correct their cancer right?).

Versus you could literally put 3 of these things surrounding any wind turbine or solar installation.  You could distribute them around CO2 emitting sources, like factories or cities.

&gt; The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) performed a meta-analysis of studies that examined the long term degradation rates of various PV panels. They found that the 1% per year rule was somewhat pessimistic for panels made prior to the year 2000, and today’s panels, with better technology and improved manufacturing techniques, have even more stamina than their predecessors. For monocrystalline silicon, the most commonly used panel for commercial and residential PV, the degradation rate is less than 0.5% for panels made before 2000, and less than 0.4% for panels made after 2000. That means that a panel manufactured today should produce 92% of its original power after 20 years, quite a bit higher than the 80% estimated by the 1% rule.",1568816166,f0onzmz,t1_f0oiv4z,technology,t5_2qh16

The SpaceX Starship is less complicated than a passenger airplane, and is being built in a field, so lets assume it is ten times less per ton.  $250,000/ton is still way way more than the fuel, even if you need 15 tons of fuel for every ton of rocket hardware.

That's why the goal of the Starship rocket is to get back both stages and throw none of the hardware away - it's the most expensive part.

In terms of fuel cost per payload, the two stages have a combined mass of 4400 tons of which 100 tons is payload and 286 is hardware, leaving fuel at 4014 tons.  That costs $461,600 per launch, or $4.62/kg payload.

Not if you selectively harvest the trees, and turn them into durable wood products.  Selective harvesting is removing some of the trees, and allowing the rest to grow, and new seedlings to sprout.  You can also add fertilizer, which trees respond to like any other plant.

Wood buildings can last 500 years if built properly, and biochar (pyrolized wood waste) can last 1000 years in the soil.  So they are long-term solutions.

996,solar-cabin,""" Along the way, deceit breeds duplicity, as the aforementioned Guardian article says the Japanese government claims only one (1) death has been associated with the Fukushima meltdown but keep that number in mind. Reliable sources in Japan claim otherwise, as explained in previous articles on the subject, for example, “Fukushima Darkness, Part Two” d/d November 24, 2017, and as highlighted further on in this article.

When it comes to nuclear accidents, cover-ups reign supreme; you can count on it.

As such, it is believed the Japanese government is lying and should be held accountable for hoodwinking the world about the ravages of Fukushima, especially with the Olympics scheduled for next year.

For example, the following explains how death by radiation is shamefully hidden from the public via newspeak: Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station worker deaths “that expire at home” are not officially counted. Accordingly, how many workers on a deathbed with radiation sickness leave home to go to work (where deaths are counted) just before they die? Oh, please!

Meanwhile, the last thing the world community needs in the face of an uncontrollable nuclear meltdown, like Fukushima, is deceptiveness and irresponsibility by the host government. Too much is at stake for that kind of childish nonsense. And just to think, the 2020 Olympics are scheduled with events held in Fukushima.

&gt; You blame me for keeping hate alive for generations 

No i don't. But i can hold you accountable for this generations and the following ones to come. Just like i can those of the past when that was the present. As after all you are joining a hate filled group that is led by those who are responsible for the previous generations of hate.

&gt;and suggest that minorities should be allowed a far right and to look out for their own self interests while I cannot.

Because  it often leads better results than continuing to be apart or joining the hate train as i said before is literally going to cause more problems than  if you just stop the hate. Literally I don't know how many time's i have to say this. You are being ridiculous stupid and delusional.

This is VERY ironic considering how whites have been acting for decades and even now you demonstrating the same behavior.  You are projecting quite a lot of what applies to you and your race as a whole on to others is what i'm beginning to notice.

&gt; Which is why they hate white people looking out for their own self interests. You demonstrate this by blaming me for historic grievances against minorities to justify why they get a different set of rules and why I should go out of my way to favour them instead of myself and white people. 

 You also can't seem understand the simple concept  that i'm not blaming you for anything beyond your current contribution to the problem. You also can't seem to understand the basic concept of human decency if you do something wrong to others it's only right that you fix it. Simple as that.   You have no reason to favour yourself or whites at all. You aren't being attacked or remotely threatened you are just bring brought down to a equal level.Meaning everything will finally apply to you.

&gt; This is subjugation disguised as equality and self contempt disguised as rationality. I reject this.   Hate does create more hate which is why the far right is the only protection the white man has 

I'm not disguising anything but your group is. The entire far-rights premise is literally subjugation disguised as  ""just looking out for whites"" and  hatred disguised as ""rationality"" and being used disguised as ""a  sense of belonging"". You quite literally aren't going to accomplish anything beyond making problems worse for everyone including yourself. 

&gt; Make up your mind. Are you merely pretending or are you giving white people and minorities double standards. Your hate begets hate rhetoric goes both ways. I need to look out for my own self interest. 

There is no double standards here. Actually I'm wrong. You have quite a big double standard when it comes to what whites are allowed to do but not minorities.  Yes the hate begets hate goes both ways. That's why your race or rather the far-right,kkk, and similar white supremacists organizations are the entire problem and have been ever since the countries founding. Even the irish at one point weren't considered white after all.

Instead of leaving work and going camping you can leave work on Friday and spend less than $150 on a plane ticket and end up in a whole new country. My brother's doing it right now for school. I have been fortunate enough to do many of the things you mentioned. I don't want to diminish our cultures richness or some of the freedoms we enjoy, but your comment about Europe is just wrong. I've lived in the U.S. most of my life, but I also lived in Europe too for a time, so I know that your comment is incorrect and does not come from first hand experience. 

Besides you were comparing the U.S. to China and I was just replying to this guy:
I love how your comment got downvoted by a bunch of degenerate Europeans that don’t really have freedom of speech, press, or religion like we do. Everything you said was spot on. People just like to fantasize that America is some third-world slum infested hellhole, but it’s really a great place to live.

Both you and I agree completely. I didn't downvote you. I'm an American who's experienced first hand America and Europe. I haven't been to China, but based on what I'm reading online, I have no reason to disagree with your view that it should not be compared to America in regards to freedom. 

The only place that I'm conflicted in regards to China is that they have to manage a population of 1.4 billion whereas we manage 330 million.
You know just as well as I do that small towns have far less police and federal involvement than large cities. Just try to imagine how sheriff Sam's tactics or involvement in our freedoms might change if the population was to grow to 1.4 billion. I can't confidently say it would be the same free America. We may find ourselves with a similar issue as China as our population grows. I think it's naive to think things would just continue to be run as they are today forever.

196,czarcy,"&gt; I want you to take a moment and think. Why do things like say lgbt pride parades exist, why is there black history month or bet , why is black power okay?
&gt; That's because all of these share something in common. The purpose of each one is to celebrate that it's okay for them to exist because literally society itself has demonized them, because society has made a mockery of them, because society has literally done everything in its power to kill,torture, and hurt them physically and mentality just for being who they are. You won't ever understand this till you have been in their shoes. 

How is having double standards fair and how does this benefit me? How can white people ever look out for their own self interest if every time you will point to historical grievances from the past. It will never end. There will never be enough groveling because you will just point out to minorities being oppressed. Why should that stop me from looking out for my own self interest?

&gt;The reason why stupid shit like straight pride parades, white power,or the white history month nonsense gets so much hate is because the most common thing between these i that You have no reason to celebrate or to be proud or even need these society has always accepted you and will continue to do so that's why you don't need a white history month because every day is white history month, it's why you don't need a straight pride month because everyday is straight pride month, it's why you don't have a WET because every channel is WET . The second reason is that There's always a underlying hate filled reason for these. Straight pride parades are often by folk that are racist and hate the LGBT, White power literally has been used by people like the KKK and other racists as a display of superiority and hate rather than actual pride.

Yes I get that you buy into the concept of intersectionality and holding white people culpable for past crimes. Why should this collective blame you place on white people matter to us?

At first, it was under the assumption that uplifting their people will eventually make them realize the errors of their ways, cast off the CCP, and reunite with Taiwan as democracy takes hold of the mainland again.

It did not work out that way. Western companies became complicit in backing the CCP in the name of having access to China's cheap labor force for greater profits to their shareholders. They began indirectly bankrolling it, while the CCP engaged in IP theft that they used to catch up technologically. The CCP eventually used reversed-engineered technology from the west to build their dystopian system, littering their streets with cameras, and implementing a country wide database that can identify people at a whim.

They tested the waters already. The Uighur concentration camps is just the start. It's barely covered by the news, except from a handful of indy journalists. Look at how China is covered in the news lately. If you turn on CNN, Fox, MSNBC, etc., they're focused on Trump's tariffs against China, and barely mention Hong Kong.

China is treated as an asset in the west. And the west is hesitant to police China, because we did that in the 19th century, which led to the CCP rising in the first place.

If a system isn't acceptable when it's *turned against you*, then it's a shitty system.  Suppose that in five years some new technology giant emerges with a must-use system . . . and the company management is rabidly anti-abortion or anti-LGBT.  Would you be OK if they started deplatforming anybody who supports those issues?  Believe me . . . there are plenty of people in the world who are *just* as adamant about abortion being wrong as you are about the KKK.

Do you not see this as a problem? Do you think that somehow the gods will shine on you and people in power will always agree with your viewpoint?  That they will only shun those who *you* disagree with? Do you honestly think that you have ""the correct answer"" for *every* moral question that humanity faces?  So that *you* can be the judge and decide who is ""bad"" and is punished?

Having an answer for one simple, obvious question is *no answer*. A proper solution works in all cases. In your system, we need to appoint some type of moral judge to examine every person or group who wants to participate in society, and decide if they are ""good"" or ""bad"", and then disallow the ""bad"".

""A common greenhouse gas could be repurposed in an efficient and environmentally friendly way with an electrolyzer that uses renewable electricity to produce pure liquid fuels.

The catalytic reactor developed by the Rice University lab of chemical and biomolecular engineer Haotian Wang uses carbon dioxide as its feedstock and, in its latest prototype, produces highly purified and high concentrations of formic acid.

Formic acid produced by traditional carbon dioxide devices needs costly and energy-intensive purification steps, Wang said. The direct production of pure formic acid solutions will help to promote commercial carbon dioxide conversion technologies.

The method is detailed in *Nature Energy*.

Wang, who joined Rice's Brown School of Engineering in January, and his group pursue technologies that turn greenhouse gases into useful products. In tests, the new electrocatalyst reached an energy conversion efficiency of about 42%. That means nearly half of the electrical energy can be stored in formic acid as liquid fuel.

""Formic acid is an energy carrier,"" Wang said. ""It's a fuel-cell fuel that can generate electricity and emit carbon dioxide -- which you can grab and recycle again.

""It's also fundamental in the chemical engineering industry as a feedstock for other chemicals, and a storage material for hydrogen that can hold nearly 1,000 times the energy of the same volume of hydrogen gas, which is difficult to compress,"" he said. ""That's currently a big challenge for hydrogen fuel-cell cars.""

Two advances made the new device possible, said lead author and Rice postdoctoral researcher Chuan Xia. The first was his development of a robust, two-dimensional bismuth catalyst and the second a solid-state electrolyte that eliminates the need for salt as part of the reaction.

""Bismuth is a very heavy atom, compared to transition metals like copper, iron or cobalt,"" Wang said. ""Its mobility is much lower, particularly under reaction conditions. So that stabilizes the catalyst."" He noted the reactor is structured to keep water from contacting the catalyst, which also helps preserve it.

Xia can make the nanomaterials in bulk. ""Currently, people produce catalysts on the milligram or gram scales,"" he said. ""We developed a way to produce them at the kilogram scale. That will make our process easier to scale up for industry.""

The polymer-based solid electrolyte is coated with sulfonic acid ligands to conduct positive charge or amino functional groups to conduct negative ions. ""Usually people reduce carbon dioxide in a traditional liquid electrolyte like salty water,"" Wang said. ""You want the electricity to be conducted, but pure water electrolyte is too resistant. You need to add salts like sodium chloride or potassium bicarbonate so that ions can move freely in water.

""But when you generate formic acid that way, it mixes with the salts,"" he said. ""For a majority of applications you have to remove the salts from the end product, which takes a lot of energy and cost. So we employed solid electrolytes that conduct protons and can be made of insoluble polymers or inorganic compounds, eliminating the need for salts.""

The rate at which water flows through the product chamber determines the concentration of the solution. Slow throughput with the current setup produces a solution that is nearly 30% formic acid by weight, while faster flows allow the concentration to be customized. The researchers expect to achieve higher concentrations from next-generation reactors that accept gas flow to bring out pure formic acid vapors.

The Rice lab worked with Brookhaven National Laboratory to view the process in progress. ""X-ray absorption spectroscopy, a powerful technique available at the Inner Shell Spectroscopy (ISS) beamline at Brookhaven Lab's National Synchrotron Light Source II, enables us to probe the electronic structure of electrocatalysts in operando -- that is, during the actual chemical process,"" said co-author Eli Stavitski, lead beamline scientist at ISS. ""In this work, we followed bismuth's oxidation states at different potentials and were able to identify the catalyst's active state during carbon dioxide reduction.""

With its current reactor, the lab generated formic acid continuously for 100 hours with negligible degradation of the reactor's components, including the nanoscale catalysts. Wang suggested the reactor could be easily retooled to produce such higher-value products as acetic acid, ethanol or propanol fuels.

""The big picture is that carbon dioxide reduction is very important for its effect on global warming as well as for green chemical synthesis,"" Wang said. ""If the electricity comes from renewable sources like the sun or wind, we can create a loop that turns carbon dioxide into something important without emitting more of it.""",1567516426,eyvz3g3,t3_cz4pmh,technology,t5_2qh16

541,drsmilegood,"Okay, thanks for reading them and replying. The problem is people will not talk about The Party or Xi in a negative way. Freedom of speech is not a thing in China. They will slam the shit out of people and businesses. Mostly you find what is really going on in private groups, word of mouth and similar means. 

I know many expats and nationals who have left china over the last few years. None of them will publicly state the reasons. Most of them will in a really private setting go on rants of the levels of messed up the country is.

People who come from, have lived there or worked there are all leery about talking on the subject. There is some public information out there and I will add those links at the bottom. Even with those links you have to do some reasoning. Really though this is not common working knowledge for most outside those whose lives or job revolve around it. 

This is not really a conspiracy or anything like that. It's simply the results of Chinese culture, power and law all coming to bear to keep it quiet. China is a mess to analyze on a good day. Really though as my earlier articles show, people are leaving China. They are leaving quickly, quietly and doing so in high numbers.

643,VRtinker,"&gt; Could someone enlighten me as to why crypto-mining isn't the answer to ridding the internet of annoying ads? 

1. Because it is a terrible user experience. Site operators get more money the more of user resources they use, which basically means sites are incentivized to abuse the system. In theory, this should be addressed by crypto mining script providers, but they failed to do so.
2. Crypto mining, especially on CPU in the JS VM, is not an efficient way to transfer money. You pay a lot more in electricity bill than actually ends up in the site operator's pocket. By definition, since cryptocurrency is sold on an open market, miners can make money only by buying electricity cheaply and efficiently converting it into computations. I remember Coin Hive (the first crypto mining provider) published numbers like 50% throughput (Hashes/s) as compared to a native miner on the same system. Also, all miners use GPUs or even ASICs, not CPUs.  
So, to sum up:  
1. you pay more for the same amount of electricity (say, 12c/kWh average in US vs. 8c/kWh average in China)  
2. you run a JS VM and produce 50% throughput  
3. be non-competitive anyway because leading miners use GPUs and ASICs.

&gt;I'd offer up some CPU in lieu of annoying ads--no prob--while I visited a site. 

You should support sites you like directly by buying a subscription to their service. If you do want to support them, but not as much as subscription costs (e.g., $5/month = $60/year), buy as few monthly subscriptions as you can afford (e.g., continuing the same example, pay for 3 months in a year, totaling $15/year).",1567524100,eyw9d16,t1_eyw1n1c,technology,t5_2qh16

OnStar-equipped vehicles will get free hands-free calling minutes and data for the cars' LTE hotspots, and the OnStar nerve center will help out with coordinating emergency rescue and evacuation services.

Insurance doesn't go up because of pre-existing conditions nor does it change based on what happens while under insurance. It hasn't in a decade. That $20/mo is fixed and it's through the state govt of New York. Again to my point of you making overarching claims you don't really know anything about. 

According to the World Bank's ease of doing business index, the US is ranked 8th, with every single EU nation ranked far below it. 

And yes, sure, you can drive at 16, but for example in Germany it costs thousands of dollars to get a license, requires hours upon hours of classes, lessons, etc. And even after all that your insurance is expensive. The US has a much simpler and cheaper process.

MY point is that despite your overarching claims of the superiority of Europe, many Americans would still choose to live in a country where things are cheaper, less regulatory and give the individual more freedom and responsibility to take care of themselves, their travel, their expenditures and their quality of life. I'm not saying I agree or disagree with the policies and systems we have, I just think it's extremely naive of you, a foreigner, to come in and say, oh everything is so much better in Europe, your life sucks and you all wish you had the same governance we had.

890,hexapodium,"&gt; I would guess that the currently installed basestations in a place like Hong Kong would be 5G. This being a relatively new tech would more than likely be based on SDR and programmable logic.

This is very unlikely - SDR being significantly more expensive in service means unless you've got a real need for it (either having to be able to reconfigure on a whim, or it being impractical to swap hardware on e.g. satellites or extremely remote heads) you're better off with line-replaceable ASICs, at least for the transmitter and potentially for signal generation into the same, and paying for a tech to go swap them as required. This isn't to say that the units aren't somewhat configurable, but I would very much doubt they can be easily repurposed into broad spectrum jammers even if they overlap frequency bands. 

&gt; WiFi overlaps BT completely. And even though they use different modulation schemes a WiFi radio can easily jam a BT one. You wouldn't even need to do that much reprogramming as a lot of the WiFi chipsets have a TX test mode for compliance measurements. It wouldn't take that much hacking to make the radio go into TX mode at a specific frequency and that would seriously hinder if not completely block BT.

Agreed - but the overall TX power from even an enterprise hotspot being put into TX test mode at absolute ""melt the box in an hour"" limits is not going to put a dent in a bluetooth mesh network, just because of the inverse square law problem. A 2.5mW bluetooth unit at 5m is going to have more incident power than a 100mW one at 30m (and even a cellular tower has only a 500m-1km effective range, at 20W (average-ish power) and 120W (fuck-off huge MIMO 5G) respectively); and in a crowd where the average mesh distance might be closer to 2m, those distances drop to 12m for wifi, 180m and 440m for those two cellular examples. 

Short version: jamming meshes is highly impractical even if you've got shitloads of transmitters and five orders of magnitude over the mesh, and doubly so if your mesh is doing some sort of store-and-forward magic since then your mesh distance is cut again to a minimum-over-time function - if you assume that's 30cm as peoples' phones move close to each other, then even that 120W megatransmitter doesn't make it past about 60m.",1567532690,eywm6ry,t1_eywizzc,technology,t5_2qh16

I'm comparing one deadly thing that has valid uses and also causes accidental and intentional injury and death to another.

There is nothing unclear about this question:

&gt;Would traffic fatalities increase, decrease, or stay the same if we  stopped requiring license and insurance to operate motor vehicles?

Answer it.

&gt;My point is you want to stop murders.

I want to *prevent* murders. And accidents. And suicides.

&gt;Then they don't drive cars. 

Then they don't possess guns. It's a very direct parallel.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Now answer the question.  Why can't they be allowed to defend themselves?

Of course, people are still allowed to defend themselves. They just defend themselves *without owning guns*. Just like most people transport themselves without owning cars. I know this is hard for you to imagine. Defending oneself without a gun!? Another thing I've repeated, but I'll say again, because you still don't get it: in a safer world, you don't have to defend yourself as frequently or vigorously. Far better than owning a gun in a rough neighborhood where your neighbors are armed and violent is not owning a gun in a nice neighborhood where your neighbors are armed or unarmed, but the armed ones store and operate their guns and ammo safely, and tend to commit fewer violent crimes.",1567534020,eywo6pe,t1_eywi6te,technology,t5_2qh16

And that's the point we've reached. We can no longer counter them with rational arguments in the face of a world were rational argument and dialogue is no longer possible. As shitty as it is, we live with the reality of a clickbait-driven corporate media environment where nuance and meaningful dialogue is virtually destroyed, in the name of profit. 

Liberal capitalists created this environment, because to them, making a profit is more important than allowing a space for nuance, or even protecting their users from harassment. Just look at how easy it is for anyone to go down the youtube rabbit hole of anti-sjw clickbait and fascist sympathizers, and then join the ranks of brigaders or white supremacists.

Fascism thrives off of this kind of environment, because it doesn't allow for nuance to exist and therefore they can spread their dangerous ideology even more quickly to crush every other voice. 

&gt;  But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument

972,Dwn_Wth_Vwls,"&gt; I'm comparing one deadly thing that has valid uses and also causes accidental and intentional injury and death to another.

Completely different types of deaths and one is an inherent right and the other isn't.

&gt; Answer it.

Stay the same.

&gt; I want to prevent murders. And accidents. And suicides.
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

And yet you want to stop people from defending themselves from murder. 

&gt; Then they don't possess guns. It's a very direct parallel.

Agazin, one is a right and one isn't.  Transportation and protection are not comparable categories.

&gt; people are still allowed to defend themselves

Just not in the best way possible.

&gt; They just defend themselves without owning guns. Just like most people transport themselves without owning cars. 

Except no one will be killed by someone else because they don't own a car.  People are dying because they don't carry guns.  I can't think of anything more fucked up than taking guns away from people who are being shot at.  And yet here you are advocating for that.

&gt; Defending oneself without a gun

Which brings us back to the scenario you keep ignoring.  What's better than a gun?

&gt;  in a safer world,

We don't live in a world without crime.  People will always need a way to defend themselves.

&gt; Far better than owning a gun in a rough neighborhood where your neighbors are armed and violent is not owning a gun in a nice neighborhood where your neighbors are armed or unarmed

At that point, both SpaceX and ESA determined a maneuver was not necessary. Then, the U.S. Air Force's updates showed the probability increased to 1.69e-3 (or more than 1 in 10k) but a bug in our on-call paging system prevented the Starlink operator from seeing the follow on correspondence on this probability increase – SpaceX is still investigating the issue and will implement corrective actions. However, had the Starlink operator seen the correspondence, we would have coordinated with ESA to determine best approach with their continuing with their maneuver or our performing a maneuver.”)",1567535603,eywqk44,t3_cz4sx5,technology,t5_2qh16

the sender uses both public keys and the private key to generate the message and send it. if an attacker decodes the message using the public keys, it is still encoded by the first private key. the receiver uses their private key and the public keys to decode the message safely.

23,No0delZ,"I was in the same boat.

Back in 2010/2011, I installed a modified PRL to my HTC Evo 4G in order to roam on Verizon's towers... I believe this worked due to Verizon buying out some company that had a previously existing roaming agreement with Sprint that was grandfathered in after the acquisition.

I had to do this because I couldn't get service anywhere. My phone would roam on these towers with the default PRL, but often it would fight to connect to a sprint tower with 1 bar and be completely unusable. Wi-Fi calling was not a thing at the time. I was in NorCal... it was a lot of wide open area and things were geographically separated. My phone was my much needed GPS, as well as my communications device for recalls and emergencies.

I was a customer for 3 1/2 years, and in that area of NorCal they stated their coverage was excellent. It wasn't. When I *was* in an area that **did** get service, 3G was lucky to give me 2-400 Kbps, and Verizon's 3G was giving me something like 3 or 4 Mbps, maybe even more at times.

Sprint's WiMax, and then 4G worked great where it was available, but it was always so few and far between. I'd get it in small areas of San Francisco or Chicago, random micro strips in Milwaukee.

They called me up out of the blue one day, maybe six or so months later, and said my service was being disconnected next day and I should have received a letter (I never did). I was like ""Can... can you do that? With zero notice?"" ""Oh, well we gave you notice on x day at x time."" No. No they didn't. Not a letter, voicemail, email, or otherwise. They wouldn't take any negotiation, argument, or offer to keep my business. Ok. Cool.

I went to T-Mobile that day, ported my number, and never looked back. Had to upgrade my phone a couple of times from an S3, to an S4, and finally to an S6 to connect to all of the latest bands and towers, but service has been great. No complaints.
The T-Mobile store guys here are always happy, friendly, and trying to get me the honest best deals they can - even when I'm not looking to buy any accessories. They loaded me up with my Military discount, a small business discount, and a family discount. I'm paying just over $110 a month for four lines unlimited.

Sprint called me like 6 months later asking me to come back and I was like ""What? Hell. No. You cut me off with 1 day's notice. I will never do business with you again.""

They still send me the usual physical spam. ""We'd like to have your business back!""
I bet you would.

I'll be sad if Sprint's toxicity bleeds into T-Mobile. For once, I feel like I'm getting good service. Not perfect, but good.",1565986832,ex3k3ng,t1_ex3f3bi,technology,t5_2qh16

40,red286,"&gt;There's already progress in this direction.

Has there been any implemented progress in this direction, though (ignoring municipal elections because those have no impact)?  I know there are a couple of states (2?) that use a proportional system for the electoral college, but the majority just use a FPTP winner-takes-all system.

&gt;If you were going to devote energy to convincing people to do something, you don't think it makes more practical sense to convince them to push for alternative voting at the local level rather than trying to convince people to vote against their perceived interest for years just in case, as you seem to be suggesting?

In theory, that would seem like the easier solution.  In practice, however, people tend to vote however their preferred candidate tells them to vote, so if you can't get the support of either the Democrat or Republican candidate (whichever typically wins the elections), then those candidates will campaign against any change, and that will crush any chances of change actually happening.

Change from within is always much easier to effect than change from outside.  Look at the NRA for a pretty glaring example of this.  The NRA originally wasn't even much of a lobbyist group, they were an organization whose goal was to encourage firearm safety and training.  Then Republican groups infiltrated the NRA and turned it into a massive lobbying organization, first to restrict gun ownership rights (can't have the Black Panthers legally purchasing and owning guns!), and then later (after the civil rights movement died down) to fight against those same restrictions.  They accomplished all this by.. joining the NRA and then getting elected to the board, not by lobbying the NRA to change its policies (which is what Democrats are doing these days, which as you can see has had zero impact).",1565987111,ex3kpke,t1_ex3ioft,technology,t5_2qh16

Secondly, he doesn't actually say anything like that at all directly and so your claims for racism rely on interpretation of his words and not his direct words. 

Third, there's plenty of evidence to the contrary opinion of him not being racist. However that is impossible to prove, because you cant proven a negative. ""I cant prove you've never lied, so therefore you're a liar"" doesnt work. 

Fourth, you've presented no tangible actions that would support a claim for him being racist. For example if he were to fire a Mexican employee because hes Mexican, etc.

Without substantial evidence, your claim that he is racist is just an opinion.

108,JonPaula,"Sorry to report that those ""multiple sources"" are incorrect! Unfortunately, there's a LOT of misinformation about this floating around, so I understand how it happened.

The biggest error you made in your description above in conflating the appeal process (step 2) with the dispute process (step 1). At the first phase, dispute, there is virtually zero risk. A claimant can, technically, elevate the claim to a full DMCA takedown at anytime - but disputing a claim, or ignoring doesn't inherently alter their options - you're no more at risk by disputing than you are by ignoring it to begin with.

They have 30 days to respond to this dispute. In the meantime, revenue is held in escrow, and blocked videos are reinstated. If they approve your dispute, or let it lapse - that's it, you win - all done. If they reject it, you an now appeal. THIS is when you risk a potential strike. In my experience though, having issues over 2500+ disputes and 100+ appeals... if you're legally cleared to use the content (either in a fair use capacity, or you have permission, etc.) - you will win this appeal 99% of the time. 

And if you lose, you get 1 strike (of 3 you may carry at once). I've had over a dozen strikes on my account over the years - the trick is not to have them all at once. Especially since you still go on to step 3, the counter-notification. Which no one in the entire history of YouTube has ever actual lost unjustly. 

So yeh, if you have a right to the content - and actually go through each step in the system? You'll win every time. And the first step? Risk free, for sure. Anyone who says otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about, honestly.

With a system that prints out the text and the QR code together on the same piece of paper, the process can audited, which is good. If there is any hint that the tabulation process didn't go right, you can go back and count ballots by hand without any computer involvement if need be.

Given such a system, ideally they would spot check some ballots to make sure the QR codes match the printed text. Choosing ballots at random would be a good way to do a spot check because the randomness would make it harder for a hack (where QR codes misrepresent choices) to go undetected.

Indirect measures;  actual conversions, brand awareness, offer-response rates, etc.; tend to be much more significant, though the measurable signal is far lower (because doh!, actual response is minuscule), and can often take far longer (minutes to months) to measure.

If it takes you minutes to months to even begin a response to something, measuring at microsecond accuracy doesn't buy you all that much.

That's a _tremendously_ well-established principle in mass media.

Menckin's even earlier ""[Bayard vs. Lionheart](http://amomai.blogspot.com/2008/10/hl-mencken-bayard-vs-lionheart.html) (1921), applying the concept to politics.

And yes, this gets into the whole clash over what exactly ""quality"" content is, and all the classist chauvinism which _that_ question entails -- there's evidence of this in both Macdonald and Menckin's essays.

But it's also very clear that content and material which is objectively good can be produced at fairly low cost (once the talent barrier is overcome), and that objectively good, but expensive-to-produce material can find very little commercial success.  Even pop-culture classics (say:  _Blade Runner_) were commercial failures in initial release.   Numerous highly-successful works and individuals have seen numerous rejections or difficult times (and frequently saw success only posthumously).

High-concept _mass-appeal_ content can have a certain level of production-level requirements, but is still often relatively cheap compared to other content.  The case of the [1998 Hollywood Screenwriters' strike precipitating the reality TV trend](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/10-years-ago-screenwriters-went-on-strike-and-changed-television-forever_n_5a7b3544e4b08dfc92ff2b32) is a case in point.  ""Reality"" TV is _more popular_ (and more commercially successful) than fully-scripted programming, but it's also far cheaper and bypasses critical gatekeepers such as, well, scriptwriters and high-profile, high-budget actors.

If every bit of data in the database is encrypted, how specifically do you propose we handle decrypting the data before it gets sent to the user? Does it get decrypted at the client, or at the server? If at the client, then how do you propose we make sure said data doesn't get sent to a client who shouldn't be able to read that data? If at the server, how do you know the request which triggers the decryption is coming from a user who is allowed to access the data? Keep in mind that with either of these problems, normal access control checks (like ""if user == 'john' then decrypt data"") are useless since the attack is *already* bypassing access control.

Did you know that your passwords are not encrypted on basically any site? Instead, they are hashed. More specifically, they should be salted and then hashed. This is *better* than encryption because there is no way to ""de-hash"" something, so even if someone gets a database dump containing your password, they won't know the actual text of your password (unless they want to spend a bunch of time to brute-force it).

I wouldn't trust a site that only encrypted my password. That would mean an attacker has a much better chance of seeing my password as text, and therefore being able to use that password anywhere I use it.

My point, which is that encryption is not the solution for every problem, stands. It is definitely not the solution for SQL injections or XSS.

The only problem I can think of (outside of some really specific scenarios that don't apply to 99% of websites) which encrypting database contents would solve is the problem of physical theft (and that is only if the database and the key to decrypt said database aren't stored on the same disk or set of disks).

The closings disproportionately affected African-American communities. In majority minority Randolph County, a consultant recommended that 7 of the 9 county polling locations be closed ahead of the 2018 midterm election for failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. After the plan was challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union the locations were allowed to remain open. Kemp denied knowledge of the plan, but a slide from a presentation given by the consultant stated ""Consolidation has come highly recommended by the Secretary of State and is already being adopted by several counties and is being seriously considered and being worked on by many more."" Officials claim the locations were closed as a cost-saving measure.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kemp#Voting_rights_controversies)

Also there are tons of people that have been banned for ""hate speech"" or such when they did nothing of the sort.  for instance Paul Joseph Watson being banned from facebook and instagram despite him habitually disavowing the use of violence against anyone anywhere.  there are also cases like Milo Yianoppolis who made fun of Leslie Jones on twitter over the 2016 ghost busters movie and she got him banned for it.  ALL of the things that Milo was accused of, she was also provably guilty of, yet she was not banned.  More recently, a high profile liberal twitter user (Shaun King I think his name was... I'm not a twitter user) with a blue check mark has been openly calling for violence against ICE and border patrol and such, and even praised the guy that firebombed the ICE facility in Washington as well as antifa thugs... yet he does not get banned anywhere.  anyone who claims that there is no provable bias in these bannings, or that it's about racists and neo nazi is intentional blind to reality and to be clear, I am NOT a conservative... although apparently what used to pass as a regular liberal years ago is now considered conservative so who knows...",1565996053,ex41gnh,t1_ex0fvzh,technology,t5_2qh16

Let’s say 20 people are running, now let’s split them into two parties (because that basically how we vote now, and that’s encouraged by our voting system which is stupid)
6-14, now let’s split up the voters, a perfect 50/50. X=50/6, and y=50/14.

Now let’s say all but two drop out from each, but each member from both parties gets at least 1%.

45%, and 37%, and that’s with only a 1% from each parties’ targeted audience for each parties’ candidate. It creates a 12% difference.  In this case, only 12% of people’s votes are now not being counted. It’s even worse in normal elections, if you look at the previous elections.

 - What's the ""proof-of-X"" that is ensuring the immutability of the blockchain?
 - How to guarantee that a 50% attack doesn't happen (let's say, by a rogue nation that's willing to dump a bunch of money on hardware to change our elections)?
 - (depending on some of the answers above) How to guarantee that some government entity within the U.S. isn't stuffing ballots by generating their own ""vote coins"" to spend however they wish?
 - (depending on some of the answers above) How to guarantee that a user's vote actually makes it *into* the blockchain, and how to ensure that the vote wasn't changed before it got there (let's say there's some malware that silently alters or drops a user's vote when they send it out, for example)?
 - (depending on some of the answers above) How to deal with orphaned blocks?

You can get immutable votes using some other methods, which might eliminate *some* of the above problems altogether.

There are problems with it but when I first thought through these I believe there are other technologies that could work together with blockchain to ensure these voting transactions. There are also pros and cons to these. Do we use facial recognition for each voter? Probably not going to get people on board with that. The use of social security numbers? Absolutely not going to work. There has to be a combination of available tech to handle this. 

-How do we guarantee only citizens are voting now? 
This may never be solved. What we do now with voter registration now is a joke and outdated but we trust it. 

-Vote coins
You could administer 1 vote coin per registered voter but even the coin idea may not be the best use of blockchain just the most successful use we've seen so far. 

-immutable data proof of x
The fact is blockchain is not 100% immutable but what goes into rewriting a blockchain is insane. This goes into more detail about it 
https://www.verypossible.com/blog/blockchain-explained-how-does-immutability-work

-50% attack
There would be an exact number of transactions that occur close to how many votes are cast now a 50% attack I believe would have to increase this number to a notable difference yet nullifying the results maybe?

Yep, agreed. In this scenario, I can think of three ways to ensure that only citizens are voting, assuming we must keep the requirement of secret ballots (due to the problems mentioned by /u/Astaro):

 - You use blockchain, and you get one ""vote coin"" when you register to vote. Only the government can issue coins; there is no way for citizens to ""mine"" them. You ensure that the vote can't be tied back to the voter in some way (I think there are some neat cryptocurrencies that might have solved this? maybe not). Problems include:
    - Still have to solve the problem of governments possibly ballot-stuffing.
    - Still have to validate a bunch of software to ensure that it works correctly (votes enter the blockchain unaltered, etc). You can combine this with public-key crypto to alleviate some of the issues, but you still must verify that your cryptocurrency software isn't malicious in general.
    - Have to ensure that users can't hand over their wallets to someone else so that they can use it to vote, for the same reasons that /u/Astaro mentioned (this one is probably the thing that kills this specific design of blockchain voting for me).
 - You just use paper in a traditional voting style, at conventional voting stations. You are verified by the typical voter registration system, as flawed as it might be. There are independent auditors making sure that nothing fishy is going on during voting and vote-counting, so you have to trust that every station isn't doing something fishy.
 - You vote electronically (same voting centers, same voter registration checks), but you sign your vote using public-key crypto. You get some sort of verified receipt from the machine that will hold up in court if you detect that your vote didn't make it to the results (or if it was altered). All vote results are public, and everyone can verify that 1) their vote is there at the end of the election unaltered, and 2) everyone else's vote at least *verifies* against the signature to make sure that the vote wasn't changed.
    - You still have the ballot-stuffing issue, so you still kinda need to trust independent auditors.
    - You at least get to ensure that your own vote made it to the election results though, and since the votes are electronic, they can be counted super fast and super accurately.

Unfortunately, in *all* of these scenarios, the government has to verify that you're able to vote, so we end up not solving the voter registration issue.

In all three, you still have the problem of ballot-stuffing. Unfortunately you can't solve that without introducing the problems /u/Astaro mentions.

The simplest method here is 100% paper voting; public-key crypto gives you some more advantages for a little more effort, but doesn't solve all of the issues.

I'd argue that blockchain complicates things too far for not enough benefit over paper voting or public-key crypto, but it's probably still better than using electronic voting machines that you *can't* verify.

&gt; Vote coins You could administer 1 vote coin per registered voter but even the coin idea may not be the best use of blockchain just the most successful use we've seen so far. 

*(Oh hey, I didn't read this before my response above. Cool!)* Yeah, it might be the best current use of blockchain, agreed.

&gt; immutable data proof of x The fact is blockchain is not 100% immutable but what goes into rewriting a blockchain is insane. This goes into more detail about it https://www.verypossible.com/blog/blockchain-explained-how-does-immutability-work
&gt;
&gt; 50% attack There would be an exact number of transactions that occur close to how many votes are cast now a 50% attack I believe would have to increase this number to a notable difference yet nullifying the results maybe?

Yep, I hinted at that with my ""for all intents and purposes"" in the previous post. It's still worth noting that a malicious actor (Russia, China, etc) could theoretically overpower the network and re-write the voting blockchain. Not sure if there's a solution here from other cryptocurrencies?

&gt; Malware This I'm not too sure about my friend. I'd have a lot more questions about this too. I'm only familiar with malware related to crytpo mining but nothing that affects transactions. (Let me know if you know of anything that does that) 

I don't know of anything in particular that exists today, but it's not unreasonable to imagine some malware being created that man-in-the-middle's the user:

user casts vote --&gt; malware detects a vote being sent out to the blockchain, and alters it before the packets get sent out --&gt; blockchain records whatever the malware wants

Especially when the payoffs are as large as ""we can change how this superpower of a country behaves for the next four years"".

The way around that is paper ballots, which can't be MITM'd.

&gt; As you can see I dont have the answers. I do see the issues tho. I believe blockchain plus other tech is something that could be used to improve the security of elections. This would probably take an army of tech leaders and great minds to solve.

You at least humored me better than the previous conversations I had, so kudos :)

I think it would be extremely interesting (let alone massively beneficial to the world) to solve this problem, and maybe all it takes is one more breakthrough to go from crypto**currency** to crypto**voting**.

If you are proposing a system where the user can't see their raw votes, but can see a running total change as they cast their vote, you're going to run into a couple of problems.
Either the running total is too specific, and observers will be able to de-anonymise votes. (Even if the total is for several voting stations, this will be a problem during quiet hours).
Or the total is for a very large area, and will update too fast for the user to verify the count.

I just learned of these blacklisting documents yesterday perusing Twitter and this journalist also is on Twitter so it seems like she's trying to deflect from any bad press any of these tech companies who do these nefarious practices would receive after this news came out. Like she only wrote this article with an ulterior motive...

Basically, I think this journalist is trying to make it seem like this blacklist was no big deal by giving a reason for any platform to have whatever subject they want blacklisted without even announcing that publicly (shadowbanning people they disagree with). I hope it's not the case but that's what I believe because she didn't write this article months prior - she conveniently wrote it today... From what I've gathered, there was a reason these company's didn't want these blacklist documents to go public and that's because they knew what they were doing would rightfully get them ostracized by the public.

The difference in cost is larger than the subsidies (which in large part are just to pay for R&amp;D).

You have no evidence that these supposed idiot drivers exist in any statistically relevant numbers. You might as well say that some cab drivers were stupid to buy the medallion as an investment.

If you want to be mad at Trump it's easy.  You can't even watch one night of late night without the propaganda arm saying something anti-trump.  As a conservative you either just turn it off or tune out.  

Like if I went into /r/politics or something and saw the 1000 anti-trump posts a day I'm not going to go hmmm I'd love to pay more in taxes.  No system is fair but the idea that we are entitled to someone elses money morally I'm just against.  It's going to be close in 2020 but usually the incumbent has a solid chance.

We only live a short life.. not all of us want to spend time so engaged and mad at each other just for supporting someone that we burn our own lives in the process.

T\_D getting put into quarantine on reddit.. Jussie Smollett faking a narrative and getting away with it.. getting called a racist because you voted for Trump.. etc the list goes on and on so it hardly even matters what Trump does at this point it's the fear of what Democrats want to do that will continue to get votes for Trump.  

Now in 2024 the GOP isn't exactly popular and they likely won't have some reality TV star candidate.. and voting for a Romney character or Paul Ryan or someone isn't going to have the same pull so I think America goes blue as the pendulum never really stops swinging as those who aren't happy with their life will always want to try to change the gears at the top in hope something will change.",1566005730,ex4ja57,t1_ex43hty,technology,t5_2qh16

If you want to know why I'm going to vote for Trump again, it's because I really don't give a single shit about people (especially foreign nationals) saying he's embarrassing.  What I care about is the actions those governments are doing.  They throw out their insults at Trump and then turn around and concede to Trump.  It's why NATO defense spending has increased more in the last 2 years than it did in the previous 5 combined.  It's why Mexico and Canada both signed onto a new trade agreement which directly benefits the US.  It's why Mexico is helping fight against illegal immigration from central america.  

To sum it up, I put zero value in charisma.  If you can give a great speech, good for you but if that doesn't translate into any action and more specifically action that benefits the people you are representing, then it's worthless.  That's why I view Obama's tenure as a failure because for all his great speeches, his biggest accomplishments are more failure than accomplishment.  Giving a speech and then turning around and droning more people than any other president while failing to quell Syria is exactly the problem.

First understand, I'm not begrudging anyone of their opinion of how much freedom we should trade for safety... we know what Ben Franklin said about that.  With that being said; I've been in the industry for 25+ years.  I started as an engineer in the military and have done many contracts as a civilian since.  My specialty is data and intelligence and I've worked with everything from top secret government data to medical personal information.  The system that's used to assess threats does indeed collect phone numbers, names, addresses, street camera vid, texts, internet chat and browsing history..  yes \*all that\*.  What you need to know though is that this information is ""de-identified"" and unusable in it's raw form.  It's called \*metadata\*.  Metadata is data about data, not the data itself.  So here's a scenario; I'm an average Joe and I talk to 10 different people on my cell phone regularly.  None of those other people are on any terrorist watch lists.  I'm good to go.  No one can ever access any of my information.  NOW, I meet a new buddy and we start talking on the phone every Friday at 2.  It turns out that this new friend is a known terrorist who's being watched.  When our phones connect, especially if I have other known associations, this flags the system that there's a new data connection to follow.  When NSA/FBI/CIA pulls this up, they don't see my name, phone number, conversations, etc. they just see PA21053.  They see how many times PA1053 connected to the known terrorists, and if there were other significant data points such as internet, street cameras, etc.  They can't listen to my conversation, see my name, or see my pic yet.  If the (very busy so they don't have time for nonsense) investigator believes that my metadata needs to be unlocked so he can follow through and find out if we're talking about another 9/11 or something, he does a full writeup and takes it to a judge to prove it.  If the judge deems there's something there, he provides a warrant.  At this point the Agent uses the warrant to unlock the metadata and turn it into personally identifiable information.  I know I know.. people abuse power.  However, there's a protocol in place (and though I'm sure it's not perfect) it places checks on turning metadata into PII like the two key system in a nuclear launch.  So no, Agent Smith is not seeing which vids you looked at on pornhub. Also, we have checks and balances in place so no one person has control of something they could exploit.  I blew the whistle on a potential PII data problem myself.  I didn't take it to the media or hand it over to the Russians.. I got with my boss and wrote it up, then I spent three full days with the FBI helping them understand how to spot and prevent it.  We're not a perfect country, and we damn sure don't have a perfect government..  but there are still Americans like me and you running everything..  it's still a government for the people and by the people.. and it's the freest and most honorable system out there.  

If you think you know better than me about this stuff.. I'm glad you're so confident.. but we won't be verbally sparring over it.  These are my experiences, not my second hand opinions, and experience shouldn't be subject to a long reddit debate.  Just take it or leave it.

In most cases, it isn't, and the very few places where it is illegal is only because of lobbying by the taxis. It's certainly not about consumer welfare. 

&gt; Its adds to congestion, it results in poorer service for the disabled, it allows new forms of racial discrimination that cannot be tracked or prosecuted, etc.

I don't see how you possibly make this argument. Taxis can easily pass you by without a trace, but Uber actually records the data about accepted rides, and they're far harder to back out of. 

I have no problems with regulation of Uber and/or taxis *in general*, but those regulations must be solely to ensure the base quality and safety of the service, not to pad profit margins. The fact that Uber is often considered higher quality than taxis despite being more convenient and cheaper says a lot about the current state of things.",1566006759,ex4lhpq,t1_ex4kqso,technology,t5_2qh16

Some would disagree with you but either way the Constitution is more than it's Amendments. In Section 8, Paragraph 1 it says:

National Security, in the information age, is heavily dependent on the ability to act in real time to threats from foreign and sometimes domestic threats. ""Threat"" is determined by laws, which are created by Congress and upheld by the Executive Branch.

&gt;It's gotta be sealed pretty well so that it's not polluting the general area. It's also very important to have a painting area temperature controlled as you are going to effect the paint jobs if you do it in very different temperatures.

Well, it's actually sealed to keep contaminant *out,* not pollution in, as pollution is a concern across the entire process, but it's not significantly different than the rest of the plant.  And more than paint happens in the paint shop.  The average one is somewhere around 20-30 acres in area, and only a portion of this is primer and top coat.  That area *is* temperature controlled, but not all plants cool the rest of their shops, especially since high capacity conveyor ovens are needed to cure the vehicles and this raises ambient temperature drastically.

Point being though, some plants (*cough*Ford*cough*) indeed only bother to cool critical processes.  On the other hand, some plants (Toyota, Nissan) consistently cool their entire shops, when it's clearly not necessary and obviously an extra cost.

Amazon has built a huge number of new warehouses in recent years, and they're in comparable size to a single paint shop, and nowhere close to a whole auto-plant.

Georgia's FAQ covers their view on this, which is basically that having a ""ballot marking device"" catches errors and increases accessibility:

&gt; [Ballot marking devices (BMDs) offer reliability
and assurance, balancing the need for both
security and accessibility in the voting process.
BMDs have proven to reduce the rate of
undervotes, overvotes and stray-marked votes in
elections. They can specifically alert voters if they
have skipped or missed a ballot selection,
ensuring that all voting choices are complete. The
system also provides full accessibility for people
with disabilities and/or language or literacy
challenges, allowing all voters to privately and
independently cast a ballot using the same
system. BMDs also produce paper ballots for
auditing and reduce paper volumes overall.](https://sos.ga.gov/admin/uploads/Voter%20FAQ.pdf)

I don't know if that view is borne out by any real research, but it seems plausible at least that different methods of entering information (on a computer screen vs. on paper) could have different error rates. There were certainly complaints about paper ballot design in the 2000 election (like the [butterfly ballots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_United_States_presidential_election_recount_in_Florida) and page layout issues on some other ballots), so it's not a given that hand-marking a piece of paper is a completely error-free or unbiased process.

On the other side of the argument, a recent paper by a computer scientist [argues against them](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3375755). One of the key points there is that, even if voters *can* verify a piece of paper, in practice they often don't bother.

I'm not sure I personally have a strong opinion on whether a ballot-marking device is a good idea, but I do think *if* you're going to have one, the preferred way to make it would be if the voter can verify the same information that the tallying machines will read.",1566008752,ex4pmyv,t1_ex4jzaf,technology,t5_2qh16

The other option is you meant there's a human verification step *and* the QR code, (I originally thought you meant humans=voter when you said ""humans read text"") but that's just extra effort and no less secure than #1, with just human verification.  If you've already got humans counting the ballots, why bother with QR?

Carter Page was also named as one of the targets of Russian actors who were tasked with influencing the election and working on a deal for the reversal of sanctions on Russian oligarchs for their action in Ukraine.  This was not information that came via the Steele Dossier by the way. 

In the Steele Dossier there was a claim that meeting took place in Russia with Carter Page to try and recruit him.  Page denied he made that trip.  FBI evidence later showed Page lied about not being there at that time and has since retracted that statement under the agreement that he wouldn't face legal consequences to lying to them about this.

The short of it is, Capitalism by it's very nature consumes it's self. Economics says, that businesses should cater to the consumer. However, the nature of businesses says that profit is the only goal. Ergo, a conflict (every Marxists favorite). 

Let's analyze the basic fundamentals however (for the sake of time). Basically. The core of an economy is consumerism. Without consumers to buy products, there is no such thing as business. Thus, without consumers being able to buy stuff, the economy collapses. (Fun examples are for another time). Profit however says that wages are a loss, when in reality wages are the penultimate gain. So, ""profit"" and ""consumerism"" are inherently incompatible. So, it's a feedback loop. More consumer empowerment creates a positive feedback loop. Business empowerment creates a negative one. 


---------------

To quickly finish this up, and for the sake of explaining the who socialist angle, here's a quick overview of that. Socialism can be seen as attempting to prevent Capitalism from complaining by removing the barriers to success and failure. As a simplified (as much as possible) example; High taxes not only help with your programs but raise the risk of failure. This resolves two critical issues. 

1. Businesses are never going to grow large enough that they can ignore everyone.

While many wealthy continued their shaving practices for quite some time (to distinguish themselves as cultured men of means), it eventually fell out of fashion for hygiene reasons when the young US suffered perfume shortages as prices skyrocketed after several bad fragrance crop harvests.

10,lookmeat,"What I mean with that is that you need a government taking the job of a middleman for the monopoly. That is ""just"" a free market won't work, but that doesn't mean it won't work for everything, just some parts. Most one-payer systems, or social healthcare out there still try to use free markets were they can, and still try to keep things independent. Because free markets, when they can truly happen, are better than government enforced systems. That's also why I referred to Singapore, that has a surprisingly light touch on their healthcare system, it works more or less like this:

* Every person gets a savings account for healthcare costs. It's an investment account, kind of a retirement fund, for healthcare. HSA in the US. Workers are required to put at least X% of their salary, and companies must match.
* A government very basic insurance, meant to help with things where you cannot pay from the account above. It's meant to cover dramatic and unexpected conditions (cancer when you are 23, etc.) vs the expected conditions (flu, broken leg, heart issues when you are 70). Premiums are paid with the above account, and the premiums can be lower for people with low wages or special conditions (old age). People with money will generally supplement it with private insurance.
* A fund to cover extreme cases where neither the savings nor insurance can cover it fully. Mostly for individuals, this time when everything pools up in the worst possible fashion. The amount you can get depends on how things work. In Canada and the US this would be emergencies services being offered even when you can't pay for them. In some ways this is worse, but looking at the numbers it's better.
* Finally the government has government owned companies that become public hospitals, clinics and such. They help keep costs low by being competition, and create the spaces to specialize on very rare diseases that are not a good business decision to be ready to cover. Private hospitals still do well and charge more, for the benefit of having a more isolated space (and fancier things beyond what's been proven to help). Public hospitals, on top of having the power of government to ensure reasonable prices (and prevent a surreal growth of costs as in the US) also offer subsidies to patients, based on income and other information.

All in all, Singapore does pretty well. It's the 4th healthiest country in the world. Moreover it's incredibly efficient in costs. Singapore spends about [$2,280 ever year per citizen on healthcare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita) including public and private costs. If that doesn't surprise you consider that Canada spends $4,508. In case your curious the US spends $9,536. All of these on the same year. I chose Singapore because it has a similar currency (1.36 SGD is 1 USD according to google)  similar GPC (close to the US than Canada though) and the healthcare quality in most metrics is equal or better to the US or Canada.",1565129486,ew57hwm,t1_ew4ox2d,technology,t5_2qh16

42,hamsterlickinggood,"\&gt; $31 million of that was saved for those affected.  Less than 5% 

That's not what the story said. How the fuck does this have 3,000 upvotes?!

&gt; Of the $575 million settlement, $175 million went to the 48 states  involved in the settlement. Another $100 million was doled out as civil  penalty to the The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The remaining  $300 million is intended to pay for consumers that can prove direct  financial harm (such as identity theft) as a result of the historic  hack.    


Over half of it is reserved for people who suffered direct, quantifiable harm from the breach. That is not ""less than 5%...saved for those affected"".

47,ThatOneGuy4321,"&gt;	I have people telling me that simply implementing such surveillance is infeasible. “Everyone will flood to foreign tech or open source; hackers will pull a Clipper Chip on it, etc.”

Those aren’t problems with the feasibility of enacting such a surveillance program but with the security of it. 

&gt;	Agreed, but it is the example question you asked me. And then you yelled at me when I tried to answer your question truthfully and with appropriate nuance.

I’m asking you ethical questions about it, I am getting nitpicking about the technical viability of it in response. A disappointment, to say the least.

&gt;	...then what is the point?

See above.

&gt;	I’m not even going to respond to these, because they’re obviously mixing the domains of domestic law enforcement and covert foreign signals intelligence, as I pointed out already.

Somehow that covert foreign signals intelligence ended up being directed at American citizens. Who exactly are you to say that the exact same thing won’t happen again?

&gt;	They won’t get it. It’ll be buried in an HSM, encased in concrete, in a vault in Cupertino.

Ah yes. That “perfectly security solution” I’ve been hearing so much about. No way a government with unlimited resources is going to figure out a loophole with this plan. Because if there’s one thing that’s certain with *cybersecurity*, it’s that there are *never any unforeseen loopholes*. Utterly genius.

&gt;	It’s not a sure thing when it comes to illegal physical actions, either.

It’s not a sure thing, but it’s much *surer*.

&gt;	Do you think that’s a good argument against literally any government power which could possibly be abused and where such abuse could potentially be not caught? 

No, only the ones that are most easily and most often abused. I would certainly like to see asset forfeiture banned forever. 

&gt;	Is not a fact. The only legitimately controversial program revealed by the Snowden revelations was a legal, covert program, approved by all three branches of government and was ruled to be constitutional by federal judges 17-1 and statutorily authorized 15-

Then it shows that your court order requirement for mass surveillance is not even remotely close to a perfect (or even adequate) solution and your point is moot. If it can be abused even with permission from some court, then it’s a shitty system and should not be put into place.",1565130195,ew58hz3,t1_ew56vg0,technology,t5_2qh16

123,brkdotjs,"&gt;I don’t see the problem.

The problem is that Yelp saw that when people looked up ""phone number for [restaurant]"", Yelp was typically the top result. So now, instead of giving you the phone number for that restaurant, they're silently giving you a ""Grubhub-affiliated number"", and customers may unknowingly be placing their order through Grubhub.

If I owned a restaurant, I'd set up with Grubhub so people can quickly order through the app, or get it delivered, or get my restaurant recommended -- three avenues that I wouldn't have the time or manpower to do on my own, so I'm happy to give a small cut.

What I *wouldn't* want, though, is for Yelp to sneakily and knowingly promote the Grubhub number instead of my own, because Yelp and Grubhub have some partnership. This means I'm now paying commission on orders from people who just want to call the restaurant directly, which I shouldn't have to be worrying about, since I employ people to handle the phones.

This decision is under-handed, seemingly done ""behind the backs"" of restaurant owners, and will lead to small restaurants losing more money just so Yelp can make more. Absolute scummy move.",1565131484,ew5adin,t1_ew56slg,technology,t5_2qh16

138,Im_not_JB,"&gt; Those aren’t problems with the feasibility of enacting such a surveillance program but with the security of it. 

No. They're legitimate questions of feasibility. If someone can easily download a little piece of code that runs on the device and can effectively thwart the surveillance, that's an issue with the feasibility of the surveillance.

&gt; I’m asking you ethical questions about it, I am getting nitpicking about the technical viability of it in response. A disappointment, to say the least.

You also actually asked me questions about technical viability. I answered them as best I could, and you yelled at me for answering them. A disappointment, to say the least.

&gt; &gt; ...then what is the point?

&gt; See above.

Can you repeat, but ya know, clearly?

&gt; Ah yes. That “perfectly security solution” I’ve been hearing so much about. No way a government with unlimited resources is going to figure out a loophole with this plan. Because if there’s one thing that’s certain with cybersecurity, it’s that there are never any unforeseen loopholes. And if there’s one organization on the planet that’s certain to not keep said loopholes a secret and use them for their own purposes for years until those loopholes are publicly leaked and it turns into a huge security crisis, it’s the US Government. Utterly genius.

It's interesting to hear you claim that the tech industry's claims that they're moving toward a ""perfect security solution"" aren't going to pan out.

&gt; &gt; Do you think that’s a good argument against literally any government power which could possibly be abused and where such abuse could potentially be not caught?

&gt; No, only the ones that are most easily and most often abused.

Then you would probably be interested to talk about ways that we can ensure that this type of thing *isn't* easily or often abused. Like running warrants through a judge and a company, independent oversight, and hardware/cryptographic guarantees.

&gt; Then it shows that your court order requirement for mass surveillance is not even remotely close to a perfect (or even adequate) solution and your point is moot. If it can be abused even with required permission from some court, then it’s a shitty system and should not be put into place.

No. This is an entirely different domain. The law and constitution are entirely and abundantly clear that if they were to even think about doing something like mass content collection on US citizens, it wouldn't even be 17-1 the other way; it'd be 18-0. There is no possible way that a court order would change this. What this example shows is that you're simply wrong about the factual nature of what the NSA program did.

&gt; If the only thing preventing abuse of this type of surveillance is the time it takes for the government to eventually find a judge that will give them a court order, then it’s a shitty idea.

Good thing that's literally the opposite of what I'm talking about. It's why I keep talking about methods to prevent abuse, and you keep ignoring them so that you can yell at me for answering your questions, or something... and then going off on the basis of your complete lack of understanding of the facts of what happened with NSA.",1565131878,ew5ayh1,t1_ew58hz3,technology,t5_2qh16

I mean, I don't think we're that far apart on most of the issues. You just seem to have some really weird ideas about what happened with NSA that seem to make you think that it's simply impossible to enforce legal standards for domestic law enforcement in the digital arena. This is probably the biggest point of disagreement, but it mostly seems borne out of what I think is still a surprisingly common confusion about the Snowden revelations (the years-long constant hyperbole in the press didn't help).

&gt; &gt; tech industry’s claims that they’re moving toward a “perfect security solution”

&gt; SOURCE?

I'm a little surprised by this request, too. It's a pretty common statement here in r/tech that tech companies are developing perfect security systems using E2E and such, and that even the most secure methods of doing something like key escrow are clearly some delta below this perfect security (which is, of course, unacceptable). Again, usually, this is coming from tons of people on r/tech who are yelling at me that I'm wrong from the *other* side. I guess I could start looking to collect some of these examples, but honestly, maybe the better experience would be for you to just start expressing these opinions here in r/tech more often. Start expressing the opinion that it's absolutely, totally technically feasible for the government to implement backdoors (sidenote just because I re-read this sentence and it hurt me a bit: I have a long-standing, nitpicky position that the term ""backdoor"" is ill-defined, but I'm going to let it stand here because I don't want to replace it with something more wordy/complicated). Start expressing the opinion that tech companies aren't actually going to provide perfect security. If you do those things, I think you'll receive a lot of downvotes and hate. (Of course, it's possible that if you simultaneously express those opinions while saying, ""Fuck the NSA/FBI,"" you might get some confused upvotes.)

312,stereomatch,"According to some data points mentioned in the android sub-reddit, the skew is much more against the headphone port on the higher priced models.  That is, a higher proportion of models are without that port for the flagship models.  In contrast the budget or low priced android devices have a higher proportion that retain the headphone port.

Ironically, in the Android world, the Pixel 3a (which is the lower priced version) - has brought back the headphone port!

- [Google just told us why the Pixel 3a has a headphone jack, and it’s exactly what you think](https://bgr.com/2019/05/14/pixel-3a-specs-vs-pixel-3-why-google-brought-back-the-headphone-jack/)

&gt;Google mocked the iPhone 7, Apple’s first iPhone without a 3.5mm port, back in 2016. Then, a year later, the company quietly removed the audio port from the Pixel 2 phones, without addressing the matter on stage as Apple did.
&gt;
&gt;Google did explain the decision in a follow-up interview. “The primary reason [for dropping the jack] is establishing a mechanical design path for the future,” Google’s Mario Queiroz said at the time. “We want the display to go closer and closer to the edge. Our team said, ‘if we’re going to make the shift, let’s make it sooner, rather than later.’ Last year may have been too early. Now there are more phones on the market.”
&gt;
&gt;Sure enough, the Pixel 3 phones that followed were almost all-screen phones, especially the XL model.
&gt;
&gt;Fast forward to Google I/O 2019, and the Pixel 3a marked the return of the headphone jack. Sonyia Jobanputra explained in an interview the thinking behind this decision. If it wasn’t clear already, it’s all about convenience and affordability. The Pixel 3a does target buyers looking for cheaper smartphones, buyers who might not want to invest any money in wireless or USB-C headphones, given that most people already own 3.5mm headphones, and there’s nothing wrong with that:",1565135927,ew5gtdd,t1_ew5g97h,technology,t5_2qh16

You are finally understanding what I'm getting at. It is a fundamental piece of being able to trust the source.

&gt;Every video stream could be signed cryptographically. Basically, as long as their is a reasonably trusted way to attain the public key of an organization or have it distributed in a trusted way that can be verified to a reasonable degree it shuts down deep fakes pretty damn quickly.

Fair enough ... although of course this is always susceptible to the 'wrench decryption method'.

The point you are making is basically a small addendum to what I am saying, though: just like a notary or a judge we will always need to trust SOMEONE to be fair. Even cryptologically signed data depends on your trusting the person not to be compromised by cruel violence. But physically corroborated data is pure: it cannot be faked without destroying/compromising the entire historical database of previous states.

And, funnily enough, this is one of the very few case where blockchain tech can actually REALLY be of use.

&amp;#x200B;

Cable is one box (or multi box at ridiculous costs) on one TV. The bundles are archaic and forced, you can't just have X or Y, you gotta get the XY Bullshit Bundle. You want to pay monthly? Ooof that'll be an extra fee but we'll waive it if you sign up for 12months recurring. Oh here's a new service charge for no reason btw.

&amp;#x200B;

Streaming service have no contracts, flat monthly, multi device, ""family"" plans (split it with your friends, no one cares), some have no ads but probably a losing battle there.

&amp;#x200B;

You can realistically rent a season of a show for one monthly fee, which is a tonne cheaper than buying it on iTunes or whatever...which also do not have a rental option. Streaming services can be used as a rental option for TV shows. Once you binge that show in a week, you've still got 3weeks to enjoy the rest.

&amp;#x200B;

Streaming services are flexible, if you're too lazy to leverage that flexibility, that's not really a service problem. It is and was never realistic for a single streaming service to exist at one low price.

&amp;#x200B;

There's nothing to rebel against, you're fighting for something that simply was never going to exist. The agreements with early days Netflix was PURE convenience, they had the infrastructure and users. Might as well make some money while we build our own kind of thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Nobodies plan was ever, ever, to continue down that road. They were always going to fracture and they were always going to bundle. There's no way you're winning that one.

&amp;#x200B;

What we can influence is the predatory nature of cable packages, if they start to force bundles in hostile ways, if they start to increase costs but hey ""just sign up 12months, we'll give you the old monthly price"", if they start adding fees for multi-user, multi device, if they start monitoring what a ""family"" means (same household IP address etc).

They used to be called the Retail Credit Company. They had such alarmingly shitty business practices that it led to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Shortly after, amid widespread negative publicity, they changed their name. 

The company has never given a shit about its customers and has spent around a 100 years successfully integrating itself so strongly into the upper echelon of society that it's almost immune from punishment. 

They also pay excellent dividends, on time, every time. And if you had bought them near the low when this breach first happened,  you'd have made close to $50 a share so far, not counting the dividends that they've been steadily paying out. Because business is going great for them. 

As you might guess, I bought a lot of shares in Equifax. Enough that it's obvious, slow return to its stock price before the drop has taken a few years off of how long I have to wait to retire.

Lesser known is the Mystery forums. Where people try to solve or provide more (non political usually) conspiracy theories. For example some dude put up that he was getting these weird pings on his Ham radio. Someone halfway around the world was able to put 2+2, and found out it was a nearby air force base, and whenever they had some giant locking door unlock or lock, peoples ham radio nearby would get all staticky. This was due to the fact the when the door opened, all the electronic equipment inside the room created interference. The dude halfway around the world figured it out by calling up the base, and asking. 

Others are more up the ""fringe"" and requires a peruse every so often. Many people will put stuff up that they found elsewhere in the DW. For example, a few years ago, someone was able to access the file system for a somewhat popular website in their country. and found out what new feature was going to be in the upcoming release. This kind of stuff is fun to look for, since the DW kind of connects those areas that the mainstream internet doesn't crawl, or don't know about. 

Many security services will host a DW site, incase of internet/firewall blocking from a nefarious government. So you can things like protonmail, vpn sites, etc all have login and functional features so you can use TOR for messaging and more. 

and finally most regular websites also are accessible in the DW. Facebook, google, etc. THe largest pull for the DW isn't the drugs and stupid shit. Its the fact the everything is anonymous.

750,The1stCitizenOfTheIn,"**KEY POINTS**

&gt;Microsoft has changed the way it's charging customers who use its technology on rival clouds.

&gt;This change will effectively **raise prices**...when customers choose to run certain types of Microsoft software, such as its database running on **Windows Server, on another cloud like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud.**

|

****

&gt;...Microsoft has another licensing program, called ""**Azure Hybrid Benefits,"" that basically offsets this new change and its higher prices**.

&gt;So the higher prices ""will definitely affect prices for **its customers using VMware in AWS and the recently announced VMware in Google Cloud**,"" Miller said, but **not for most Microsoft Azure customers.** 

|

****

&gt;**Companies don't actually ""buy"" software.**

&gt;They license it, meaning **they pay to use the software in specific ways: in certain locations, such as their own data centers; for a specified number of a certain size of servers; and for a specific timeframe, typically three years**.

&gt;What Microsoft did was essentially eliminate a loophole intended **to cover software that's used in a company's own data center but managed by someone else**...

&gt;The loophole was that the ""outsourcer"" designation still applied even **if the company moved the Microsoft software onto a cloud like Amazon's or Google's**, as long as they used ""dedicated servers,"" where **the customer controls the whole cloud server without sharing it with others.**

&gt;Much of **cloud computing doesn't involve dedicated servers**. The original public-cloud model **involves sharing all the data-center technology**. In the jargon of the industry, this concept is called ""multi-tenant."" With **everyone sharing equipment in a massive data center, cloud computing can give customers affordable access to virtually unlimited supercomputing power**.

|

****

&gt;But there are apps that companies don't want to put onto a shared system. They may be restricted by government regulations, or the app may have persnickety performance requirements, or the company may just feel like the app and its data are too precious for that.

&gt;These apps are often extremely lucrative for IT vendors to supply, and there's **a land grab among cloud-computing vendors going on now for enterprise customers who still have these precious apps in their own data centers.** 

&gt;What Microsoft changed is this: Microsoft now says that **with all new license agreements signed after October 2019, specific clouds are no longer covered by the outsourcing loophole around dedicated servers.** (Remember, companies have to **continuously renew their licenses in order to legally keep using the software that they are already have in place.**)

|

****

&gt;Microsoft says that any customer that wants to run its software on dedicated servers on the cloud **will also have to buy a special service called Software Assurance (SA), which includes ""mobility rights.""**

&gt;SA is sort of like Microsoft's extended warranty. It **gives enterprise customers a package of extra features**. But it's pricey, usually **adding an additional 25 to 30% to the cost of licensing, depending on the products**.

&gt;If customers don't buy Software Assurance and ""mobility rights,"" **then they can't get an unlimited-usage license for Microsoft's software.** They will **revert to ""pay as you go"" fees, which will almost certainly cost them more every year.**

&gt;Microsoft names the following cloud providers as being **disqualified from being labeled an outsourcer: Microsoft Azure, Alibaba, Amazon (including VMware Cloud on AWS), and Google.**

&gt;But, again, although Microsoft has lumped itself in there, it **offers another licensing program that allows its customers to move their Microsoft apps onto Microsoft's cloud.**

&gt;""The end result is that **the costs in Azure will basically stay the same when running on dedicated hardware (like VMware in Azure or the new dedicated hosts for Azure VMs), but will go up dramatically for other clouds,""** Miller said. 

&gt;This change will particularly bash a top sales strategy used by Amazon Web Services and its close partner VMware. **Those two are jointly trying to get VMware's customers to move to Amazon's cloud**. Many of VMware's customers **use its software to run Microsoft applications.**

&gt;VMware has now allowed its software to **run on Microsoft's cloud, as well as Google's, Alibaba's, and IBM's.** But Microsoft and Google have made it happen by working with some of VMware's partners. **Amazon Web Services is the only cloud where VMware is doing joint engineering and joint sales.**

|

****

&gt;How important was this licensing loophole to Amazon? Enough that Amazon talked it up in its marketing materials: 

&gt;And AWS has **showcased Microsoft customers who saved a lot of money thanks to the loophole when moving their Microsoft apps to AWS.**

&gt;The brass at AWS is not happy about Microsoft's decision. Although Amazon insists it doesn't focus on what its competitors are doing, **Werner Vogels, its chief technology officer, sent a tweet condemning Microsoft's licensing change on Monday**.

&gt;He called it a bait and switch, saying that Microsoft has now rolled back a couple of programs involving ""bring your own license"" to the cloud. 

&gt;While this old-school competitive move under Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is clever, it's also dangerous. It's the kind of thing former CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer might have done.

&gt;If Microsoft's customers feel **the company is ratcheting up costs on them unfairly, they will look at ways to get rid of Microsoft's products, which has become easier to do now than ever before.**

|

****

&gt;In fact, CERN, the famous scientific lab where the web was born, grew so upset after Microsoft massively hiked prices by changing its licensing terms, it has **embarked on a program to replace all Microsoft software and help others do the same**. 

&gt;This is the third time this summer that Microsoft has caused a controversy by raising its prices. Besides CERN's price hikes, **Microsoft also came under scrutiny for wanting to charge its reseller partners for their use of software, too**, but it eventually bowed to pressure and abandoned the plan.",1565158241,ew68sjl,t3_cn1vz6,technology,t5_2qh16

After all why why would we have welfare support programs if this wasn't the case?

I figure if society reject in absolute its undesirables, it probably isn't giving the undesirables any incentive to work for society and instead leaves room to work against. 

I really don't agree with your internet argument though. If you give internet access to a Amazonian tribe, it doesn't mean that they will utilize it correctly. Beyond that, internet access has been proven to cause depression, suicidal tendencies, as well as a whole other skew of problems among underage adopters. So I think it would be safe to assume that simply having access to the internet doesn't necessarily mean an improved quality of life. If anything you could say that the unlimited nature of information on the internet is a hindrance rather than a benefit. 

I mean look at this way, if I put you in the library of babel and told you to pick out the most life changing books you could find, you'd probably pick out totally illegible garbage, not because of your own abilities but because the selection is so wide and most of the gems are hidden within the dirt. To make matters worse you would also have books disguised as great works of thought, philosophy, and logic which in fact where full of errors and circular reasoning. If an average person were to be stuck in such a library it would almost certainly be to waste as there would be no way to discern truth from fiction.

Regardless, I believe to think that we shouldn't help people falling into the hell fire which is elitist ideology like racism or homophobia, is simply to give in to the same tribalistic nature and toss reasoning to the wind.

I mean which would you rather have? A troubled youth grown up into a terrorist/racist ideologue? Or a troubled youth turned beneficial and working member of society? Are you really going to pick the former because the expense of society would have been a couple social programs?

Net Neutrality doesn't only apply to ISPs, it applies to all networking service providers that are passing packets through their networks, under net neutrality the CDN that 8chan was using would not be allowed to just decide to slow down the speed at which they serve 8chan's data or just not serve it at all when 8chan are paying for that service.

However Net Neutrality has nothing to do with the relationship between two businesses being cancelled, while that CDN can't continue to take 8chan's money and just not serve the data to people or serve it at restricted speeds it can decide that it no longer wants to host 8chan as a customer on their servers and cancel that business relationship entirely, no longer taking money from them for a service, and thus not providing that service.

If 8chan then got a new CDN and packets from 8chan originating at the new CDN happened to need to pass through their old CDN that dropped them for whatever reason, that old CDN would still be required to allow those packets to pass through equal to every other packet that passes through it's network under net neutrality.

Why should VoIP apps be restricted to use some Apple service in order to notify of incoming calls? That alone is a serious breach of privacy and security by Apple. If someone is using its own third party VoIP service or corporate PBX, Apple should stay away from it. 

How in the world are those apps going to work regarding incoming messages, audio or video calls if they cannot run in the background?

Let me guess. That is the idea, since Apple is launching eventually its own proprietary phone service !!!

This is so anti-competitive and abusive from Apple towards its customers. VoIP is an official approved Internet protocol. The FCC should investigate Apple for this if they decide to restrict it or cripple competitors on their phones:
